I can't everybody's name, everybody. The computer on there, the. There. Coke sitting there. Everything the wrong about it. You have nothing about it yet, remember everything about it, so. We went to. I had like 3030 days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing, mostly to see what it was first time. And then, um. We went to. After that, that's when we started to talk into. Getting the. Instead of saying, make sure I'll forget some 10 years before. But we did start like on ABC123 or something like that with my mom started to. It's in. Umm. Hooks, I went there. There was someone we got to talk over there and she talked to me all the time about remember how you started about everything, getting all ABC123 and three like that. And it took a long time. It's about a year to start over that and I've gone down. It was Monday to Friday, now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that, there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks. Just trying to talk a little better on that because I mean at this time I could talk a little better, but it's just hard to get back everything out of there. So that helps different things about it for those six weeks. How you're trying to compete or trying to try to ride on there, trying to do something about it. Get a little better there, and that's how they tried to. After that they started IU and that's when they. Started with noun verb. Preposition and all those kind of things.

My mom helps me all the time, still trying to rewrite everything, so I can't. I just get to rewrite things about it. After you do that, you do very good about those things. But then you forgot about the other thing you get back, so it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time. So you just got to keep everything. Keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still won't be able to talk. Mostly taking my time so if I talk too much, people have no idea what I'm doing. And they talked to me real quick. This is kind of weird because if one person talk to me, kills me. If there's. Three people I can understand other people. I can understand what it is, but so it takes time. I'm getting around everything, so. Umm. So it's just it keeps going every year and still can just get a little better. I don't know how long I can go, but it's just it seems like I'm still doing something with it so. Um, And it keeps going over time, so. So I try to ride everyday. All kinds of stuff I can but.

I went to bed on a Monday night after work. And uh. Just like any other night I expected I was going to sleep and get up and go to work the next day. About one or two in the morning I had to go to the bathroom and I was struggling to get the covers off. I was laying on my left side. So I tried to cover it up with the right and I could believe how heavy the covers were. And that was my first sign. Something was wrong. At first I thought because I had the two cats and I thought they were laying on the covers or something, but. They they, you know, the room was dark and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my mind and finally they came off and then I. Try to take some steps. The bathroom was the next room over and I was. Finding that I was exhausted. And I decided I would just. Lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. I don't know why I didn't think you just get back in the bed, but I just laid on the floor. I laid there for about 30 minutes. My garment told me what was going on, the timeline, and so when I got back up. I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom, so I didn't just crawl back into bed and then about. I was awake, asleep. Back and forth till about 8:00. And. I was trying to figure out something's wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major and I was trying to decide probably. Something wrong with my brain or my heart? And umm. I. Didn't want to go to the emergency room. And there'd be nothing wrong. But I called the guy from work. I used my phone and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number. So I want to leave him a voicemail message and I was surprised to hear him answer and that's when he told me you called my cell number. So I worked for a very. Difficult company to work for. And I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on, so I kind of jokingly told them. Something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified. I wouldn't be in that day and I said. Pass the word on my brains not working right today I won't be in. And so he just chuckled and said, well OK, I'll pass that on. And then I called a friend and told him what was going on and. Then between two of us, we decided. Well, my my idea. I will call him the half hour. If you don't hear from me, call me. If you can't reach me, call for help. So. Half hour later I called him and I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did. My neighbor next door came and got me and. We went to the hospital. I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one we got. Of four hospitals to choose from, so I don't even know why. I remember why we went to that one, but.

Slow about it or that slow but you know, just haven't done it as. Diligently as I used to. But for the first. Months. After the stroke I would.

And he's. Doesn't spend as much time as your grandpa as I would like them. And he's off doing other things, so. Here are some more pictures that also tell a story. Take a second to look at them and then, whenever you are ready, tell me the story that you see with the beginning, a middle and an end. Now first of all, these. Pictures are under the last four stories, so I can't see what's there. Two ways to fix that. We can click and drag the. Are like windows or you can minimize it. Alright, got it. All right, let's do this. There we go. Down below it now. OK, boys, out kicking the soccer ball. It got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad. But that window came through the yard. And uh. I'd say his dad. Saw it open. Looked out the window and notice who. They've kicked them off. Here's some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at all of them and whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see. It's a beginning, a middle and an end. OK.

The Ant was very nice. She made her pretty bad. She had to go work outside and. And everything else. And yet she's certain, the dirt and all that stuff. But her cousins were very nice. They got to do whatever they wanted and they're kind of painted, but. But umm. So that's how it was for all the time she tried to. Be nice, but they were still not very nice. But the one time they were going to have. They were. I guess they do for the. Sometime in the year they get to see everybody, so. They went to. See if this would be. See their Their aunt took the two. Girls to make sure they're going to find their. One of the the boy. The great boy is one of those that comes there.

Three days they were trying to. Basically. My heart was out of rhythm. And uh. Beating too fast. And lots of different things. So they spent three days basically just dealing.

You know, like with the pictures, you know, look at the picture, name the picture and overtime that. Gradually. Got better and better but. That's where I think start with the therapy was and then Parma Therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing. Go taking a paper and pencil and writing. I couldn't. Spell properly anymore. And so that was something that had to work at. So I found that with my keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with. No, but here you know the same thing it it has a spell checker and a spell. I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker, but.

Sharon had gone to get her haircut about 25 miles away and I was working here at the house. I was, I was, I was. I've been working on on doing some Carpenter work in the house. And. I've started to feel. I started to feel kind of numb in my right hand. I didn't feel too bad. But I knew from what people had told me, but I had heard that many times, the one of the signs of a stroke as a numbness. In fact, I remember I was a fellow that I used to work with, had a stroke at work. And I remember going through that and. Kind of recognize from that how looked. Umm, so I, I, I, I knew what was going on in the news. Having a stroke. Against my well. I probably should. I shouldn't have done it. But I I called Sharon and I said, you probably need to come home. I'm going to head. I'm going to go to the hospital. I don't feel right, you know, I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm better just come on now. And I said I'm, I'm going to start, I'm going to head to the hospital, just come on down there to the emergency room when you get here. So I I did. I went out and I got in my truck and I headed for that, went to the hospital, which isn't very far away. It's about 6:00 or 8 blocks away from here. And I drove to the hospital. And dove into the emergency room parking. And. Walked into the, you walked into the hospital and I said I'm, I'm, I think I'm having a stroke and they, you know, didn't waste any time. Said, OK, somebody, you know, where you come on coming back, we're going to take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They took me and put me in with them examination rooms. And they started to examine me. Sharon. She. It was about half hour away. So she got there after this had started that the. Questions I think. I I think I that it already taken me to a. To get a CT scan or whatever it was. Well. Before she got there so they they when when when she got there I was oh wait he had gone into to get a scan and. So. When they had, when that was done with that, they took me back into the way, back into the room where I was, the treatment room, whatever you call it that. Then there were emergency room. And. I I remember. Pretty well that you know Sharon was there and and. I remembered I knew what was going on at that. I've said that I had stroke, but it felt like it was probably. It wasn't getting any worse, it was just stroke.

And when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me, he says you had a stroke. He says it wasn't a big one, but he says you had a stroke. So that's how I knew I had a stroke. It was really, really weird. But I I forgot so many things, like in the morning. Every morning after I got my breakfast ready, I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper. And I couldn't read it. I looked at it and I couldn't get the words I could. I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words. And I what I did get to read, I didn't understand. So I tried for a couple of days and like the heck with us, I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days, I'm sitting there and I thought you were going to learn to read that paper. I started reading it. Now I read a paper and it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning when I got up, after I, you know, went to the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there. And I think my daughter's family. There's four people in the family. There's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name, but I couldn't get his name out. And the two boys and I would just close my eyes and visualize it. And gradually, all of a sudden, I'd see their names and gradually it would come. Then I went with my. Oldest son with his family. It was tiring and I did that at night too. When I went to bed, before I went to sleep. I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother and all that, and it was a long time, but it it worked. It really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day I said, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me. I says I am so tired and I says I don't do anything. She says mom, you are doing a whole lot. I said such as what? He says all I'm doing is thinking about this one and thinking about, well, that's it, she says. You are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it. But it all came. It's just now I I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out and that. And when I write, it's getting better. Sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything and all of a sudden I look at it and I thought, no, that's not that word. And the first time I saw that was when I made my first. When I was going to the store, my little shopping thing, I needed mayonnaise. So I'm writing and writing. I get to the store and I came to that word. I couldn't figure out what it was, that it wasn't even making any kind of sense, and I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping, I would keep going back at it and back. Now I have to think, what was I going to do with this? Then I knew what it was. They would come. I'd forget it again, but then it. But that's the way it goes. I know everything but. I still have to.

And I'm thinking he's just full of hormones. He's like, this is the last thing I want around my daughter. I got enough trouble with her. Well, anyway. They eventually got married and then, but she was determined. She didn't want any kids. She was just sure she would screw him up. And it's just too hard. And so me and my husband will just, you know, we'll just see the world. And they did. They did a lot of traveling and everything and and I had to just and I have a son too. But he didn't seem to. Have any interest in getting married or having kids or anything And so I just thought, you know I may never have any grandbabies. I sure would love them but if not then OK. So I just worked in the church nursery and and kind of helped get my. Maybe fix there and then. My son-in-law and daughter moved to. Florida. And. By this time, you know I. Realize. Through some different experiences that he loved her and was very protective of her and I was always super protective of my kids. And I realized he was just as protective of her, if not more so, than I ever was. And so I thought, he's going to cut her off to Florida, and I don't want her to be so far, but at least I won't worry about her. Because he would die for her. And so then I don't remember how long they've been there, maybe a year or so. And she, she came back to town and. A relative on his side had a baby and she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby. And she just, I remember I took a picture of her with that baby and I thought she just looks so natural with that baby, like she's held them all her life. And she told me I really want one now. And so I took maybe another year or two because she was losing babies. She lost it two or three and then. When she had this one. And maybe about six months in. Uh. I'm in Indiana, she's in Florida and I'm nesting. And then my house is reasonably clean anyway. But umm. But I cleaned my whole living room once and I just said, you know, it had been recently remodeled and so there wasn't a lot of junk in there.

The little girl was. 2 little girls, They look like they were dangerous people. And the cat looked like it was somebody that. The cat was like a funny looking cat too.

So then I think what you you got to see this, this castle. From the distance and I think there's this young, young woman and she looks like she works there. She probably works at the at the somebody's house and she probably had to like her job was to like. Clean. She was. She was trying to help out. She probably wasn't rich. But I think. They were looking. The the major part of the story, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna continue with this. Is that they were looking for a. For a young. For a young a young man, handsome man who was going to get married. They were and he was. He was probably in the in the. That place? Yeah, I said it right. But now I've forgotten what to call the castle. They were going to have a. Like a dance there with music. And they had this. Glass. Shoe. That they found the right one that would fit. That would be his. That would be his, his wife. So a lot of people came to the to the castle and they had the dance doing dancing and. I think this this young woman who was very good looking, she was like. And she had to work there. Maybe it was her, maybe it was the mother or something. But she had her two daughters.

Well, the last thing I knew before my stroke hit. Was what after my stroke hit. I woke up and I was like, I remember this, this was an Amsterdam NY, so. The next thing I know, I'm back in Wichita. And I'm I'm on a bed. My wife's there. And. And I slowly started talking to her. But I don't think I at at the first thing. I don't think I've made much sense to her. But she was always there for me. So it it it, you know, it was OK because I I could tell her anything I wanted and she'd list. Did or? Whatever she could. And then after a while. Two or three nurses would come in every day. And they would. Do crazy things like lift my legs and? Left my back and every day it was something different and I would go down the hall. And they would do. Legless.

And so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed and I laid there for about half an hour and I think I kind of dozed off a little bit while I was down there, and then I got up. And thought I'd try again. But soon as I stood up, I realized, no, I'm still just too tired. So I crawled back in bed, and about 7:30 or 8:00 I decided to call a fella at work and tell him that I wouldn't be in. My boss was a creep, and so I avoided talking to him when all possible.

But I thought, sure, I selected the desk number because it was really not even wanting to talk to him either. But I thought I'll just leave him a message. Well, he answered the phone. And so it had to be before 8:00, because I was really surprised he answered the phone and I said to him, Brian. You're at work already. And he said no, you called me on my cell phone. Ohh, what's up? And I said, well, my, my brain's not working right today, so I'm not going to come in. And I chose those words carefully. I didn't want them to know there was a health issue. But I needed to give him some kind of a reason why I'm not coming in, and I certainly needed to make that call and. So he took it as a humorous, and I was fine with that. That was kind of why I said it the way I did. And as a side note, when I came back to work, he recalled that conversation, he said. I really didn't understand. What you're trying to tell me, and I said no, Brian, I wasn't trying to tell you anything. I was. I was not. This was not a call for help. I already had in my mind what I was going to do, but I just needed to let you guys know I wasn't going to be here. And so he was really relieved to hear that.

I get that thanks to her and her wife and her and shade and a wing man. Showed up there at this this and the and Sandy's wife has never met a stranger. They she is a true extrovert. If you look up in Webster, extrovert and says see Sandy Barton. But anyway, so so she and her girlfriend and her her her wingman walked up to me and said why he is the is the the dance here and. Yeah, well I answered. All supposed to be, that's why I'm here. And and we I just I hung around. I I ran her that that that that dancing. And that's where we started dating and and we dated for probably three years, so dated around about three years or so and. And after about four years. Figured out that, well, maybe something's going on here and thought to get more serious about this. So it was just I I accused her of of picking me up at A at A at A at a school dance. As we were where we first met and she picked me up at a dance. All right, here are some more pictures. Take a second to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story at the beginning, a middle, and an end. They're covering up the the picture on the right.

A young A young boy looked like a A grade schoolers had a soccer **** ******* it. That ends up going through a house window.

She didn't say she couldn't go, but she had a beautiful dress in her.

And the at the also they were thinking we've got to make her make her better than she was before. So I'm a little lost in this one, but I think they did the magic wand and she changed from a raggedy person into rather attractive looking. Person and her name would be Cinderella. I think it says so. That's what happened. It's not over yet, though. So they said how are we going to get home? Well, they did. Changed her pumpkin into a. Into a.

And then when it was over Jeff said, have you ever thought to go back to school and become a principal? And I said, ohh, no, I love the kids too much. I wouldn't like that at all. And he said no, I think you should think about doing this. Seriously, think about it. And so the next week they put an ad in the. The schools, it was going to be a precursor to going back to school to become a principal, an administrator. I said no. And I said what do you think of this Jeff? And he said, I I think you should go because it is offered in land and it is all of the principles like about four of them are going to put on a presentation. And talk about it and then see if you would like to. And I said oh OK yeah, OK I will. So I went and I said ohh, wow. I think I will do this. And for two years I had to go and it was at Gordon College, but they brought it to Lynn because of all of the participants were from Lynn except for one person. So they. After school at the ad building, they would come and we would do a Class A semester and it was very interesting. It was. Ah. School administration.

Body was starting to have trouble, they said. So they wanted to start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that. At the beginning they started doing some little task for me, like we played cards to see how many cards I can find, looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that.

I couldn't say anything. They were saying like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me like a cup. Do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me and I go yes or no. It took me even harder to understand that this goes this way. If you want to, if you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out. Little things like that, that. I didn't remember. Then. Once I was able to at least think a little bit more, we started with. Pictures. Like that bird and the and the boy and the banana. And we start. That was our therapy. Starting was the fact that being able to say certain words and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name, my kids and everything else. So still working on therapy myself, I have a a book at home that I still do my homework every day. So still going I I'm the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write and I said but I told myself that I'm going to do it so. I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up. So you know I'm going to read someday and I will write. And I will have numbers at some point. So yeah.

I said. Why is that? Because you haven't. Filled up all that information, I said, yeah, I understand that. But I can't write. I can't. Communicate that way. So it's not my problem that's your problem. I said yeah. And I said want to tell you one more thing too, by the way, you're a *******. You said. What did you say? I said let me do that one more time for you. I was so upset about that. So State trooper looked at me and says OK Mr. Smack. I want you to get in this car and let's see if you could really drive. I don't care about anything else. Let's see if you can drive. I said OK, I was. I thought for sure I was going to have another stroke. But at the end of that test. And it's beautiful.

Being your license, getting licensed in one thing, being a friend of some other thing, I say you're right. So I learned something.

It was like 2, like 5, No 5. Fast. So it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can the, you know, the boat. But they let me actually mow it that like that.

It was like it was such a big thing, but it was, you know, and I was by myself on the boat, you know, I thought it was something else, you know, and all that. We forgot the gas one time. We had to roll back, stuff like that when I was a kid. But I think that was and at night we had a, we had like a a place to lay down outside and we would. Go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty. And I I think when I have my, if I have a bad night now, I actually dream in my head on that light cottage.

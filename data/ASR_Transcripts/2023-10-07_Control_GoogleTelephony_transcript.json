We had to put Clause off miles to, to be able to breathe properly. Smoke was quite heavy. The the paddling itself was not particularly onerous cuz the current is very strong and the McKenzie river but we didn't have a lot of pedal but minor ten hours a day to to keep going. We averaged about 72 kilometers a day and on the paddling covered almost 1,500 kilometers on the whole trip. And it would surprisingly enough, although we were on a river, drinking water was one of our biggest problems because off McKenzie river is a very silty River. You can't see a half inch into the water, so we had to find side streams that were clear in order to get fresh water to be able to drink."

Like they asked questions for which the answer seemed obvious. Why would anybody say the obvious wage? So people said the obvious and they were rewarded. So, those are the people sought after to be in the study groups. Not me. So, I did almost everything alone for the entire year off. And when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes, she said she had to get permission from her group because they couldn't share notes outside the group.So I said, thanks. But no thanks don't bother and somewhere along the line, I found a group that really didn't give a shit, anybody who wanted to could be part of them was me. So I was part of that group for several classes, at the end of the year, in the subway station. I met someone who I'm still friends with who I just adore, but we had a divided into two groups of fifty or seventy-five people and she was the other group. So I never saw her.And in the second year, things improved a bit because then I think I made a second friend. And that was good. Like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one or two in the year ahead, so that was a bit better. Has an example of the incredible snobbiest of the school and the students who all thought they were special. We had one class the second here with the teacher who was really a decent person.

I remained there for Three and half months and was able to get out of bed and walked and walking down the hall, and lost my balance on my crutches and I put my bad leg down and broke it again. And then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair and I got into bed and the nurse came inAnd I said, am I going to the operating room? And she said, yes and I went to the operator. We're almost put in a body cast from under my life. Under arms to the tip of my left toe and I had to remain in that for another. Eight weeks. and, I finally got out of bed and learn to walk again of course, cuz you can't walk. When you invest for that long, I came out of the hospital. My accident was October 12th came out of the hospital, March 29th. And that night, I went to University to write a test wage so and then I have to really learn to walk cuz I was on crutches at the time and I learned to walk and now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami Beach all over Miami Beach.and while in the hospital, they would bring ambulatory patients to my room cuz they were depressed. Disregarding that except for going for X-rays. I was in this room at that point for four months, but I took the approach that there's nothing, there's nothing you can do about something, don't waste your energy move on and make the best of the situation.

And then, on the day of, I believe Cinderella still wasn't ready found so doing the birds and the mice and all all the other animals tried to help her put together something, then they were stealing, I remember they were stealing like the eagles and buttons and things from the stepmother to put the address together and she was discovered. That was discovered in the months about stepmother, basically gave her more jobs to do walk-ins. So, she couldn't go to the ball and somewhere in the story. There's Fairy Godmother comes into the picture now.

And you do have time to to be cognizant of being in big trouble.In fact, I remember one time, I I I fainted I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house. And that was, I was really afraid of the fact that I was in a hard tile room. And my daughter was downstairs, I guess she was wrong, or maybe around 7 or 8 and I just end up panic. I said, dolly call 911. So I knew I was in trouble and I I I was able to just slowly go down myself and then I went out of the picture and the paramedics did take me to the hospital and I had food poisoning.And when I got the VIN now that was really frightening because, you know, they're racing me through the, ER, they're asking me, you know, all sorts of information and the pocket of disappears and then you know, testing and monitors and all that. And they said, you know, your potassium level is in the basement. So it was really and you know, you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and ends up either you know in the hospital or even dying and they told me. Yeah. When the potassium levels go down to those sort of sublevels, organs can start shutting down rather quickly so it was truly an emergency situation. So when my daughter is young as she was, you know, I credit Natalie with, you know, exact it wasn't worse. She, she just listen to me and didn't question it and dialed 911. Yeah. So I can imagine that a stroke victim. Probably has a little dog I think song. Right.Right."

For instance, I grew up in a family, I was one of five children and now I don't want this to sound, you know.Politically Incorrect. My father was Italian of Italian descent and he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college and unfortunately four of us were girls so he didn't that wasn't. He wasn't pleased with that either. I and I was the third one may imagine in a row. No boys yet? No, it was made very clear. That college was not on the map and took his his his idea was that I've been supporting you all these years and now you owe me. You have to go to work and contribute to the household. So this was a built-in thing at the time. I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it. That I'll be going to work soon birth.And the good news was that I was also an honor student and I got to high school at 12 and the bad news was at 16. My education was complete and now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal. I think when she heard it wasn't going to college because I was a student, she actually wanted to call him and I was very calm about the whole thing. I said, there's really no point. You know, it's you're not going to get anywhere. This is the state of thing. It's the state-of-the-art a household and that's that. So anyway, she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on Wall Street and who worked in a Personnel department at what was, then the Irving trust company, which no longer exists and theyIt's a great pride in that that company that they, they were one Wall Street and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street and this was verbalized. So anyway, she called her a friend and I'll never forget her name was Mary Unruh who I went to say. So, I put a suit on went shopping and bought myself. You know, very inexpensive, wage type of thing and went for the interview when I think I was a shoe-in because her friend, the guidance counselor had called her. And so she hired me and I ended up in a sub-basement, not just the basement, it was a sub-basement, I think I was lower than the vault in a secretarial pool, where else? I could be a genius when I was going through a secretarial and good. Good on me. I did have the wherewithal Wednesday.Is still in school too. Even though I had an academic course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study. And I and I I took typing and stenography, I thought this might help me and maybe my job won't be so Random.

So if somebody, you know, in the upper floors above sea level, needed some help for a day or however, long they would call down to the trenches, you know, where I was. So I got there on Monday and by Wednesday or A call came in. It was sort of like I could imagine Little Orphan Annie at the or any orphanage, where a call comes in and they pick you. So they call came in that one of the executives and the personal trusts of department on the 12th floor. He was a senior vice president of the bank. Secretary was unexpectedly out birth.And they needed a fill-in. So they selected me know if I went and I walked in and you could hear a pin drop in this place. I could tell it was going to be. I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you know lightheartedness you know it was almost as though they should have had a font of holy water and you should genuflect. You don't need to sit down at your desk so where I am andIt turned out that his secretary all fast forward a little, so here I wasn't, you know, my skills are good. I am answering the phone and taking shorthand letters, things are getting things are humming along, everything is great, and it turns out that she, the secretary who am, I was replacing was not coming back. She was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications. So, the, the absence was going to be long-term and they hired me.So now and I had a raise right away, I thought this work life is a cinch. I'm here for a week and I got a raise wage out of the sub-basement, you know, I'm in the light of day things were, you know, like things moving along so quickly that I, I figured, I was going to have some meteoric, rise down, Wall Street, you know, a trajectory I was so one day I was there, I was there for about three months, I guess, and I was out to lunch, still trying to, you know, explore the area. It's a exciting place. You know, Wall Street, and I found the New York Stock Exchange and I, you know, I was sort of like a pseudo tourist. So I was walking a Broadway one day. And I encounter the Marine Midland Bank, a very modern glass structure with this large orange Cube. Huge went up a few stories and I thought this looks like a much wage.More light-hearted place to work than the Irving could just see you know, is a great place light and Airy. Modern I went in and I asked the security guard where the Personnel Department wage. So I was directed there, I sat down, filled out an application and I was drunk with power by then, you know, because I had gotten raised things were moving along quickly. So, I filled out the application, the interview with the Personnel manager, went very well. She told me about three different types of positions, I could have and wage visited. All three of them and I could pick whichever one I wanted. So, I picked the one in the international Department that sounded really interesting to me."

I had a boyfriend, I didn't want to move to Paris and many people probably would have said Paris, you know, and like would have been home. I look back, I probably made the wrong choice but because the romance didn't work out either, but that's okay.

So it's trauma event where my grandfather passed away and he was not sick. He went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work. I went off on a normal day and I remember playing you know with my friends and the Beautiful summer time just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital and a half of mine and I may put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with death. So it's kind of a sad story but I just read the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the the cycle of birth and death and whatnot. So it turned out that he passed away that night and I never did see him again and I was dead.Very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life and then looking back on it as an adult. Now, realizing that this man really was an angel of mine, I didn't realize it then but it came to believe. And I don't know if you want to know about my personal beliefs, but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that, there is still a connection, there came to learn about that and it just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways."

And we try to communicate as well invest as we can with asking her simple questions and she communicates in a sort of a roundabout way.She has three children and what she wants to talk about them. She can always get their name. But she'll say one, two or three, and that's how we know cuz she somehow she brings a lot of numbers. And when she tries to tell you she's in pain, she'll say a good hand. And she'll say one, two, three, four, five pain, I don't know, I don't know like that, she's somehow.

When I was a child and I was was the summer when I'm going into kindergarten, it was in July and it was just a normal day. I was a happy Carefree child playing with my friend, down the street and it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom you you went out the door off and came in for lunch and then you went out the door and they really weren't very many parameters. And there were lots of fun adventures to be had and came home to find out that he had had a. Then used the word change but that's what he had but he had to go to the hospital from work and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when Grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies. And the next morning, I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like. I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that he wasn't coming home and just as a child a ninjaChild kind of coming to terms with life-and-death, saying, wow, and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who was in the nursing home, she was around cuz she, she kind of lived with us for a while. And it was just, she actually, I remember she slapped me cuz I was crying. So hard. Everyone went to the adults. Went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that and I was hysterical crying. I was so sad and she didn't know what to do. So she actually slapped me to get me and it worked. She wasn't being mean off, but I was beyond being consoled at that point. And I felt very alone in my grief. For some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man as my grandfather, but I went off that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future. And I remember a time when I was in sixth grade and we were having a sleepover in my friend's birthday.Yard happened to be with a girl who lost her, dad in the Newark riots. A girl who lost her Young Brother to leukemia, the other girl had lost her. Grandmother and I had lost my grandfather, and we, it was like they, they could make a movie about the bond, we were all in the tent, and we were just talking, and I can see us all sitting there. And we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there, it was probably the safest place to ever let it go. And we all just, just let it out and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this and it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life. You know, as I grew up and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didn't know about angels then but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe and he can sort of Watch Over Me If You Will."

The most memorable, they was the day, our son was born, but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how how interesting they have all was, we were students at Montclair State and in those days, a freshman still had to wear beanies and wear a sign around her neck and get certain signatures, and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus. We had to sing the alma mater off, but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at said, life Hall and he noticed the sign and said something about, I think I had part of it was covered and he said, are you a speech major in English? And I unveiled the words English but he was a senior and I was a freshman and so I got to meet one of the you know the upper class and got his signature off. And then later we just have it was an easy conversation. We just we talked a little he continued when I whenever I saw him to say hi and and people were telling me he's a BM.See, you know, he's he was a vice president of student government and I said, oh my goodness, but the more we had to talk about I was a student leader in my high school. And I thought when he, when the phone call first came to town, it was to work on a committee returned out that he when he was interested. So our first date I think was the something like the Kingston Trio or something like that. Some folk group it was really thought they were on campus and join, probably arrange for them to come. That was one of his duties, but want to just think of how all that unfolded. Just I knew I was going to finish school and so we we pasted ourselves, I guess. You know, to be logical about things, get to know each other no surprises along the way because you have time with the person and you, you see, all the seasons and all, but I think when it finally came to to getting married, I don't think there was a formal people asked us, but this was not even a formal proposal. I think everyone around us assumed, we were dead.Married. So we got and so I wasn't engaged. You know, I was pinned. And someone said to me, the next thing you know you're you're engaged to be engaged. I said I thought. Well that's what that means. I said Oh I thought it meant sort of going steady college-style. So now you're engaged to be engaged and said, well, make some time to go versus Indians. What it means to be a visual couple too. So I tried to assert myself, but I guess you might have been right. But I don't care anything but that when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross, probably, most important thing that happened was college and Joe, and getting married and all that happened at once at all converged."

I was tired, and you didn't think much of it took. Then I noticed that I was losing weight and that's what caused me to seek a doctor. So I went to, I had been to a doctor in years so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now both are physician for both of us.She did a an office exam and it was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram she palpated and she felt something wrong with lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram and that was positive enough for me to have a CAT scan and a pet scan that led to the need for a biopsy. So at that by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong.The decision was going to be, is it? It was lymphoma, but is it going to be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma? So I went to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy, but that wasn't enough. Not enough tissue is obtained. So I had to go into the city into New York to Sloan for our more complete biopsy and that clinched it, it was Hodgkin's lymphomaWhich in the great scheme of things was the better of the two Hodgkin's as much more treatable, a higher success rate. So I started chemo. And after the first session, I developed a rash and we weren't quite sure what was going on. One of the nurses that the oncologist wasn't sure. And he was going to proceed with the treatment for the, for the Hodgkins. Wage, one of his nurses said, this is an allergic reaction.And it turned out, it was a severe allergic reaction to allopurinol. I think I mentioned this last time, which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout. But it has a protective effect for kidney function. That landed me in the hospital with with what's called Steven Johnson syndrome, which is treated like a burn people with Stevens-Johnson are often sent to burn units, my mouth was inflamed. It was just all I couldn't find order it burned. That of course, suspended chemo.We work through the Stevens-Johnson. I was looking forward to keep it was, it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation home. So and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather, but still I, I couldn't take solid food for for two weeks or so home, nor water. It was it was the only thing that really worked was, was Ice-TSo, I got through this season Johnson, went back to chemo and had chemo for several months that ended last May."

I took it once during the whole treatment time and and even then it wasn't because I was starting to to vondage. I just felt a bit queasy off. A lot of rest.

I I had I was a speech clinician doing work as a speech language pathologist, but I missed interacting with students, I had and and and I had some experience in doing that because I am by undergraduate degree was in history and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that. But then thinks things would have changed, obviously, but I missed that kind of interaction. I work mostly with children.When I was a speech clinician. And Marie was teaching English at the high school level and she would come back home with stories about you're working with students and discussion as they had in class, and I was sort of jealous of that. And so, when I was invited to do to become an instructor here, I jumped at the chance that that changed everything.And I was warned that from from Friends colleagues that I was taking a big risk in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure, that they were. I was going to be taken advantage of, I don't know where they got the idea, but that I would, you know, I would work for X number of years and I came time for tenure, I wouldn't get tenure but I wanted to be in the classroom so much that it was more that than doing research. Actually, it was actually teaching that Drew me to it that I said, heck with it, I'm going to do it. And so I I did and it got changed everything and that was a very very positive event.

She becomes essentially they're made and housekeeper and has to attend to their needs and the needs of the household and heavenly father was of no help in mediating off any of this. So the girl ends up being in the household but being rather, a member of the household being a servant. As I said, one day off a ball was announced. She lives in a, I guess a principality headed by royalty.And one day a ball was announced. If I recall correctly, it's because the prince is in need of finding a wife. His father's tells him that long time for him to marry. So a ball is organized and all of the eligible, young ladies in the principality are invited to attend college and the three step sisters, and their mother mother got a plan to go and they get their gowns ready. And Cinderella has to help them with that too often, but it turns out that she's not going to be allowed to go.She, of course, is very sad about that, but enter her fairy godmother, they go. They go to the ball, the the, the the step sisters and Thursday, after the ball, Fairy Godmother arrives on the scene and says, the Cinderella, you're going to go to, and we're going to get you there. By turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice and two Coachmen wage. And I guess the mice to become horses. I'm not sure which animals become a horse's, maybe the mice. She's outfitted Cinderella's outfitted, with a gown pair of glass slippers. Why glass? I don't know. But she's still, she has to go home by by midnight because at the stroke of twelve, everything's of a turn back to what was the coach will become a pumpkin, the culture, and become the mice. You should lose her. Beautiful clothing.So she goes to the ball promises to to leave by 12 but she's having a great time and the princess very much drawn to her and she should still dancing on the clock. Strikes, twelve but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time off, but she's running out one of her slippers slippers comes off, and the prince, picks it up, and it turns out thatShe is the one that he wants and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by sitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into this, into the glass. Slipper, a, a hunt is organized, so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households and the principality, and I guess, with his assistant, Josh asks, each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper and this deception sisters, of course, try and they don't fit and they try off the push. Their estate into that slipper and doesn't work and they're very upset. And lo and behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly with her slipper. And they're very, very surprised, shocked upset."

We went through a domestic adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birthmothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute. So that was kind of heartbreaking at the time. And then finally. Tim my daughter when she was about two months old so you know we always say we were just waiting for her and and of course she always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her and we didn't have any choice with him. He's just when we so, you know, I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because I gave birth.A child. And also I adopted a child. I think he gave me interesting insight to both sides of it. And they're certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well. But, you know, a lot of people say you should never adopt. It wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah. She's my child. Just like my son is, there's no difference between them so and she and she is interesting too because she says that she wants to adapt when she's ready to start a family that she would like to adopt a child from the Foster system. So I think that's kind of interesting her perspective on that.All right. Same idea, here. Take a look at these pictures. They also, tell story, I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And again, you can look up the pictures as you tell the story. Oh boy was playing soccer and his yard and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room, and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp.The dad stood up, got the ball and looked out the window and glared at his little boy. These pictures tell story take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. So the little boy, was getting ready to go to school and his mother said Johnny, you need to take an umbrella. It's going to rain today. And he said, Mom, it's not raining. I don't need an umbrella and he left, and she woke up. As he got halfway to school, it started raining. And then it started raining harder. So, he turned around, and he went back home and told his mom you were right, it started raining and she was not very happy with him. And so he ended up taking the umbrella in walking back to school. So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this sort of picture. And then tell me a story about what you see, ideally, a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay. So the little girl was riding along On her tricycle in her yard and she was playing with her cat and her dog. And all of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree and so she was very upset and she called for her dad and she said, Dad, Sparky is chased peanut up. Hey, and so the dad said, well, let me see if I can go get the cash. So Sparky's still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree. Dad climbed up the tree, but he couldn't reach the cat. The cat scared to death"

But I guess the scariest thing was they gave me the epidural and afterwards being paralyzed from the waist down, was quite an interesting feeling I should say and my son had to go into a special care Nursery. So he wasn't in my room with money and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the Special Care Nursery so that I could nurse him. So that was a rather scary kind of feeling when and I guess because I've worked with people with stroke and other neurological disorders that kind of gave me at least a little bit of a an inkling of what they go through and how they feel not being able to have some motor control. So luckily that only last month.For a few hours and then it wore off. But that was actually the first time I ever had to go into the hospital when I was in my thirties giving birth to my son. Have you found any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating before? Yes, tell me what the problems were and a little bit about what you did about it. Okay, well, I am the associate director of the Aphasia Lab at the University of South Carolina. So I work with people with Aphasia everyday and have been a speech pathologist for over thirty years, I guess, you could say. I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last thirty years of my working life. And what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people who are cognitively intact, but yet are not able to express themselves. So, I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach home.People who are basically trapped in in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So have just always been really interested in ways to change improve and of course with the last four years is when I've been at the Aphasia lab. So we focused on Aphasia and being able to number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication. But also I teach the adult language disorders, course here at University of South Carolina, as well, and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication supported conversation with family members, and just trying to improve in general, people's ability to communicate, no matter what their verbal communication is like. And then matter, whether cognitive skills are either, I have done research, both with people with stroke, but also with brain injury. So I'm working with people who lots of different levels of dead.Cognitive and language disorders. So just, I guess maximizing as much as we can ways for people to express themselves. Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life. It could be happy. It could be sad. It could be from when you were child, it could be from more recently. I guess it could be. So I have two children and one of my children is adopted and one is not. So I already told the story about my son being born, I guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption. We tried to have children for many years and couldn't get pregnant and we went through lots of fertility treatments and didn't they didn't really find anything that would cause as not to get pregnant, but I was bound and determined to be a mom."

Her stepsisters were very mean to her as was the stepmother took. So as they grew up, they asked to Darrell to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did. So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball berth.She was looking for princess and the step sisters were very excited about it and so was Cinderella but the stepmother and stepsisters said, oh well you could go to the ball because you have nothing to wear and so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years and a beautiful dress. And she was so excited, because now she'd be able to go to the ball and win her step-sister, saw it? They tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to a room and cried and the stepsisters went off to the ball and Along Came Cinderella's, fairy godmother. And she said, oh well you can go to the ball and she turn the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice and two dead.The porters and Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball.

And later that week, the prince wanted to find a beautiful woman who had danced with throughout the evening and he took the glass slipper that he found on the stairs and went around to every single woman in the village to see if he could find who it belong to. So the statistic mother locked Cinderella, and her attic room because she had a feeling that that was her.

And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my Master's in met. My husband got married had children that kind of thing, but it's always been something I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full-time professor and did some, a lot of international work that way.

I could think of another surgery that I had when I was younger was a, when I was a teenager, I am getting my wisdom teeth taken out, and I think a lot of people probably have had that that done as a, I'm telling you my dog does. I know that messes at the transcriptions off. Don't worry. So, but anyway, what someone I was sixteen. I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again, I'd never really had to have any any anesthesia or anything like that off. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course, it was an outpatient situation but since a lot of my friends had had it done before kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then, because I know now people that videotape people coming out of the anesthesia, but I do remember, it was such a strange feeling since I had never had anesthesia before birth.So it was kind of interesting and I just remember being having the cotton all in my mouth when when I was trying to talk and it was rather painful, I remember that too and then having just took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had I know from last week that they you do in fact have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. So again just share what problems that you've experienced with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help. Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research. It's been real interesting to me.Having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on a telephone call, or a video conference call with someone who has Aphasia. I'm surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this, but I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate, make sure that I ask questions, yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman who is actually in in Mexico. They went on a trip to Mexico before the quarantine and I'm actually kind of got stuck down there because I don't want to put her on a plane. And so anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit and we were talking about her possible doing one of our studies. So it was it was a challenge to help because she did have some, some probably moderate Aphasia and her son was on the phone too. So I was on the speaker phone so just that whole thing off,Really slowing everything down asking your question, several times, and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that was definitely definitely makes you think about those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants, who have Aphasia and I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one-on-one communication, with jokes, Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad from when you were a child or more recently? Again, you can change the same story is last week or you can choose a different story. All different story. I've lots of stores.

And so she ran away from the prince leaving a glass slipper on the steps, she made it home and everything turned back into the way it was before. And she was just happy that she had the experience that she had with the prince. And she also had the one glass slipper home the next day, the prince was trying to find the woman who had danced with. So, he went around to all the young women in the village to see who would fit into the glass slipper and wage.Evil stepsisters, tried and tried to get this little bird fit on their feet, but it wouldn't fit and they had lots Cinderella in the neck because they did not want her to see the prince, but her animal friends helped her get out of the attic, and she came down and it turned out that the glass slipper did fit her. So she took off with the prince and married, The Prince and lived happily ever after. Just tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. So first, I would get some bread and get the peanut butter and get the Jelly. And on a plate, I would put one slice of bread and spread some peanut butter on that slice of bread, get the other slice of bread and spread some jelly on that slice of bread. And then I would put it together and then eat it."

She forgets what you've asked? So we have the metaphor, I always use is that she like a sort of, if you sure a stack of pictures, she will look through it endlessly and make relatively the same comments on each picture, as you go off, until you stop her. And so, typically conversations with her aren't exactly conversations, they are redirections. I would say, I I tried to prompt her to speak about something she does remember and when she goes off we just let her follow her thoughts, wherever they go and birth.She gets into a kind of sad place, then I try to redirect by pointing something out that distracts. Her like, is that a bird out the window? And she'll begin some place else. So it's a, it's not frustrating for her because I don't think she knows. I don't think she knows that she has this incapacity, I guess it is. So she's always in the moment. So I have learned that conversation with her is just about sort of keeping her mood, where it is so long. It doesn't feel like a conversation but it's a nice, but we clearly get to spend time together. It is harder. I have learned via FaceTime when you can't physically touch her or anything to kind of redirect her she gets kind of she wanders off and then she forgets that she's talking to you. But anyway, so there you go. There's a story."

I mean, no AP classes, no Advanced anything. And so when I got to college, it was a revelation that here, all of these people, my age who were similarly interested in reading and in books, and, and travel, and things that most of my friends from high school were not particularly interested in. And I think I remain to this day, the only woman for my high school to ever get a doctorate. So I am very thankful to my college for a providing that new community for me. And so that's one of the reasons I continue to contribute as a volunteer.

You only got 40% of your money back. So I found somebody who was going to return tickets work the next day and I said look, they're going to Discount 60% off, that's a plus right.

It's like the process was long because they did not diagnose the cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time, they were trying to figure out what was wrong and then I removed my family changing the position. And then this position who saw me for the first time says, we need to, we need to take out his tonsils, right away. And so I was bedridden, I had to stay in bed, but the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to show that I could do it in a project, the doctor's orders.

I was teaching, Spanish fluent in Spanish and I was teaching Spanish at Salve, Regina University in Newport Rhode Island. And one of the students in my class would completely refused to do anything, you would not answer questions, you would not respond, would not participate. He was excluding himself from classroom, every class, every class. So eventually I said, okay, I have a problem here. I try different things to, you know, make making him the silent participant in in place or kids that we walk in class. And even that meant met with very partial cooperation. And so, I call them to meeting and then he told me a very long story e.How his parents that spent so much money tutoring him, or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through High School in math. In English. A can't just a version towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish. The reason why he was not participating, he could have been just making it up, but I think he was at least he made the effort of coming to the meeting to explain to me why he was not participate. I took that as a positive move a part."

The last prompts that we have, just tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, even though it, all right, just peanut butter. But if you were to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, first thing I would do is just a plate in a knife, and then I would go get some peanut butter and two slices of bread, and a jar of jelly.My first thing I would do is I would take peanut butter and I would spread it on one of the pieces of bread. Just on one side at one piece of bread, that I would get the Jelly and I would spread it on one side of the other piece of bread. And when I had them both completed, put them together. And that's the peanut butter jelly sandwich, but then you have to cut it in quarters because that makes it so, you can handle it to eat it easier without getting messy now."

Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. So, that's great. Because that's what I'd like for you to do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situation, myself, okay, Bob, not, I'll just say a person or this person or the difficulty in trying to communicate with this person. Is that this person lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time.Conveying that in words and many times it turns into emotion or feeling and which, you know, can be anger frustration? Any of those sorts of things but that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated. But on the outside we have no idea because those words never came out. And so what I try to do is ask questions and see what kind of answers I can get to put together, what the problem is dead because it's much.Easier and my opinion to deal with. Those sorts of things as they come up rather than waiting until someone is like a powder keg, and just blows up. However, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate because then their problem is, why are you asking all these questions? And then it's sort of like, Then you back off and you give the time to to calm down. But then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because saying in this in this situation is a work environment and you I need answers and I need clear communication. So another thing that I have tried to do is I see one individual in our office who can communicate with this person and so ITake notes on how that person works with the other person and I also use that person occasionally to help me understand and get information as well. I won't say that it's successful all the time, but it is successful enough for me to get by. So asking questions, backing off as needed. Feeling out the situation and finding an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage thinking back. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand what you already talked about might also fit this, but if you could choose something different talk about, in this case, that would be great and it can be happy or sad. It can be from any point in your life from child to now. So do you need a few moments to think about what you, you know? Okay, yeah. And I Meet myself and he may, please tell me your story. Sure. It's one story but it has two parts The most important things to me are my two kids."

I wasn't nervous to have a baby except that, she came so fast and when I she came on her due date which is precisely who she is. And I got to the hospital and had was already off at like 8 or something. So, there were very few options for me, except to just have the baby and I did, and I just remember her coming out and looking like, a little Mirchi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And she was so Brown, her hair was so Brown, and she had this brown hair all over and I had light hair and her dad has light hair off. So it was just pretty incredible to see this this little baby with all this brown here. Anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just dead.It doesn't go away. I remember what I was wearing when I got there. I I remember where it was sitting in the car. I remember the stoplights we went through, I remember the path to the hospital, a everything about it and then bringing her home, Nothing Was the Same ever again. So it's like you, I remember every detail and then my whole world just you know that she was always there then and then it was like she was never not there and then her brotherI was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have Grace because she like I said, came so fast and when I got to the hospital, there was nothing to do except have this baby suck. And so, when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember my gynecologist, like, you know, you had a very quick first born, this has happen again and I sat I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks in all I could think was. When is this going to happen? When is that terrible horrible pain going to come back? And that's not how it worked at all. Actually IHe was also born on his due date. So now we've determined, it's me. Who has to have things in the right place, but we wrote to the hospital, I checked myself in it was said it was the exact opposite and He came out with this white hair, the golden kind of face. And I just remember thinking, you know, there are so many times when people say, you know, no two kids are alike or boy, girl, two boys, two girls, doesn't matter. Like they were completely different, they are still completely different, but they are a best things I have. Like, I look at my life andThat's it, it's them.

And when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, I remember feeling a lump under my left arm pits, my left side, and it was in a really funny location. So I was sort of surprised that I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound and I took my friend Dorothy with me off and the oncologist who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with Stage.Insert. So I called my sister who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff, but she lives in Chicago. So she wasn't going to let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington. So, I went to Chicago to Northwestern for what seemed like that entire summer. May June July V, many months to compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer and especially the first time they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they could choose the best course of treatment. Especially because I was forty, they view that as young and so it's pretty radical. So, anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months, and months of Agony. And then ultimately have aI have a bilateral lumpectomy so they found it in both sides actually after all the tests and that was removed, my surgeon at Northwestern was great. Very comforting and confident, which is what I needed, and then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So, my surgical oncologist was finished with me. After my surgery, the medical oncologist, then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation, and then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. So, after I had back surgery a week later, they put my port in and the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to God.the where they administer the, the drugs for chemo and I had treatment every other week for a couple of months and I recalls sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful and you can taste them, you can smell them. But in your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells there. They are doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that said, that's odd. I guess how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing being killed after my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation and off, that just made me tired, so that was okay. And then, that was right. I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6th, my radiation ended just after Christmas. So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments and that's what happened."

It's like he, at that time was able to to play off. Two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play, but he did it. And so it was really important for me because I just lived there. I just had my mom at home to see this real healthy dynamic between two people and everything was like, clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there. My Grandpa would have, he always had a page full of nuts, because there was a squirrel named Petey who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now I'm sure it wasn't just one p d. There were probably twenty pts but I thought it was PD and I just always called the pity and so he would feed PD and then we would go inside and my grandma would always have cooked something.Kind of dinner late afternoon ish dinner and it was always fancy like High Noon kind of dinner. And you know, I was always homemade and wonderful and she laid out the table. So beautifully and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that.

And I lived up on a mountain and I was taking a massage class Thai, massage past and I was on a motorbike and I was driving a motorbike and my boyfriend at the time was behind me and imagine I'm writing driving down the mountain and it's lots of Curves and like this, right? And he's behind me and knows that I need coffee. But for some reason thinks it's a good idea to hand me my coffee mug while I'm driving the motorbike. And I'm not thinking because it's morning and I need coffee and I go to grab the coffee mug. And next thing we know the, of course the motorbike went. Whoa! And then boom! I go on this. I didn't hit my head or anything. I mean, I had his helmet on, so, but I did fall on my shoulder very hard and broke my collarbone.So I got up off of the road and all of the local ties come running and they're checking on the motorbike to make sure that it worked. And I'm sitting on the side of the road going home is not right, this is not right my boyfriend at the time said, oh. Maybe you need to go to the hospital. And I said, I absolutely need to go to the hospital will get on the bike. I'll take you there. And I said, no, thank you. I'm never getting on that thing again. So I am charged. It hit your ride and the only car that it came along. That would give me a ride. Was a truck full of Thai, monks who can't sit next to a woman, even though this woman is injured. So I have to kind of sit in the front and away from this monk so that I don't touch him. And then, it's as I'm going down the mountain from side to side, I can feel is getting more and more painful. So then they drop me off at a, I try to tell them, we get down to the bottom of the mountain and you could go to the right to a sort of a country hospital or go to the left and go to the big city hospital. And I was trying to tell them and tie. Please turn this, please share in this way and telling them the name of the phone number.Hospital, Chang my room, check my room and they didn't take me there. They took me to the country hospital. So I go to the country hospital and no one knows what to do with this for years. And I'm sitting there looking and I can see like, morphine right there and like something I need something, but no one is helping me. And all these people just keep walking around in. So I just got up and walked out to the highway and I caught a taxi and I caught a taxi to the other Hospital in the which is a taxi. There is a pickup truck so you have to get into the back of the pickup truck and and the driver was a woman Taxi Driver which was really strange, cuz it Doesn't Really Happen all that money. And she was very kind and didn't even charge me because she knew that I was in pain. So then I go in the hospital and I go up to the counter and George.Is the regular part of the hospital? I didn't go in the emergency cuz I just wasn't thinking, I was just like this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English, I've been in an accident, I am hurt. I need help now and they hand me this form and tell me to fill it out and I have a broken bone. So I can't. So I'm like so I put it down. I put down the form and I walk over to the emergency and I immediately started crying my head off."

I'm going to eat lots of brownies to. That was a big mistake because I, I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time. And, and then my blood pressure went really long time. And like, towards the end of my pregnancy, ended up with toxemia. And so I realized it when I had woken up one morning with like a was probably Beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything. My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill him.And and I just might it was like a pulsating thing in my head and I went in and I had to the back to Clinic which was close to my house and I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often and it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in p and a cop, go get your blood pressure taken. Then you have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and and talk really fast and write everything down. Then he says, and then we'd have to wait an hour to get in there, right? Well, that day I came in, it's going to be in the cop and then went to go to take my blood pressure, and I'd have to sit at this machine off, and it takes your blood pressure and print it out and then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did. I didn't rent put it in there. Bring it out. I handed it to the nurse.And she was just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay so I do it again and it prints it out. It's just as high. So they're like so irritated with me by this point. Like what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in month and then the nurse use the professional, right? Does it and realizes holy crap. This woman's got like, really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away and they said we're checking you in right now. And so, because this is a serious and they checked. And they had, like, I don't know what is it, like, sugar or something, in my urine? And my, yeah. So there's all kinds of problems happening with me. I'm be notes to me. And so the dog,Send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet and after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down but then they said, well, it's your, we could send you home but, but we're not a higher percent, sure that you could control this. So we think we should induce cuz it was I was far enough alone and so it was a Tuesday morning and they said at 5:30 in the morning, we're going to bring you down to induce you off. And they, this is kind of gross, but they made me take a suppository. It was just really fun. Everything is clean and so, but the fun part was, was that it was in a room where there were other people"

Today will try again tomorrow. Tomorrow's Wednesday. So we go through the same thing again. We're not actually, I think I started a Monday. So as Monday, Tuesday and then Wednesday. So I was induced three days in a row And and it got like seemed to work less every single time like the the medicine or whatever it was and I tried to tell them I'm like, I'm not a doctor or anything, but I think you're only giving me the amount of medicine that you would for a small Japanese woman and I am not a small Japanese woman. So you need to give me more in order for this and do something to work off and they said no we're just going to on Thursday. Our plan is, we're just going to give you a cesarean and we're going to take the child out surgicallyAnd so the story doesn't end, so then they go and bring me in and of course, I'm completely naked. They why was they had a gallon on? But then of course they may take it off and that's pleasurable to be in a room full of people, completely naked and pregnant and foreign, and all of that stuff. And they had me lean naked on this woman who was a nurse I had to Lean Forward on her and they went to put this like shot in my back but then the doctor kept like not getting it.

So then they had me lay back in like this T fashion and put up a curtain and men are not allowed in the so the Hub app not allowed in there in Japan.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat and the cat was chased by a dog, and the cat ran up the tree and way out onto the same as the dog stood working there. And then she called her dad and he said, Daddy come and help me help me get my cat. So for next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the truck, you go part way up and then he got stuck and he could not get down and the cat wouldn't come down and somebody must have seen this and called the fire department off because finally they came with their ladders and they probably shoot away the dog and they put the ladder up against the tree. May help the father down and then I'm going to say the cat jumped down of his own free will. Industry."

Well, there was a period of time when I was approximately 48, forty nine, years old, when I began having a series of lung collapses dead and what a mysterious thing. This was but it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual. And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor and I was sent to the ER, for x-rays for this lung collapse.And it was never complete. It was only about fifteen to twenty percent of my there's always my right lung. And so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse and I spend some time trying to figure out what on Earth could this be. And finally, I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm. And at the start of each menstrual. I think it is Lady in breaking and bleeding into my pleural cavity because I have found 69 examples of I have, I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation and the doctor said, well, you might be right. We'll send you to a surgeon. So, I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do a degree. I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had Almanac to me and the doctor. Yep.Procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm but instead he cemented the top part of my life long to the cavity that holds it in place. So that the next time I would have a bleed into this area if that's what it was. In fact my life would not fall down and create a partial collapse So that's what happened. After that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened months, but I did not have a lung collapse month.So in the end, the surgeon said, well I guess that's that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis blood into the pleural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of what types such that. I would no longer have menstrual periods. And it all turned out happily ever after. I had no further lung collapses."

When he was, when he had big therapy that commutes go patient services, one of the therapists, they're made him a communication book in which he could point to a picture and show me what he wanted. And that should have worked but it didn't he just didn't really want to use it. So now we have lived together for about two and half years without hardly anyVocal communication from jet other than what I told you. But I have sort of figured out what kid wants most of the time and I can usually ask him. Do you want eye drops? Do you want to face wash? Do you want you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you cold? You want a jacket off and you can tell me yes, or no. Recently we have tried something else called. Well, it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles and I put them into letter boxes for him to see if that might work. If he could make some words to show me what he wanted, and we have had a very limited success with that, but I would not say it's the Magic Bullet way. You can make a simple word if I asked him to such as she kind of sandwich, do you want cheese or bacon?Or. What do you want to drink? And he can write, he will sometimes write juice with the letter tiles. Only on two occasions that though has he been able to take the letter tiles? And tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out. So I don't know if we can make it work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it ten thousand times. but mostly it's justTed can indicate that he wants something and then I asked him. Do you need the urine off? Or do you want to take a nap? Or are you hungry? Is it. Are you telling me I should make supper and you can tell me. Yeah or no. So that's pretty much how we communicate."

And with that, I would rip the honey onto the bread, then I would fold it over in half and voila off. There is my sandwich."

The doctor said, I believe you have something growing on your ovary happy and he said, oh, it's probably just a cyst.So I said, what should we do about that? And he said, well, maybe we should remove it just to be sure that it's nothing more serious. Okay. And do surgery was scheduled and I told him I was working. The other nurses that I worked with I would have to have a little few days off. So I can have a surgery so I can have a little something or other on my ovary removed and they all said because most of the little, some things on people's ovaries and our experience were malignant tumorsSo I had the surgery and it turned out to be a simple cyst, but at the same time, the doctor removed my Fallopian tubes and he said, now, you will not have to worry about ovarian cancer, you're not going to get it in the future.

Can you tell me a story about something important thought happened to you and your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently.it was February 1978, it had been snowing all day and in fact, that was the year when we had the blizzard of 1978 And we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So, at noon on this day in February, when my husband came home from work where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church. He said, Carla come in the house. I want to tell you something, want to ask you something. I said, okay, so I followed him and taking off boots and coats and scarves. And mittens, he said, sit down for a minute. So I said, okay, I'm sitting, what do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for 3 years? Can you? I said, where's Kenya? He said it's on the equator where it's hot. No snow. I said gently and let's go.And so we did. He had received an invitation to come and work with the national Christian Council of Kenya in a family life, education program, where he would be responsible for setting up a Counseling Center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in Community Health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it. And so four months later, we had sold our house, our car, most of our home old possessions, with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend and our family of four. My husband Ted are two daughters, Michelle age, nine, and Cindy, aged 55. And I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, Pennsylvania, because we were doing this, even though we are Luther's in background, and he is a Lutheran pastor, we were invited to do this to a Mennonite Mission program, who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to a 10-day orientation. In the heart of Mennonite country and Akron, Pennsylvania, where we spent ten, marvellous days, getting to know God.The Mennonites and also a group of other people who are about to embark on Mennonite, sponsored Mission programs. And the name organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three-year period of high adventure for our family. One of the best times in our lives off, whenever you are, ready. Tell me the story. You see, from with the beginning a middle and an end.Well, in the beginning, a little boy is outside playing with a soccer ball. He gives it a good kick goes, boom. Through the picture window of a house inside out. There is a man sitting in his chair."

If it's his house will say it is. And he gets up and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out through the whole, of the broken window, and he sees the boy, and we don't have any more pictures here, but I think the little boy says, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. And it was well so much, the home of a neighbor, I'm so sorry. Sir, that I broke your window, but I will work for you to age to replace it and so, that's what he did. So, again, these panels have pictures, tell story, take a second to look them over, they go left to right, and then bottom and then lived right. Again, whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see it's a beginning, a middle and an end.The little boy has his backpack on and he's getting ready to go to school. And his mom says it's raining outside, or it's going to rain. And you better take an umbrella. And he said, look, this guy is completely clear. I don't want to take it umbrella, but I think you better. The weather report says it's going to rain But he won't do it. And so she said, all right but I have told you it's going to rain. So we'll is it a little boy on his way to school and sure enough, pretty soon. It starts raining a drip and then he, he keeps on he's he starts to continue but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now and he's totally upset. And he runs back home drip-drip-drip on the kitchen floor. And his mother says, I told you and he said, well, you are right. I do need an umbrella at this time, he was willing to take the umbrella, he put it up and off. He went in the rain on his way to school.All right, so this first Picture Tells a Story, take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story. You see with the beginning a middle and an end with this, is the story of a little girl, who has a cat in one day. The dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat out of the tree and they're the cats at and would not come down. And as you can see, from the picture, the dog is still barking. So, of course, the cat isn't going to come down, and she probably cried and cried. And, finally, her father came out. And what's the matter? Kitty cat is up in the tree and the dog is still barking. So, the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat off and so he did. But the dog is still barking would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get they can't get as far out as the cat is dead.If he did, he would surely break the limb, and he would walk. So, as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening and she called the fire department. And so here comes the fire department, they are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man. And then after they do that the cat is still up in the tree but there's there's no longer barking. So the cat jumps down the end."

And of course they decided that it was too serious for them to deal with. So they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face. However, there had been a car accident somewhere else is, so this plastic had to be a pediatric plastic surgery. My son was only five. So those plastic surgery was off somewhere else.Dealing with people from the car accident.

This, this is all my son rumors, this huge, long needle, and it's just sizes face, and when they got the needle out, he's, of course, starts screaming, because it was a very long needle. And I, for some reason, the doctor told me that I'm you needed to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia. And so, I held him down and they've given the shot and then I stood up and since I hadn't eaten for eight, nine hours and I'm diabetic, I passed out on the floor of the operating room and a, then they had to patience to deal withAnd I am strange, but they just brought me some orange juice and, and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery.

We had waited was food and booze, but it probably went to sleep at 1 and then woke up at about 5 and went up to the top of the bone. The cabins are down below on the two holes. There's just like dining room cabin area and the big outside area, and then you will go up this kind of spiral staircase up to the very top where the wheel is and the controls for the same.Although it wasn't much wind and we're crossing the gun across the gulf stream's and we were just motoring across it wasn't good night for so long. But I got up there and the two people that were their legs went to sleep and the other person who's supposed to people and Chef the other person never woke up. So I just up there just modem across the Gulf Stream and so the current was coming from Long Way in a way. Wasn't much weights, it when really? But it was a full moon.And so the full moon was setting in the direction of going to still go and East-West and full moon was just slowly setting in terms of water and gradually to start to be lands showing. So the moon was setting and then the sun started coming up off. And when the sun came up, it only lit up the tops of the buildings along that for miles and miles of development on on Fort Lauderdale area. So because of the curvature of the Earth, the tops of the buildings are popping up slowly popping up being lit up by the by the Golden Light Of The Morning Sun.And we're still twenty miles away and buildings, were getting bigger, they're getting more of them soon. You could see that everything you could see on the shore was was buildings. And I thought I was looking around for commercial shipping and things like that, but I suddenly heard this noise like a learned, what is this? And I'm looking around and then, like, right next to us was a two-hole inflatable craft with three big outboard engines on the back and a small cabin and several armed men in the unicorn, and it was the Coast Guard.And they said the estimate to stop and permission to board, or I don't know if it's permission. Exactly. So sure. Exactly stopped about. And of course, there's no breaks. The boat. They'd cover came on board and looking at that me. And that's starting asking questions which are as answering. And then by this time, people heard, and we're getting up some package for starting to show up on deck and starts asking for the captain captain, Robbie with his dreadlocks and I'm asking about our itinerary and what our plans were, and once everybody's passports, and and then they, one of the guys in the coastguard. I'm just looking around on the boat and just like opening hatches looking around and looking into one cabin, where somebody hadn't come out yet walking in places just looking around, just the consumer.

And after ten minutes they left, and we continued on to Fort Lauderdale and went back to where we rented the boat and got out all the incredible amount of weight, too much food, and booze, and wine, and beer, and everything else we had. And thenwe all went back by car, back to the airport and flew home and We still never checked in with Customs US Customs. So I kind of worried about that. Like next time I went anywhere.

The peanut butter on one of the slice of toast after getting out of the toaster, just out of order, like most recipes, like, what was I supposed to do? When I do that?

So the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teachers, check me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer. And he said he was going to pull it out and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital and they had to remove my fingernail and sliced. My finger open, take out the needle and then x-ray because they had little splinters birth.Madeline their x-ray, that and then so it back up and I had a huge band-aid and unfortunately, like two days later, it would still a little middle, school dance.

But I am curious how long have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad it can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? Okay, great. So in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did to them.Did about it, if anything. I was special needs teacher for ten years and still go. So does Beka for that matter. Still go to Eagle Eyrie once a year with them. And there are usually 7 to 8 that go and we chaperone and they have classes. But three of them are brothers, of which only one she can speak the others, you have to follow their hand communication, it's not that they sign language, but they try to page cuz it's more in the grunting aspect of interesting enough usually hurt. His mom knows what he's referring to home.So I would say it's more being patient and they eventually get their story out by pointing them by doing the same thing over or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you when I think that is probably my nephew is autistic and non-verbal and pretty much it's the same thing.

It could be from childhood up to now could be happy sad. Just some important event that you could tell me a story about. I'm to think about it. There's no rush. Okay. Okay, here we go. Well, when I was young, I speculate, I should know. But I speculate, I was about eight years and my friend. Didn't I back in those days? You could walk the neighborhood, she lived a pretty good ways, but it was still a neighborhood and she was off on her bike and I was walking behind her. And then she decided it would get us to her house faster if I rode on the back of the seat with her home. So I hopped on the seat and she started pedaling, but my foot, my heel got caught in the spokes of the wheel as the wheel was spinning and almost cut my heel off. So she wrote ahead to her house.And I was walking as she had gone on to her house. I was walking and all the cars that were passing thought I was crying because she had stolen my bike. So I finally said nobody stopped to help me. But finally got to her house and her parents weren't home. So we called my mom and my grandmother was there too long and they came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. And in the waiting room, a man came up to me to show me that his head, had a fishing hook in it, and that mine was worse than his and I should be proud. But I remembered this old man with a fishing hook hanging out of his head. So I got stitched up and I was fine.Like you? Look at all these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Looks like there's a little boy who's just hanging out by himself playing soccer. When that call accidentally goes through the middle of that window. While the guy is sitting there watching TV, probably he looks a little shocked and he takes the soccer ball andKeeps it. So again here is a series of pictures. I'd like you to look at all of them first, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. I'm going to take this up as I go. it looks to me like Mom is offering an umbrella in his hand is say"

Then tell me a story about what you see and I'd like the story to have a beginning a middle and an end.Well, it looks to me like this little girl's cat, climbed up a tree and got stuck there. Or she just wanted to hang out there. And I would say, the next thing that happened was Dad tried to get up the tree to rescue the cat. And by the looks of his face, he looks stuck as well. The dog doesn't seem any please need to, please that he's up a tree and it looks like someone had to call the fire department to get the ladder to get the cat and Dad down.And there's my little got a little gasket you know the names a little. It would you like to see any of those pictures again? I don't think so. Okay, let me stop sharing, give it back over to you. Okay, so at this time, I'd like you to tell me as much as you remember about the story of Cinderella, using any details that you already need. You have step mother with her two girls and then Cinderella and her father dead. I guess something happened to him. That one, I don't remember, but Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters song sisters are jealous of her. And let's see, incomes Cinderella spent a lot of time by herself."

Yes, then pulled out the trunk and found the book and made address and the stepsisters ripped it all up. I took And I believe let's see then the Fairy Godmother gets in there and whips her up address with her magic wand and then removed her that she has to be that home by midnight. And let's see. She got to having a good time dancing at that ball and so I got off the midnight running down the steps. She lost the glass one at the glass slippers. She got home and saw her one glass slipper and Prince was Preity upset that his lover, his pride and joy had disappeared. So he did find the glass slipper on the stair. And he had his guys go through out the kingdom to see who this little slipper fit. And I remember in the movie, The step sisters tried to putThat on and even we're cutting off their toes, can make it fit. And oh, yeah, she had gotten locked in there, the little mice. Let her out of the room because when they came, they didn't watch a relish slipping out. Yes, she was able to put all the slipper and she lived happily ever after with a little knife. For your first prompt. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. First, I would probably go to the store and buy peanut butter and jelly because I do not keep that key or nor do I usually keep bread. So, I would go to the store. Buy all of those ingredients. Preferably a bag of potato chips, too. Because I do like to put potato chips in my peanut butter and jelly. So then I would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread. I do like my peanut butter first. So I would pull out a knife and I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread. And then I would get my strawberry jam cuz I'm not a pond a break jelly. So I would get my strawberry and I would put it on the right side and then I would open my bag of chips, I would log.Start some chips into the middle as well as put some on the side of the plate. Close it up, probably cut it in half and then"

All right, so last time I'm going to tell you will see last time we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel, almost off on the bicycle rack. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult. So I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother, I have an older brother and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then. And the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get the to the topic, a wheel wheel chair. I've got wheelchair my brain to get to the top of a tool shed, so I followed to keep up with him and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed, but I was pretty scraped up from that. And I decided I didn't likeFollowing state with the shimmying up a tree so they should be down. I was not going to shimmy down. So my brother little wage charge, he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and tried to call. Mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff. But no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast so you had to stay prompt for a little bit, but mine is that it was a Walking Dead cast.I was fine. That's what I remember of that. So my next question is have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad any type of difficulty communicating but what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues or did. I'm going to have to tell the same story. So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church where I was there. Sunday school teacher for ten years and still go to Eagle Eyrie with them for special needs Retreat. It's a group of about five to six hundred special needs. Most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities which includes like the big square dance. So you just help them whether it's wheelchair wage.Bound or whether they have a hard time walking. But most of the time there is a speech problem, and you just walk, sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard to them to communicate. And here over top of it, the three boys that I spoke of last were off Brothers of which only one and communicate. I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two gel, it's a series of grunts some sign language over the years. I've, of course, learned off the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. We have her wedding ring upstairs, he brings money in his own pocket, that's his Dowry, so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate, but through his sign is just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying his his dog.Mr. And his mom usually knows that they are communicators but it's just their communicators for them. Put it that way, they will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer. And by facial expressions, you know,"

This can be a happy story, sad from anytime childhood up until more recently. Just something that happened that you could tell me a story about and you can take time to think if you might want to say. Cuz I'm going to try not to tell you the same story. Those were to injury stories last name important as soon as I hang up from you all go, why do you like tell her, what is important?like, you know, I think one of the most recent things Is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries or like stopping moment. Since I have when that hits January and she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth that I you tell me that went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so andOh my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that I'm not sure who was going to bring her. I called her on a Friday, after I got off of work in a quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu too. I guess Jackie was still there at that point in Mark. And when I called her she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the, ER, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get rid of intravenous. Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth. If that didn't make her feel better well,She did get the bone broth and it did not. And Mark did take her to the, ER, they did release her. It wasn't long after that, I you then found stuff that you've said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying and then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know that they need. So it was the decision whether to hop a plane that night and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie, it was Jack because Jackie drove her to the airport. And picked me up the next day off and we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was a chauffeur for the entire time. We were in the doctor's office and he admitted her into the hospital for that night andThe surgery was the following night. I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night which I was glad that I did because she was with it, but not really with it. But staying there with her off for a few days afterwards, she was a trooper, but none of my children have really been sick so to be so far away and not be able to be there immediately. So I'll turned out good but as you know, there's still issues."

I am wonderful. Now, I'd like you to take a look at this series of pictures, they tell a story and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning, there is a young, lad outside playing soccer laying around, looks like by himself. Middle of the story is the soccer ball goes through the window into the the family room of a neighbor to neighbor who was very surprised. And the story is wage. Once again, the neighbor decides to keep the ball and does not go after the little boy again. So, here are some more pictures that tell a story. Please. Take a look at both of them and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.The beginning of the story, the little boy is heading out to school, or see a backpack, on his back. And Mom hands him an umbrella to let him know that it's getting ready to rain, will be range are during the day. I assume he attended class and was walking home. Middle of the story is in the way home. He gets stretched. It starts raining and he is soaking wet. End of the story is he's a little perturbed bad, his mom was correct. And moral of the story at the end is he took his umbrella with him? Next time he went out I'd like you to look at everything that's happening. And then tell me a story about what you see and I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end zone. I would say the beginning of the story is the little girl was out riding her bicycle when she happened to notice that her cat climbed a tree and had gotten stuck.Middle of the story. I would say Dad came up and decided he was going to try to help out the kitty cat and he is well got stuck back, end of the story would be the fire department was called to come rescue. Both of them.

Those daughters were very jealous of Cinderella Cinderella was beautiful and they made her become their servant and served them food and T and take care of them. She had to beat the tapestries. She had to make the meals, she had to do everything for them. Then Along Came the invitation to the ball. She knew that that Palace was nearby. And that she would be, she thought she was going to be invited. So she pulled out her book on how to make a gal. And she made a beautiful gown for herself up, which the sisters were not going to allow her to attend. Yep.And they tore up her dress. So, the Fairy Godmother decided that she would give Cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball so I believe it was a pumpkin that turned off coach. I believe that Gustafsson friends became the horses and she took the carriage. Oh, Fairy Godmother gave her address as well with her hair. Probably her nails and toes too. So, but she told her, you only have until midnight. So she attended the ball. The prince was, I got over her and they danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight. She realized how dangerously close she was and she ran down the stairs of the palace off and lost one slipper.She got back everything turned back to normal, the pumpkin in the mice. And I think stepmom got suspicious about who that was a child of. The prince had fallen in love with and laughter in a room. But just got some friends were able to get her the key she got out. So when the palace guards came, a-callin home, she was able to try all the slipper and they realized that it was her. I'll skip the part about cutting off the toes this time and all this stuff they did just step up the step daughters. So, okay, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich song. I would get out two pieces of bread, I would get out my peanut butter and I would get out my jelly and yes, it does have to be strawberry jelly song.And I would get my knife out of the drawer, I would spread the peanut butter on one side, trying not to tear my bread, minor on the peanut butter, not too much on the other side of the bread, which I think I said last week, you have to have one on one side, one on the other side, and I would spread my strawberry Jell-O sugar-free strawberry jelly. And I would spread that on the other side, I would get my Lay's potato chips because you cannot do peanut butter and jelly without Lay's potato chips off. I would pour some on the plate. I would put some inside the sandwich. I would put one slice of bread on the other slice of bread. I would cut sandwich into halves. And in."

Like and it doesn't ever resolve itself. Now I'm, you know, still still have the morphine in my system but yet I remember this and I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know to do cuz I was remembering with the nurse said that I you know, twenty-four hours and it was kind of like it did concern me the night before so I was like I don't know I don't know any well Bridget he said you suck to see everybody else on the floor so you think about it and by the time I come back here you have to have a decision.So I was like so I was like but I may never get he was well it's 50-50, doesn't happen.

And I was like fighting to stay in a way because I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school at high school and I wanted to tell him, Bruce, do not let him give me the second block, which eventually Bruce appeared. I told him that I told him everything I just told you, I'm like, I don't want the block mean while I was at a, my mind and pain, there's a wonderful male nurse, he kept me there till like, 4:00 that afternoon.

So he went for the, he said him to the audiologist and took the audiologist was in this little glass room with, you know, stuffed animals that moved and cymbals and drums and the whole hearing test. So, Ryan a set in my lap and we faced her like this and she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass. Because before she moved the drums, she he was so smart. She looked at the drums, and then she looked at him and then she moved the drums and then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey ass bowl and she looked at him so she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway,The ENT and I get into it. In a big loud way because I keep he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him, his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests anyway, we go through. So, finally finally, he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with this speech language pathologist he was two point eight. I think at that time that fall I'll never forget the first session medicine. I was like, this is never going to work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early thirties. She looked like Cinderella blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate. Every single word in my life, the way she did. Anyway. Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She walked him to the verge of tears. Every sessions we were private-pay, she worked him for those forty-five minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated goingShe didn't let him manipulate the session and she worked wonders, and we ate drank and slept long letters. And sounds that sheep in the Jeep book. Alphabet cereal, alphabet pasta. It was like crazy town. So we did that with private pay with her. And then at three years old, the town would pick him up. So I thought was a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that sop. It's just in case with funding and Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use. I can't would be not ready for me to take your money and where he was initially thought she met him consultation. He was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder, which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point and then when she, you know, when she dismissed him, you're good, he's all good to go home.Is felt paranoid. She's the only thing is fifty percent of the children with this diagnosis. The the way they're taught traditionally taught how to read in public schools. They're not able to learn how to read that way. So you met at that point, you know, half so I don't know what go to private school. Get another. I didn't know what we were going to do medicine but I was like wow. So anyway we definitely rolled over 23. He met a nice young SLP who I just graduated medicine she was lovely month. So sweet, he manipulated her, he ruled the sessionsIt was game on every time we went in there. She was so sweet. She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave he would look at me and smile. Oh my gosh, it was terrible and awful and she went off to, I don't know where and then he got a experienced older woman who again, cracked the whip with him, Tracy o'gara,"

This really, really, I mean woman who had these really really terrible daughters and so they all move in together and I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean, woman wouldn't be marrying him but when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really, really meets. And really so Cinderella is May, she's made toClean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do. And so she's pretty much a slave again. I don't know where the day is doing all this. But so she works for a long time because in the story, it showed her as a little girl and then later on, it's like eight years later. So, apparently, this happened for a long time. This girl's going to need some help so she is still working for the family and then she I don't know. Has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time and then there's that cast off and she's like oh weird other people live who I'm sure have a great life. SoThen there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince, so, he can find a wife. I don't know, this sounds very crazy as I'm saying it, but it's true. So they had this day at so that prints can find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently, again, her family is not available off because they didn't invite the servants. But her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come, but she thinks she's going to come. So she gets to try on the outfit and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that. Helped her get ready. And then, the step sisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book, they take the necklace off in Terror address and all this other stuff. I've just think that's a little bit over-the-top but they do when they're really mean and so she has to stay home. Well, I guess you'd probably cries or something happens that caused birth.The Fairy Godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubbed the lamp in there, it's maybe she read a book. I don't, I don't remember the part. But anyway, she has this Fairy Godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So, she asked her fairy godmother, I guess to go to the dance. I would probably just asked to move somewhere else. Like this is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that like one night is going to help but anyway, so I want to go to the bank. So the Fairy Godmother like gets all her stuff gets her all, gussied up, and then put certain pumpkins inch away. So she gets to go dance. And it looks like she had a nose job. If you look back and book, her nose is much much smaller in her hair as much, much longer when she goes to the bank. So something happens and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance and the low and mold principal a letter. And so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off.Off last year's. Anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I've probably had taken him off 15 minutes after getting there, so she lost her shoe and then all, the prince knows, is that girl. He loves War this shoe. So He sends his lanky guy out to all the people that he invited to the parties, figure out who fit in his shoe. And It's hard to believe that. Nobody else is foot within this year."

Apparently, just one day, I don't do not like pay it was she got really pretty all in one day. So the mirror says that Snow White is the prettiest. And so the dog eating wizard S, I don't know what she is. Anyway, she wants to get rid of Snow White, soShe puts like a ban on Yonder it, or something like that. I don't know where she lived in the first place. Like, I don't know if she lives there or if she just lives in the town home or what, but she's mad at her and she wants to go by. So Snow White knows that she has to run away I guess or hide or something. But anyway, there's this guy who's kind of like The Lumberjack e sort of and he shows up to the queen because he needs money and he said, yeah, I'll go killer. And so he goes and he thought, but then when he gets there she's like really super nice and he feels bad and so he doesn't kill her. But he's like, hey, this lady. She's really try and take you out. So you got to get out of here. So she like runs and force and stuff off. Oh, yeah. For all of this, she wants to marry the prince, but I don't know how she met the prince. So, I don't know whether she saw a picture of him or whatever, but she likes his friends dead.Maybe the old lady is like a cougar and she likes the prints to maybe the prices are son. And she doesn't think that snow was good enough. I have no idea, but there is a prince and she likes this friends or she dreams of or whatever. So anyway back to The Lumberjack, he tells her to get out of here and she runs off in the woods and the woods are really really scary and stuff and she runs for a long time and then it's sort of like three bears where she comes in this house and she looked really tired, and she's probably tries all these bits. But anyway, we only see you're in one of the beds in the picture and she is sleeping, well while she's sleeping. The people that own the house come in and Thursday are 7, weird, little dwarf e-men and apparently she does not think this is creepy. She thinks this is okay, and she becomes friends with them. And they are pumped, have her staying with them, which obviously they would. She's the fairest in the land. So I don't know what she does there, maybe she cleans. I know that they also was a while they work and I theme.That they work in Coleman or something like that. And actually this, I hope this doesn't, this is us. And the side here to the story, when I was little, I had this record that money to put on for me all the time and they used to laugh because I'd stand in my crib and I would seem to dig dig song, but it was just me go over the crib thing. And so I told that Beijing could tell an atom and sour once in a while when I'm working. Oh God. So anyway, I know that they dig from the records, but I don't really know what they dig a whistle when they get something happens. Oh, that really main Which lady makes herself like, even more of an age in whichAnd she comes up to Snow White and I guess, she's like, I'm not like roaming Farmers Market, lady or something like that. She's like, I have apples. And so I'd like, ye cuz she's going to make a apple pie or something for Dortmund. And so she gets apples and she eats them and then she passes out."

Trying to help get the cat out of the tree or the dog chased him up the tree and was Earth because he was trying to bite him or a combination of the two.

Until when I was a Massachusetts and she was a junior. So anyway, we would meet once a year. We both now. Well, we were always married, we knew each other and now we have kids and kids. They were Middle School age. We started these girls weekends and it became a national thing. And typically we went to Philadelphia we would drive or fly into Philadelphia. We met there or sometimes Baltimore, and they would always start the first night would be like, walk up late, which every time we say, we're not going to do it cuz it always killed our first full day together, but with the up late and we were just drag the hotel chairs in front of a window and wine. And we packed cheese and crackers and Grapes of Wrath. You know packed whatever they could the other person pick up a bottle of wine from the liquor store on the way. And anyway, we would sit the evening and catch up and then the next day we would get up and have a delicious breakfast out.Or just a cup of coffee and then we would go.

We stumbled upon the store, we couldn't figure out the lighting was a little weird imploring was a loss anyway, it turned out to be a great consignment shop. And unbelievable close. I mean, like just unbelievable. Close we would spend hours in there. We try on and we go bags and then we bring those back to the hotel and then we go out for our happy hours, some way. And then we go. For dinner is no kids, no cooking. And then sometimes on some of the weekends, we would do typically the weekend enough was too expensive. So we would just do, like a treatment, like a facial somewhere. The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became. So we're off for like a facial or something and then on Sunday we would always go off our breakfast again. And then whoever had the car would drive the other one to the airport that was it was always our home was a great girls weekend again. Taking"

Thursday is, let me So so the evil queen is not really happy about that because she wants to be the most beautiful girl and I think she needs to sort out her priorities. She's the queen but that's beside the point because what she does is she decides to put Snow White and rags and make her a servant basically. I'm sensing a theme here with all these stories off. So snow I just made cook and clean and wear Rags, but she's still the most beautiful and all the land. Let's be real that face. It's very nice even when it's making funny faces.

Who is the fairest of them all? And the nurses still Snow White that hasn't changed. And so the evil queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel. Her anger productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do because that seems like a very long narrow minded and not particularly useful. Use of such a magic mirrorAnyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point, the queen says to herself. Well, I guess I can't do anything gonna have to kick And so will snow white is out in the courtyard singing into a well, so that you can hear a voice echo back at her because she's so damn lonely. And she's literally been around nobody, but herself off your entire life, she's wishing for the one. She loves even though, I'm not sure she has like a true grasp of what that would actually entail.But basically one day, she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet just kind of creepy. He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself, language birthday, wishing for the woman, I love and then creepy Prince comes in and goes toward out of nowhere and it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet. But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life and she's terrified brightly.And so, the prince goes away and she goes back to a lonely life. And this is the point at which the green is like, will clearly I need to kill her. If this is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this Hudson off. And says Huntsman, you're going to kill Snow White. You're going to bring me her heart as proof. I mean he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like Snow White. It's not like Snow White, has a stone on label that says property of Snow White on her heart but that's not the point is clearly a little bit. A few fries, short of a Happy Meal.So the Hudson goes out and he chases Snow White a little bit through the woods and then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure he could never kill her and so he falls to his knees in education and he says I'm so sorry and he drops the knife and still wakes like and then he says run away and I will cover for you but you better run away and never come back. As the queen is going to kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the Hudson hil's a boar or something, a wild boar in forest and he brings the heart wild board to the queen and says look Queen. This is Snow White's heart.Part of a sport. Isn't it hard to quiz stupid? Basically and the queen says, yes, cook that into a meal for me and then she proceeds to eat this more heart thinking that it's no life. Which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids. I don't know about you so it's no light just went into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her. Boss is making weird faces again. And eventually she makes it to this Cottage where she breaks in breaking and entering also, a common theme in these stories from 6 in and she sees its kind of Dusty and kind of gross. But she sees all in her little row, a bunch of little beds, like for people who are maybe three feet tall with that and she says, well, I'm going to crash in one of those beds later I guarantee it"

So, she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling and then she yawns and falls all across the beds. There are seven of them and she just Falls all across the minutes about her height, give or take and said, she passes out there and about this time of the dwarves are Marching home from work. I hope I hope they work in the mines. There isDark, happy grumpy, don't be bashful. TG. Sleepy sleepy sleepy so 7th. Okay, so there are those seven dwarfs and they work in the mines, Gathering, precious gyms, and what not? And they come back home because, of course, it's their home. There's a little bits for several dorms and they enter their home.And they see the strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that and off. So she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent-looking the dorms are all like. Yeah. Okay. I believe you should stay with us as long as you're in danger as long as you keep cleaning up to place and like make your food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she schooled bad. And so she lives at them happy for some time. And then the evil queen has been sitting snug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day, she saunters up to magic mirror. And she doesn't mirror mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, Still Still Snow White.Still, you didn't kill her and the evil queen flies into a rage and she decided we're going to do something, right? Do it yourself. She probably kills the hunt song, probably interrogate him, and then, kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. So, she goes down to her Lair, where she makes love potions, because as an evil queen, that's something you required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white Apple into, and pulls it out and it took his blood. And it is, of course a poison apple because that is how she rolls.And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples, hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically read and delicious looking I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified, but then she disguises herself as his old Crone and she marches off into the forest. I'm not I don't remember how she found Snow White but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her and all the doors are off to work. And Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her and a friend's broccoli and Snow White answers. The door and says, oh look an old Crone with a magically delicious. Looking Apple. I'm probably completely safe.And the old phone says, what do you like an apple child? And she says, yep. Still safe. And she takes the apple and the current says he has. Child is the Apple"

She just takes a bite off. She collapses and the Apple Rose dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly I'm going to be real. The first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like I can only like getting out and then from there, I can take proper B but apparently Snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as in human Beauty.So anyway, she collapses, the apples out of her hand, the Chrome cackles maniacally as you are want to do and runs out. And then I mean I assume she like hobbles out cuz she still look grown, maybe she, you know, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen cuz she could have made a better get away with the old Crone hobbled away and all the doors come. Hi hoeing home and they see Snow White passed out on the floor and they're like again, but then they realized she's not breathing too well or at all. And so they get on the backs of deer. I think like they ride. Dear God, to go find out who did this? I don't know how the do our tracking. This chrome. Presumably. She just leaves a really obvious Trail but they follow her.and, I don't know. There's a there's a lightning storm or something I think and the Crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic dear. Dear can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her and like will go out of their way to jump in front of her car specifically, and I believe it. I've seen it happen, it's terrifying off. But anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded, men writing them. And so she's understandably freaked out and she climbs up onto this mountain and she's trying to hang on the edge because she's about to fall. And then lightning strikes. The stick, she's holding onto and the ground beneath her feet crumbles and she falls, presumably to her death, but probably not, for sure. In case they wanted to do a sequel.I don't know if that was more of a modern development, they did that in Rapunzel in Tangled, I think golf is probably dead. Hope she said she was scary dead. So the evil queen as the grown Falls to her death and all the doors were like well that was strangely unsatisfying be better. Go check on Snow White and so there is back to Snow White. But she still did and so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin doesn't seem very practical again, but this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality and they put her in this glass coffin and they're more often heard their flowers and tears and three wildebeests crying and suddenly the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion off. And he says, what the heck? The pretty girlfriend before? The super dead? I'm going to kiss her because that is the logical Next Step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her.And she wakes up, I assume she like just sucks out the bite of Apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple and took it out of her mouth and that was censored. It seems logical because if he's like, it's a dead person, you might as well go all the way cuz my Google home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so she sits up and thank goodness. The lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her cuz otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again, cuz she does that a lot."

I bought flippers and goggles and a snorkel and I literally never took them off even to sleep in the worst leg cramps. It was sad. But anyway, I think Little Red Riding Hood's doing the same thing and just gotten the reputation for wearing it. So she's called Little Red Riding Hood.

Like I'm not sure I should talk to strangers and the Wolf says show me what you got in your basket and he rifled through bass good because obviously he can take it, he's a wolf and she's a six-year-old girl in the woods on your own because that's smart.and, I'm not sure what happens. I guess he just he's like, he talks to her. That's what it is talks to her and he says, what you're doing with this basket kid, and because she is six years old and not very smart.

Can't hear me because she's singing along to that heavy metal music to be opens the door and knocks Clermont out and ties her up, and put her in the closet, where she just sits there. Kind of sniffling. I'm hoping Led Zeppelin to herself.And he turns down her crazy too and and gets into her bed. No, no, yes, to me, he has to take her clothes first. He's a weird wolf, social graces is not his port a home. He gets scrambled onto her underwear puts on Grandma's 90, and like her cap and stuff. He doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb to be puts on her night cat. And then, he ties her up in a closet to sniffle and hug Led Zeppelin, and he gets into her bed and pulls the covers up right here.And wait for Little Red Riding Hood and Little Red. Riding Hood, comes up to Grandma's door. Eventually probably like half an hour later because she's six and she knocked on the door. And the Wolf says, oh come in. Red Riding Hood. Says that's weird. My grandma never calls me Theory but I trust this situation implicitly and so she comes in. She looks a the bed and her first response is not her first responses. Hi, Grandma. I am 69 stupid and she goes off the bed and her grandma. The wolf says, oh, why did you bring me dear here? And she says, well, I brought you stuff from my mom cuz I heard you were sick from dancing. Naked in the rain. You need to not do that. So often you should also tell me what to do to dance better in the rain naked, and the Wolf says,Okay, he doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain.

And then, she darts out the front door and I don't know if you've ever chased six year old but, you know, I would not trust a wolf to do it, like, I don't think it's possible for anybody to catch a six year old that doesn't want to get caught. And so, she runs out, the dog kind of Staggering drunkenly after her in this nightie, and mop cap. And Snow White Red. Riding Hood is legging it for the woods and then The Woodcutter comes out and says I've been following your discreetly this whole time because your six-pack really shouldn't let you out in the woods alone. Also have your father and Red Riding Hood says there is a wealth in my grandma's clothing and waged cutter says that doesn't seem likely and Red Riding Hood says look and lo and behold, there is in fact, a wolf in her grandmother's clothing. Chasing her, she could put her showsYou get back to the cottage, I'll take care of this and he holds up this huge acts and the original version. He proceeded to drop off the werewolf off, then they cook and eat the wolf. I said we're wolf again. They proceeded to cook and eat the wolf but that's what happens in this like part of children's story. What happens is he chases the wolf into the woods brandishing, his ex medicine and Red Riding Hood. It was into the cottage and finds her grandma tied up in the closet or whatever. Still humming Led Zeppelin because every Grandma loves Love, Led Zeppelin song, and she spends her grandma summer clothes cuz nobody wants to look at that. And it's around my back in bed and gives her all the stuff from the basket. And eventually her mom comes because her mom still pretty stupid and just followed later. She's like, my cat will be fine in the woods alone. I'll just go up in an hour or two when my soaps and done and so she came up in an hour or two when her soaps were done and they shared a hearty meal from this basket of goodies. And The Woodcutter, came back and said.I changed that wolf so hard, he is probably never coming back. Also, he ran on his back feet and he talked English. Also, I'm your dad and then they lived happily ever after and they all like dancing in the rain naked together."

And so history repeats itself off, he kicks the ball or somebody else's front window of lens in the dude's lab, where he's sitting in his something on his sofa, trying to read the newspaper, he doesn't have the newspaper but it knocks overlap which is you know, further damage that this little pumpkins can have to pay for and the man picks up the ball, goes to the window and looks out. The kid is already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences.Okay. So here is another set of sequences. And again, I just you can take a look at the pictures. Take your time and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle. And Small child has a history of violent behavior and so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it and she checked weather.com this morning and said it was a 20% chance of rain so he's probably okay. It's a little kid. Goes off to school and hold on to the umbrella and let him hold as he's walking to school starts to rain. He's just nice because not only was he, right? He also now doesn't have an umbrella. So he runs back home and he frowns in his mother because he's a kid leaves a lot to say I told you so and I'll let you get to know him an umbrella with which to walk to school and he's already wet. So it's kind of you know, immaterial at this point.For small child. You should not hit people with things, this wouldn't happen, all right? And this is a sequel is just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again with a beginning, a middle and an end. My slime, this bird was in the tree singing at which point the cat, but to itself a cat, I'm supposed to chase Birds. I found her living up to my potential and so the dog, climbed the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow in the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a branch because you can't get down. So you might as well look. Like he did it on purpose at which point the little girl riding by on her, tricycle sees the catAnd thinks to herself that cat needs rescuing because I'm nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat. But the cat is too scared to come down and is certainly not going to jump into a strange home arms because it's a cat they're ornery. And so to go goes and gets your dad and the dad comes back with the ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind a Narrows out there and he's not really about that. So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat, just a stray, dog. If I say the school that you know, cuz the playground sometimes in the kids like to pet, it's a nice dog, but it seems the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident off of stuck in the tree even though he could jump. That's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking up the right tree and so he pulls his cell phone out of his pocket. Probably a flip phone to be a Nokia like something really sturdy. He looks like an old-fashioned kind of guy."

So you scoop them out and you're spread it on one of the breads, which hopefully, at this point, just cool off that you can do that. Brand should be a little crunchy but not toasted person. And so you spread that on there, you don't want too much. Say, CM peanut butter maybe that's a little too thick but that's the idea. You want like a decent amount of peanut butter off and then your scrape. The knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you don't want to wash it off in the sink and get another knife. It sounds like a lot of effort. Let's be frank and then you put the lid back on the peanut butter off their back in the cabinet, you pull the jelly toward yourself, you unscrew that, you set the lid down, gets new, you feel less bad about ruining it because even though it's an equally, perfect surface is kind of Darker. And so it's not as pretty as the golden loveliness of the peanut butter.And so then what I like to do is to stop it also and stir it up a little bit because it's easier to spread. If you're not, just like getting out a group of it to start up some money into a nice little liquid consistency, but it's still, you know, jelly and then you angle it over your second, slice of bread and then you take the knife to scrape some out. You can't find a descriptive out on top of the knife but it'll fall off. Its just scraped him out of the loop stuff and then spread that thinly on top, not too thinly, little less than you did for the peanut butter but not much. And then you take these pieces and you take the peanut butter piece and you put it on top of the jelly peace because you don't want the jelly to fall off. If you put it, on top of peanut butter piece. So right now you have the jelly sandwich or jelly layers on the bottom, peanut butter layers on top."

        "transcript": "Cinderella lived with her father and presumably her mother died. I think that's happened in the original story. I don't know. What does he said? But that's so important because what is important is that when she was a little girl, a little cheerful girl, very nice, her father. He married to this. Not very nice woman who had to, not very nice daughters who had big noses and Angry Eyes Off and Basically pretty sure her father died. Also, I don't remember that. I figure it. Must have been, you know, too tragic for kids but to Grandmother's house and kill everybody starts off. So Cinderella, at this point is left with her stepmother and stepsisters, and no parental, you know, oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the servant, basically, the slave of the family, she doesn't get paid. And her only friends are in the cute little furry animals, like mice, and dogs and horses. There's a cat named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure aptly-named. There's a cat named Lucifer who belonged to the family who is always terrorizing her mice friends and so she has to protect them. They're all you know, good buddies, they sing songs together.And then one day the king in the castle in the distance, very far away. Cinderella looks longingly out the window because she wants something she can't have because that is the fundamental passive Human Assistance. The king says to his adviser. I want my son to get married because he's getting one years and he wants a grand kid. Pretty much is his only motivation for that which does not seem like a very good reason to urge your Heir Apparent to get married to me, but the Heart Wants What It Wants. And so he decided the king decides to turn this enormous ball in which every single eligible, mean in the Kingdom will be invited and biological Maiden. I mean probably over the age of Thirteen months and not already married.The trouble is probably negotiable. So the step family and Cinderella get the invitation and they're all psyched because this is great, one of them could marry the prince not Cinderella, obviously because she's not worth it, but one of the stepdaughters could. And so leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited and Cinderella song. Her mice and birds buddies. Make her address because they want her to go to the ball, also, because they're just nice, they're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this month, she gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball and she puts on the dress, and she goes downstairs to meet her step family, at the door, and to get into the carriage to go off to the ball off, and they said to themselves there and they ripped her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable. So she can't go to the ball because they're meeting.And at this point Cinderella's kind of grind to herself and I'm inclined to be like crying to herself because she's a baby but also I would probably cry because that was a nice dress and like, if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she sitting there crying and all of a sudden, her fairy godmother comes. Why she has a fairy godmother. Nobody's really sure. Presumably because she's so pure of heart. But her fairy godmother comes and says 15 boppity. Boo, And everything is wonderful, and the Pumpkin turns into a carriage, the dogs turn into horses."

Turn into a beautiful wedding gown and The Fairy Godmother says, oh, I see that you still have these Rags on your feet. I'm going to turn them into beautiful glass slippers. This is important. Plot device for later. So I'm going to beat up now home. So Cinderella is all set to go to this fall and she's practically a rocky basketball's, not really, but just to occur, you know, everybody because nobody actually cares about her her life. So she's unrecognizable at this point because she's happy and beautiful. And the Fairy Godmother, says, Cinderella got to get out of this fall before midnight because at that point, everything's going to go to crap. So you don't want that to happen in front of the prince. Want to make a good impression on this guy. And so Cinderella says, yeah, whatever by and goes off to the ball, John by her off, most and dog in a pumpkin and they get to the ball and she enters the grand entrance area.I don't know, she enters and all of a sudden, the prince is struck by her radiant Beauty And they dance. And it's all very romantical and I don't think the princess asks her name, which is sketchy because you should generally off tonight Lose a Guy, you don't know the name of just in general rule, but I'm willing to let her have a pass on this because she was raised by humans.So do you have a great time dancing with the prince, nobody recognizes her and all of a sudden, the clock start striking midnight. And so she books. It she is trash or yard and get home before everything goes to crap because very proud mother actually had some Fair points there. And so, she's running down the steps and heels, which is very, very hard life. I sympathize and she loses a heel, which is fair, and she thinks that one back for it. That doesn't really have time because she still needs to like it to the carriage. And so, she just leaves the home on the steps, the glass in the back, and she gets to the carriage and they start driving off into the distance.And then we get some distance before the spell ends and she's left on the side of the road in rags. Surrounded by mice and dogs and sitting on a dead pumpkin. And eventually, she gets to her sadness. She makes her way home so that she can wallow in misery under a roof. And then, she is, you know, just going about her business, trying to not make it seem like she actually went to this ball cuz her family wouldn't really be about them and off all of a sudden, the the Kingswhen I say you was advisor called an advisor, discovered the monocle, he comes to the door and he says, we have this shoe that The prince was married. Whoever's put the shoe fits and the eagle stepmother thinks to herself is, it's well things didn't go over so well, last night, but if I crash of one of my one of my daughters feet into the shoe for Home Free. So she sneaks upstairs? This may have happened earlier. I don't remember, but she sneaks upstairs, and she walks Cinderella and her room where she swallow living in Missouri. And then, goes back downstairs and they're all trying to put the shoe on their feet. But it's not working. Obviously they have huge feed because they're evil and evil. People have big feet.

She goes downstairs, just as the black flies off, one of the stepsisters feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up, immediately, which is weird to me. Because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass lift up.And everyone panics because the step sisters are upset. Because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the princess dancing with obviously. That's the only reason they can't prove that off and the advisers panicking because King wants to get married. The prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down, the stairs says, but wait, I have the other slipper And long behold, she does. In fact have the other slipper which stayed behind when everything else went to crap, I'm not really sure why Fairy Godmother works in mysterious ways, and so Cinderella goes and she shows the suburbs, but it is, in fact, the matching slipper and then the advisor takes a slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot. I don't think she should be able to stand in real life and puts it on her and it fits beautifully off course. And so, there was triumphant music.And they all lived happily ever after the princess. No Cinderella. She wasn't a princess yet had to get the ring. First Cinderella went off to the castle left. Her horrible life behind and married. The prince Probably still doesn't know her name the end and all right. Awesome, okay, so now what I'll have you do the same type of thing? Well, excellent. The first snow white. Okay. Okay, so again I can cover that follows the tight, so off the pictures less comprehensive knowledge of Snow White's. This will probably be shorter. That's fine.Off this, this what is this face? I get this is panicked but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances off.all right, so so so installed for somebody who vaguely remembers a good, so,I'm not sure it's snow. White was actually a princess or something before the evil queen, you served her throne, or if like she's beautiful cousin or something. And we're just waiting for the evil queen to die off before she snow white blue, send the throne. But in any case, there's this evil queen, she's got the higher legal cheekbones. She could probably a nice looking if she wasn't so evil. So I don't know what she's so insecure about but Snow White is the fairest in all the land."

You had like a little bit ever see with and then, she talks about, I don't know about some other body parts that are big or odd or something like that, and wolf business keys. And then she says, what big teeth you have. And then he says, the better to eat you with and then they run around them.Around. But while that's happening, there is a lumberjack Lumberjack thing. So this Lumberjack South would suck if he looks like Santa Claus in that book and he comes in and he splits the wolf right up and and then Grandma hops out and grandma is safe and off. She invites The Lumberjack to eat with her for the meal, but Grandma's still sick. So she just gets in the bed and I think maybe The Lumberjack, thanks for Grandma's, cute and cheese sticks around to take care of grandma and to be the man of the household.

I had cellulitis about, I don't know. Ten, twelve years ago. DeadAnd you want me to talk about it. Okay. So, yeah, I had cellulitis and I got very, I thought I had a like a stomach flu, my kids were sick and then I was feeling sick, and I just figured, we were all just sick and I, my husband had to go out of town. He left on a Sunday night and I wasn't feeling great that morning I got up and I felt awful. The kids were fine by that point, but by Monday morning, I felt awful like to the place where I could. I remember feeding the kids breakfast, they had their cereal on the table. They were only three and five at the time, and I'd, then just put my head off kitchen table. I couldn't even lift it up and I called my sister because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting the Bentley and Thursday.And I had been for a long time, I knew something was not right, and cuz I actually had been sick for several days now that I think about it because I hadn't showered and I called the doctor, they said, you need to be seen. And, and I called my sister and she thought I wouldn't wanted her to just stay with the kids and I said, no, you have to take me. My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive cuz I can't not throw up. And so, she was like, whatever. Okay, so she came over and I remember wanting to clean myself because I hadn't showered for days, I thought I can't go to the doctor office. And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I went to, I was cleaning under my arm and there was this huge lump. I thought to myself. Oh my God, I developed breast cancer, like overnight and but it was like noticeably in large, dog.So I thought it was strange though, cuz I was sick on my stomach, it didn't seem connected. So my sister took me and she right away understood. When she saw me, how sick I was and, and thoughts kept, you know, having to throw up in the car on the way. The doctor was just so bad. I walked and I, we had just moved to Indianapolis, I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first, that's who saw me. She looked at me and within ten seconds, she said I have never met you in my life. You are very very sick. I can tell that it was like, okay. Yeah, let me lay down, lay down on the table cuz I couldn't even sit up. So, um, they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually cellulitis and that it had, you know, turned into this horrific infection so they were quite concerned about my condition. I need to get blood work right away, Etc. And apparently, they told my sister we she is severely severely ill and off.If she probably should be hospitalized. She's very, very dehydrated, but we don't want to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're going to see if we can get her home, get her a little hydrated, and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever 2, and my husband came home cuz he was so worried. I guess my sister I was delirious at this point."

She is at Great risk of sepsis. And so I just remember it, as I felt bad, whatever. I was, I knew I was going to be fine. My husband's memory of it is that I was dying. And I mean they did say you know, you can't die from sepsis. It's true. I just felt sick but whatever.

And it was, it was a really extraordinary in my mind who wouldn't say that ceremony because my husband's father had a little over a year before that, been diagnosed with leukemia, a rare form of leukemia and we knew that he was not going to live a lot longer and in fact, no, it was not even. Yeah, so it was less than a year that he had been diagnosed but he was undergoing treatments.

And, you know, it was just totally partly. It was because of that and partly, because my husband, and I were so thrilled to be marrying one, another wasted at that Altar and simply solved. While we said our vows to one another, it's just so emotional. We just, we just stood there and stopped with one another and it was just, you know, as if all the world was gone and we were zoned in and off but knowing how significant of an event it was because it was the last significant big event like that of his dad's life."

I thought that I, you know, had a host of different kinds of less controlled moments, growing up with asthma before there were the quality of life, you know, maintenance treatments that there are now for asthma. So I and my asthma is most frequently, triggered by Fowler G issues. And in particular I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle because there non-shedding dogs and I am allergic to all cats. Very deadly. And I'm officer allergic to that. Trees and various molds grasses. Yada yada but cats are probably the worst culprit for me so long.When I was in high school probably a freshman or sophomore in high school, I think my sisters were out of the house at that point. It was just me living with my mom and dad. In one summer, we took a vacation down, know it was in the fall, it was in the fall and we went down for like an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why did not really think about the fact that they had two dogs and a cat, I believe shedding dogs, and a cat. So, we were going to stay two nights with them. So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner and I could tell, I was starting to feel cool and and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother having been my mother always could look across the room off.And when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say it's time for you to go, isn't it? So we kind of reached that point but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room. People try that kind of thing, which of course, never works. Cuz the animal lives there. And I and I can't remember, why should we even opted to just stay there but, we did and are maybe. I said, oh, I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I took medicine and and what not, but by the middle of the night I was beyond, okay? And it was, you know, to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe and there were no inhalers back in those days. It was liquid medicine that a was less effective and be took a long time to activate.Plus if you stay in the space where the stimulus is your medicines only going to last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night I could bear it no longer and my loving. Loving father said, let's go to the car and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night and I so then the next day I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were. But we spent enough time in the house, I just couldn't get past it. I was I was so affected and I am not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did. Stay in that house that night but it just continued to get worse. And by that next evening, we had to go to the ER and back in those days. I suppose they do something. Well, there were dead.

Well, they took all the money and the sailors had em. Go up in, in California for R&R. And so they came on with Geiger counters and the geiger counter service on the ship, and it went out of all the way out, you couldn't even take the radiation amount on it was on the ship that they were on. Well, they went out and gathered all of those men up and, and took them back onto the ship, and the captain was taken off and taking somewhere else, they never saw him again. What when my husband came home? He had radiation sickness, which they told him was ulcers.And he was Doctor Fort for. I don't know how many years and then he developed cancer from from the format and he had his lung removed and thought he had it removed in the hospital.

This has been a long time so he's been dead Seventeen years now, but I, I can log.Live it over but I get the times there's so much that happened. It's hard to remember exactly how it happened and cuz they haven't spend times, but they did the constant urination to kill and kill all of those sales. And there was nothing in there is like a stone wall and the Soul. They put over $10,000 worth of medication into his lung cavity to kill that off. When we went home on Christmas Eve, he was bacteria-free, but they taught me how to irrigate it and there was a container sitting there, as I've never done this before. Never watched them. So she said, I'm sure what show you how she said. I've never done it before either. I said, if you haven't done it before, do you know what to do? And she said, oh, I know what to do.

And so the doctor came in at that time and I said, he's afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity. So he goes out and gets the head nurse and she comes up. That's a whole another. She goes and cleans it out again, but she said I don't like doing this twice and so soon but I feel like I should. But the eleventh day I was at work and they called me and they told me that he told me that he was shaking the bed, he was jerking. So well he said, get him to the hospital. I called the doctor said, give me to the hospital and the bacteria. We run into that nurse in the hospital for we got into the doctor's office and she smelled it the area. She said it's back.So there he had that. He killed all of those blood cells in there. No hope. So he had to wear to visit her being there for years and it'd be better the rest of his life. And so this goes on for eight years that I had changed. Those changed the bandage and and and find out that area every day to give him peace and quiet. And it was very painful. At first I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time to get the the the catheter and all change, it was a procedure. They had been done in the hospital when my daughter was a nurse and she kept wanting me to go to the to the VA because he was a veteran and get the things over there. And they had a bacteria off a committee over there, that might be able to have them. So we go over there. And while we were in this office, there was this cabinet player they had tape, silk pay Pin It Down.It was wet and so I asked the nurse I said, are you get that wide tape? I said, I know on the Mera and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged. So we were paying over, $200 a month for $300 at that time, a month for his supplies and she said she didn't have anything you want. While the doctor had told me before we went over there that it would he would he knew I could do it but he wouldn't give it to me cuz it was a procedure done in hospital. So what she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her bust size catheter I wanted sterilize pins and the and the motion to to irrigate with and everything that he needed and and the stars club Saddam.So, I go home and the first time it needed to be irrigated. Do it myself. Well after I got through I said there couldn't get up because I thought if at that pain that went down into his cabinet that had a surgery to get going back to get it, get that tube that Tube app. And and so I was scared to death but he said I did much better job than the hospital. He didn't hurt him so I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then so I got those sterilized pins and learned not to go through through them.Keep it from falling down into his lung, cavity. And that way I managed to finally get him to her. He was gaining weight back. He went two hundred and some power and then you went down to 126. When you went left the hospital and he came back up for, nobody knew that he was sick and the doctor said that he couldn't have lived if it hadn't been for me. And so he wanted to have the the the doctor said, the only thing that they could do is go in there and clean that cafeteria and put in marbles back in there to make that, to build it up, to where it would you'd have more stability.

Put his arm around my shoulder. He said, I'm proud of you. He said you said exactly what I wanted you to do. So we didn't have it done and he he lived eight years.He wouldn't have had for the, the doctor said for the care that I gave him. And so during that time, the, I started to change the the The tube. I couldn't get it in and it scared me to death. So I called the surgeon which was a cousin of his to tell him, I couldn't get the truck back in. He said, go over to the hospital and let them do it. Well, I took all of the things that were sterilized and told at the doctor at the hospital what to do, and he couldn't do it. So he goes up to the off the floor, to get a surgeon and he comes down a little faster man with a moustache fragmentation, and, and he, and he reaches over to get the pair of gloves Off the Wall. I said, no, you can't use those. Those are not sterilized, he said, he wouldn't hurt him. If I picked up something off of the floor and put it in his back, I said, let me tell you right now, he's laying there because if your negligence you're not about to put something in his back.And he looked back at me and the two nurses, the standard, she, they had looked at me and he left out of the room, and he told the man to go get his destroy of scissors off, turned around, to be sterilized. And so, you took those scissors and he was going into his back and was was stretched that area to try to get that, that open. So he could get the tube in. I says, no, you're not either you call him. Now, he's not about to be been that way, and so he left the room and he came back and he was a wheelchair. And he said want to taken up for x-ray. The doctor wants you to come in on Monday, Thursday, Friday. And to have aHave a ask and and so he wasn't very happy the nurses, what's wrong with you? And I told them about what had happened and they said I'm afraid, I said I'm scared to death but he needs help. So they took him upstairs and the doctor had to school over there. We never saw that doctor game. Don't know what happened to him. I think he lost his job, I don't know, I'm sorry about that, but I was just about to let my husband go through another ordeal of their negligence. And so anyway, it was about a month that off.After that, I developed hepatitis. And he had to stay and take care of me. I was I was going to bed. He had wait on me. I couldn't even have to cut and if I had been cleaned haven't take care of his back. There was no way you could accurate, I wasn't able to in. So God's plan is better than ours is he gave, he healed his bag as the way, I felt that, the exertion could never be. It'd be the rest of his life, he respects. So he could take care of me and then as soon as I went back to work, they told me I've never worked again. I went back to work because they said he would be better than if I what am I working. And so I went back to work he developed cancer of a different kind of in the other love. And, and he did the radiation treatment on that and a month from the David. The finished the radiation.

He said I did everything I could do to help you but he said we had a little bit of help from somewhere other than what I could do Thursday and from that moment on till today, I have not had any problems except occasionally since it was a Chandler area. I was not able to wearHi boots or high shoes because it would irritate it to the point where it would heal. But we finally got over that and I went through the service, I wore combat boots off at all and I've never had any problems since that time never had any limping or anything else. It was foreshortened by about maybe a half an inch but my body adjusted to it. And my right leg bowed enough. So that I never had a limp. But that did create a problem where I had to have a knee replaced a few years ago, because of the of the angle, and the pressure on that knee caused by this over the years. But at eighty-two, I'm still having no problem. I used to when I was fifty, I would run around the block every day in the morning when I got up, but lately, I haven't been able to do, I haven't done it. Really haven't done that too much.

I tell stories on a volunteer basis, at Riley Children's Hospital and it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is a non verbal or has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So I very much have learned from that a not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult, that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them. And that that has that is a lesson because it's easy to make that assumption, as I'm sure, you know, so I have learned to try to pageTake cues from their eye, contact from their facial expressions from their motions. That may be jerky that maybe just excitement. That, that is a response to the story. And while I can, I have no capacity to measure them are cognitive, understanding, and capacity. With this story, I can sense their emotional response to whatever it is that they do. Understand in the story. And it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection off even when there is no speech coming back on their end.So thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from your kid or more recently. I need to be myself now and you can begin this time. I will tell you about the birth of my first child birth. So it was twenty-two years ago on March 14th, I was due on March 9th. I had the Good Fortune of having a fairly benign. You know, easy pregnancy and nothing that happened. Nothing had happened. We were on today five after the due date, and I, that day was singing in a, a very unusual thing singing with a choir that I was part of a small chamber group, I should say that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So I went to the wedding.And we sang and I did kind of notice that, you know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but you know, whatever and off. And the wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber Group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I was just sort of vaguely noticing that just happened, periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial and not, um, I called my sister who lived I was in Sacramento. At the time she was in Southern California, and she is five years older than me, and three kids older than me. So, she already has three children and so we're talking on the phone."

So I was describing a little bit of what I was experiencing that day. And she said, tell you're having a baby today and I said, no, I'm not, because I didn't even, you know, there wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and whatnot. And so I kept saying, no, no, no, no, no, no. She said, yeah, you're having a baby today. So, and that was really like late afternoon when that happened and off by about 6:00, I think it was, I started feeling look more stuff happening and still, I didn't think we needed there was anything big deal. You know, it wasn't like enough, and I think we must have arrived at the hospital by birth.I by 7:30 ish it was like okay yeah this is real it's it's time and so on the way to the hospital and my husband, I think this is my first choice and again kind of confused. Anyway, he is of course you know like oh my gosh you're going to be doing that right now. And and and so of course I was having contractions in the car off. At one point, he was speeding like it was feeding and and he barely would stop for the lights and we all continued to laugh because my words were I yelled at him to slow down and said, it's not about you. It's about me. And I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous, but he, and I just always laugh at that still to this day. It's not about you. It's about me, which was a stupid thing to say, but you know, who is rational at that point. So we got to the hospital and she was born at about 11:30 a.m.5 boy, what kind of amount of my attending. Remember somewhere, after 11:30, because I remember when she was born, then that I was thinking about what date it was, it was the 14th and that somebody had hoped that. If I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday. And I had, you know, missed that one too. But anyway, so it, you know, of course, that's incredible. When you hold your first child in your arms for the first time, but I was exceedingly grateful. That it was a relatively quick delivery and and you know that's not to say it didn't hurt Ashley that's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a, you know, a great experience all in all. And and then we had our first baby.Wild. Now, she's twenty-two. Is that enough also? Tell a story. Take a second to look at them and then when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with a beginning, a middle and an end game. once there was a boy, Named Sam, Sam loved to play soccer, but it was duringThe coronavirus pandemic. So Sam could not play soccer with his soccer. Team, the best he could do, was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around, he kicked and kicked and kicked. And eventually he accidently kicked his soccer balls. So hard, that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house, with his neighbor was an adult man named Ferdinand."

He called a window repair person to come and patch up the window. And he said to himself when this virus is over and I will take the ball back over to Sam. So, look at these panels of pictures, they tell a story. So take a second to look at them and then tell me the same thing that you see with the beginning a middle and an end.Once there was a boy named Bennett, he lived with his mother and his mother knew that it was supposed to rain that day. So she told Bennett that he needed to take his umbrella with him to school, but then it said, no mam, it's not raining outside. I don't need a number that he refused to take the umbrella. She said, you're going to need this later on. She wasn't happy with him, but he refused and said, goodbye well as he was walking to school. Sure enough, it started to rain.

And he spent the day drying out his shoes and school and he got his chair or what but it all dried out eventually, but by the time he got was ready to come home. It was not only raining, it was pouring and there were puddles on the sidewalk.He's stepped into all those puddles. He ran in the rain to get home as fast as he could. By the time he got home, he was drenched and there's mother could not help herself. She said I told you so that it that it felt bad about that and knew that his mother was right.

I'm fine. Don't you know, not so they convinced me they gave me that I should probably go to the ER, in case was something more than what I thought it was and so I did And so I got to the ER, and the doctor there, of course did whatever they do and for, in terms of diagnosing, what had happened and among other things, I had a m r. I think cats can't remember. And it ended up showing that I had off.

So anyway, I went home under the instructions not to drink alcohol ever again, in my whole life. And I enjoyed wine, a great deal.

You don't have any urban sprawl or anything. So you have these little Villages that are just kind of compact and self-contained not that they have that much there. I mean there's really just usually a small store, a post office and houses and so we live there.For a year. And during that time it turned out that they really need a job to move to France. And of course, I was a French teacher and I had lived in fact, as a student. And so moving to France was, of course, like a dream come true for me. And so we ended up moving to France and lived in a city called Vallejo, which is about an hour north of Paris. And I was just in heaven. Just can't even tell you how much I loved being there and my husband into, although, his French was not as good as mine, although it got a whole lot B.

I got this sudden pain in my left leg.And I had to like walk and walk with a little bit of pain back to the car. So, when I got home, I put some ice on my knee and I didn't think a whole lot of it till the next couple of days. And what would happen then was that I would get excruciating pain at times attempt to put my left foot down on even ground in the pain would only be gone as I left my leg off in the ground. Had no idea what was causing this off. The pain was so severe. I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer but in this case you know you hit it with the hammer and it's gone. As long as I should do it on that knee that intense pain would be either so I finally went to a more thorough beating Doctor and after taking X-rays and an MRI wage.Found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot handle tayar, where the senior had actually gone through. And the meniscus was still dead totally intact, but it looked like a teapot where you have that slender handle above the top of it and he said well that's going to continue to do that to your femur screen, go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery and you know you plan these surgeries and unfortunately things don't always go real. Well I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day I think this day it was 1 p.m. so I got there you had to go there an hour or so ahead of time ended up having it done a hospital even though I was going to be in in outpatient and I went in there and they you know clean your leg up and everything and it turns out offThis particular set of Surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up so my appointment at 1 in the afternoon actually took a 6 in the afternoon and they finally wheeled me into the room and you know not having any idea what they were going to do. I'm pulling into the room with the one bed onto the real bed. And I feel these doctors like grabbing my leg and slamming it up against just rubber mount to the left of my leg. And I knew what they were going to do arthroscopic surgery but I had not had any inkling about how this would all happen in life that I thought it might have been so simple. I had asked him to just numb the way."

And then, I started to realize, what I was having was a severe form IDs, which I have very seldom, but occasionally, which causes the pain causes me to pass out. So I tried to find my phone.Particular little pills that cut down on those stomach cramps and I couldn't find them. Unfortunately, I was standing at the time, so I passed out from a standing position down, 100 Floor, scared my husband to death. He came in and tried to wake me. And when he couldn't wake me, he called 911. And so the page, uh, in Nashville, I think you here from the firefighters first. So, I as like, when I woke up, I think I woke up as he told me, he'd they were coming back and I said, oh, I'm fine, I don't need to have them here and he said, I'd rather have them here. And so they came in and they checked me out and feeling very sick andand Rosie very very not not able to think very clearly and so they just they convinced me that I should probably be checked out at the hospital so they took me to the emergency room and uh At the emergency room, of course, you know, you spend hours. Try then, you know, having tests and figuring out what's wrong? Well, they never did exactly figure out what was going on butI mean, I told them why I fainted and they, I guess they understood that. But anyway, I decided that I should have some tests and I had ended up having it either a dog or a cat again?

What she had just said and without any awareness that she was repeating yourself and of course, at first that's you don't really know how to deal with that. And I haven't, I'm not sure honestly, I don't I'm not sure that I did this but I think wage but I would say. Yeah, Mom, we decided on that, you know, a little while ago. And so we're going to do this, so I would tell her what we have decided is your first time.So that gradually got worse. It was diagnosed by her doctors. Vascular, dementia. So she was having little tiny Strokes that were knocking out Connections in her brain. And the interesting thing about that was my mom was real bright Grill in college. And she would tell herself a stories about why she didn't know something. She would read in the paper that somebody had died. And then talk about it and then later the same thing,and then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before and I didn't and so I didn't know what she would. She would make up reasons, logical a logical reasons, why she had known something wrong. She also got really good at asking questions. Instead of asking, you know, making making asking other people to talk instead of having them ask her questions cuz she knew she didn't wasn't able to answer questions, am I? SoI think I'm not sure, but I think that this was some reading that I had done Which said that with a person with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely, no point in trying to help them to remember or or, or Make Up For Heaven's Sake, make them feel bad about remembering things because, of course, there's a period of time in there when you when you realize when my mother was realizing that she was losing married and and it was horrible for her, she felt awful. And and of course, after a while it's bad enough that she has a fever anymore and that's really better.At least it didn't hurt or so much. And I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what experience means, I'm experiencing things mean when you means when you can't remember them, like we would go to plays and musicals and concerts and this was when she living with my aunt and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that, not movies, really. But but musical things concerts and Musical musical theater off.Mom would have no memory whatsoever of that, the next date but she loved it. While it was happening, just was delighted. She was always Musical and off these, this kind of stuff just put, please turn around. And so I had, it was really interesting to think about what would what it means. What that means is it valuable valuable, is it when you don't remember it? And I decided ultimately it was really valuable."

And finally got over the flu and put on several antibiotics. I still was running a low-grade fever and being nauseated at night, you know? AndOne on for a little while but I, I still didn't think it was. Right. So, I went back to the doctor. I think that was the fifth or sixth time, I've been in like four, four or five weeks. and, For whatever reason that he doesn't know. And I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy. That was kind of unusual about her ticket to Cal, plane ticket to California. And so he got on the phone to find somebody. That would do it the next day. And he did find a surgeon, he would and eighty million for the colonoscopy and they kind of put you out. And when I got up off the table, I said, well, did you find anything? And he said, yes and I said cancer, and he said, yeah off. And I'm like, what would we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday andSo Monday, he explained to me, the extent to what I had. He thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation and so they scheduled the operation. Believe it or not two weeks down the road and I said, then I'm going to California. I'm not going to sit around here and worry about this, you know, two weeks. I just couldn't believe that in this day and age, that if you had cancer, they would schedule you two weeks down the road. The doctor called me that night, and I asked me some questions and which I thought was really unusual. Have a doctor Claudia that didn't happen. Very often.You know, the next morning is next, call me at 7 from the hospital, and they were doing surgery. She said, we can get you in Friday if you'll stay. And I said, well, if you get me in Friday, then I'll stay sober. I'm scheduled for surgery, Friday, and had it. And he ended up taking my whole colon. Although I don't left enough to poke everything back up, which was very fortunate. But he thought he got it all, which of course, is everybody's first question.So anyway, I was in the hospital, I don't remember. I was on morphine. and kind of out of it, had trouble a lot of trouble with my I d. And I was, like I said I was on morphine so the IV theme kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing which is not unusual when you're on more friendly this. But anyway, they would let them. They just ring and ring and ring and ring. It was driving us on them and they wait 15 minutes and it's like a card or, you know, the ding ding, ding, ding. And I slept on my way just want to sleep that thing would wake me up. Well,After day of that, I was ready to kill someone. and, They just wouldn't let it go.

Little girls still mostly concerned about the cat and and the bird off to the right singing as long as everything else that's happening."

And in terms of architecture, in terms of the people there, much much less stereotypical French, people up there. In other words, let me give you an example, in France, in Paris and certainly in southern France, people are very low, still waiting line people cut in line, they end up in this great big, huge mob instead.Lines. And it's frustrating for people who are lined standards by nature which Americans tend to be and British tend to be. But friends don't usually accept up in northern France. They are also because again, I'm much more, like, the Dutch. So anyway, it was awesome. We lived in the apartment office on the top floor of five floor apartment building and we had a beautiful. They called Tomas, which is essentially patio type thing outside with lots of space and we have table out there on the street that we lived on. Have been a canal back in the nineteen up until the 1930s when it was filled in and then it'll large Avenue out of it. So, it was much much wider than normal Avenues even Avenues are in in French cities. So we thoughtSpacious and beautiful. And we make friends, we did wonderful. A lot of traveling at that point, a lot of traveling in fact but also in in other countries in Europe because that was Johnson job partly. We went to England, a lot went to Denmark Spain. Germany not really. I forget why I didn't go Germany very much, but anyhow, it was amazing and my French got extremely good much better than it had been. And John's French got really good too.

But I have possibly no memory of it because after a time you don't know what you remember versus what's been told, but I had some pretty severe injuries. I had a severe concussion. I had a kidney laceration, broken ribs, and for pelvic fractures,So that, let's see. I was taken to a hospital on the Eastside. My almost husband picked up my children and took them to my mother. I was in the hospital for two weeks and I couldn't, when I was released, I was on crutches with no weight bearing for most of the summer, we used a wheelchair and I just kind of managed to heal and in, let's see. So that was I had no complications after that and then I think it was three months almost exactly that I was able to walk again, and we were married.So that's the biggest thing that's happened to me. Well, all right, for your next prompt I'm going to ask, can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time? Communicating such as my husband, if you wish that our might to use. Yes. Yes. Of course else. So an experience or just general. All the time.I'm going to leave that up to you. Okay, well obviously living with someone with Aphasia, especially moderate-to-severe is difficult and you should learn different ways to communicate. And then sometimes you just don't one story that I can think of, we, he was able to drive off but not use a phone, which he still doesn't really use a phone and we were supposed to meet at a hotel on the north side of Chicago now plus for some sort of a meeting. I can't remember what it was and he was coming separately and I got there and time went on and went on with what I learned from this. He was driving up and down Meridian Street. He knew it was a hotel. He knew it was somewhere on Meridian Street.But he didn't know which hotel and he had no way to call me and I had no way to call him. And what I learned from that experience and I I can't say I'm a hundred percent perfect on it even today, but his auditory comprehension is horrible. And if I want to be sure, he understands it needs to be written down because he understands what he sees. But like most people with aphasia.They are the best Bakers in the world but they don't really mean to be. They just want to have it be the way it used to be. And so they'll wash their hair. Yeah, they understand. And they don't understand. I've asked him for something from my garage and he'll come in with something instead of saying, huh, so I know he couldn't understand. He'll go ahead and go out and come back in with something totally not related."

There are always times that you don't and you assume they understand they never give you a clue that they don't. And so you end up with the short end of the straw. All right, now, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from any time.Bow, plants, hard to think of things. I have one thing I could say that. I'd be in tears so I can't go there. Probably about the most important thing that's happened in our lives was today, he had the stroke.And how much detail do you want? As much as you want to give? Okay, at the time he had a stroke. He was working with an executive at a gasoline company. And Actually, that's not true. He had a different position by them, but he was doing an audit of a gasoline station and we owned some gift shops that I managed off. And I had come home early because my daughter was ill, and school and said, come pick her up. I brought her home fed her. I just sent her up to bed, she didn't feel well and my life, and it was one of the people who worked for my husband was a young man in his thirties and he, he says, and, you know, I'm here with your husband and I know he hasn't been feeling well, but just goes on and on and he's, but he's on the floor, we're in this the back of this gas station convenience store and he's on the floor, and his eyes are open, but he keeps wanting to close them, and he can't seem to talk.And I realized right away, he had have a stroke just because I'm a nurse and I said to him, is he breaking? And he said, yes. And I said, do you know how to do CPR? And he said, no, I said, well, here's what I want you to do. I want you to First Call 911 and took them to get there and when they do call me back, I said in the meantime, I want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do CPR in case we need it. So he did that, we came as well. One guy says he saw it done on T, I'm going well, it's not real helpful but okay, he says, but I can hear the sirens right now as of that's, that's good. I said, okay, I'll stay on with it when when they get there. Let me talk to them and I'll tell them what's happening and what he's taken and what is history is. So, anyway, long story short, they took him to a hospital birthSouthside of Indianapolis. I jumped into my car with eleven-year-old and a this is so old. I had a bag phone. Okay, this is Nineteen Ninety Six. Even that was not something everyone had. I had it because of the business that I needed to be able to be reached because we have these two stores. I went with"

It was very vacant and I did all the things. You think I squeezed my hand. Blah blah, blah blah. He he did nothing. There was no sign that he was there except that his eyes were open and that was the beginning of a very, very long long, you know, recovery. But he was, he was paralyzed. AndCouldn't speak and really just wasn't present. And we we had this gone for several days in the ICU until he started improving and he was in the hospital for two weeks and in a rehab hospital for four weeks and then he came home. And he was able to walk at that point, not well, but he could walk and went to outpatient therapy for a year and half.Until the day, they said, we don't think he can return to his job. And they said given that you have private disability insurance if he does a job trial, it might show me that he can do a lesser job and that might not benefit you both financially. And that was that day was the end of therapy. There was no easing into it. It was done, goodbye, that's it. At which point I picked up the phone knowing that while he was physically probably where he was going to be knowing he had so much more to do with speech and I called started calling around and I'm a nurse know who to call and I was amazed to find out that Indianapolis has no university-based speech programs at that time, anyway. And I eventually took all different hospitals at the med center and they told me that all the speech was in Bloomington, which I should have known because my sister graduated from that program back. When it was not rehash, it was all school, you know, therapy andI called down there and and talked to the secretary that answered and that was the beginning of our relationship with with the Bloomington speech Clinic. We travelled for twelve years, we drove to Bloomington every week. And he gained a lot from it and we made a lot of wonderful friends. Between the therapists and the other clients we met. And that led to me eventually, starting a program here in Indianapolis and it's the only thing up here for. That's a, a support group and it's modeled after the program in Bloomington.

And the girls are all very excited and Cinderella think she's included. So she there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk. And the only thing I can think that is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress instructions. So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find and her little attic bedroom and mixed with the help of the mice, they make address off andShe gets ready, the night of the ball to go and his told that this was not for her, she's not allowed to go. And as I recalled a ripcord, rest assured, birds and they go on to the ball, and she goes back to her walking place. The next thing we see is we've got some Ice Age animals around being empathetic, and then her fairy godmother appears and the Fairy Godmother Webster up, a beautiful white gown and a pumpkin Carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, something scared the horses, and that was before this month. So, anyway, the pumpkin Carriage is all good. She gets in the carriage, the Fairy Godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight for it all goes away. So she goes to the ball, the stepmother and sisters are important to see her and not happy at all and the princess Enchanted and they spend the evening dancing.

She loses one of the glass slippers provided by the Fairy Godmother and the prince finds that and she gave birthand, She she's sitting with the animals looking at the glass slipper with good memories. So now, the print still has a class slippered, sounds everyone out looking for the, the girl with the glass other glass slipper. And when they hear about this stepmother and stepsisters they realize it was her, and they don't want him to know, so they walked her in her room. However, the little animals, the mice especially bring a key to get her to unlock the door. So she can come down and be found to turn on the silver. And that is what happened. She goes downstairs, tries on the glass slipper the prince realizes. He's found his ride home, and that's not the end of the stepmother.

Remember, I remember saying tell Richard, I need to call call Richard and tell him I needed. And so fortunately, there was a home very close and he ran and used the phone, of course they called 911. So my husband was on the opposite side of the city and hit the fountain. Flying all the way across and the younger child was in the back seat and I don't remember looking at him, but he didn't seem to be hurt voice. And they, they weren'tSequestered they had to cut me out of the car with the jaws of life and they were putting me in an ambulance just as my husband-to-be arrived and he followed the ambulance and saved them while they checked out the kids and took them to my mother's house and who was on the third side of the home and she kept the boys, he came back to the hospital by the time he came back. I think I was having tests run, I don't remember any of this part, except for having a bad connection to my VP guide and a red, have a flash of being in an elevator and I remember that I felt hot and sweaty. It's weird that I remember the reaction, but that's all wage. I don't, I just remember hot and sweaty was a bad sensation, I was in the hospital for two weeks to had pelvic. Fractures ribs concussion dead,And I would call my mother. I could remember her phone number and from the very beginning, I would call her constantly, and I'd say hi. Where am I? Hi, I am I bless your heart. She just she'd answer the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we do it again. This went on a lot but as the days went by the concussion off a little bit better and I remember they took me to a whirlpool bath and using, you know, a whole harness system to lower me into this tub and I'm not sure it helped that it off. So I was releasing the hospital after two weeks and and my husband came by every evening and brought outside food because the hospital through the subject. So I went home and I was on crutches with no weight-bearing all summer. So this was in about this time in June about maybe June 23rd.and, We had a wheelchair, we used to when he got home from work, you know, we we filled the wheelchair in the car and get out of the house cuz I was getting a little stir crazy.

And after having chemo. Six years ago, they have a worse. It actually had improved and the chemo really made a difference. Excuse me. So I have you think I would know how to handle this by now? But you still forget and one of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left back. He's so gone for the hardware store.and, I'm I think I would not done before I make a list of what he was going for, because he might forget. And then he has to explain to the people there. Although he has has so much therapy that she can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants and it's very rare. There's a failure there, he draws a lot of little tiny black but I've learned that to be sure. It's hard to remember to verify all the time and it doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend and maybe he thinks she talked to him. So how do you discern between those two things that's quite difficult him? Does he think he understands perfectly or does he not understand? That's not really want to say, he doesn't understand. So things like that. Make it very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him.You can take it to the vet, totally understand. If he sees it written, I know not to ask him numbers out loud cuz he can't say numbers out loud. I did find out in the last week that he can repeat thanks to you and that is something he has never been able to repeat not even one word off an apple seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think you can tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask him to receive the word. It's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability. That'sI've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man because women are more other, women are more caring, more empathetic, a less frightened and I think men are not in general. So there is this learning curve for men. They they have this discomfort and so it's just easier to avoid. And I always feel badly for him because he is loved out a lot and I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter to explain to people what's wrong, and please don't interrupt andplease turn the TV off or please turn the radio off or You don't have to shout, although I don't find that so much, but some people do people are not comfortable with disabilities. They don't understand. And even if they understand them a first, they feel awkward cuz they don't know if it's sensitive and it's going to upset you to talk about it. Please tell me it wasn't doing this for twenty-five years for not going to get upset about it. It's just what it is. So if it's, it is very difficult to for him to be in a group of people and not be able to contribute."

Now, we spoke too much to be able to use devices when Palm Pilots were first, used in speech therapy and late 90s. Early 2000 Medicare would not pay for them unless they have Naveed additions. That may prompt Pilots so wonderful and useful it couldn't have a calendar and a half games and it couldn't have a calculate all the the functions Medicare said they would pay for them. If all they did was helpless Foods.And we ended up with palm Pilots around the house anyway, but he had too much verbal speech by then to use a device off. So for some people have no speech, it was awesome. And I think it still is to the state.

I don't think their rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing back in clinics, I think, but this is an old post-war building and I believe that's two or three stories high and it was a woman's hospital at the time I had my first two childrenAnd the most amazing thing about this room. Is it? There were windows and a door with it was on the second floor and there was a still, there you go to the Riley. Right, as you can see it off.

And there was this lovely spring Breeze blowing through the door. I know that sounds like a strange way to remember this, but it was so unique because you never oh my God, never find that today. But it was really an interesting experience to being a delivery and I'm a nurse something. Yeah, that team even stranger but it was quite delightful was almost like having a homebirth only in the hospital setting but everybody had wage you needed there butanyway, that that was Yeah, it was very special day. First child is always a very special experience. Here's another series of pictures that tell a story whenever you're ready. Please tell me this story. All right, we have a boy probably in his backyard. Playing soccer practicing. And he took the soccer ball and it goes through a window. We don't know if it's his palm or its neighbors home. But it goes to the window, breaks the glass and not only does it break the glass, it knocks over a lamp, probably breaks it too. And there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by just breaking glass and lamp falling over dead and he gets up and goes to the window.Holding the ball. And that's all I can see. I think that's all he's looking at the window to see who hit the ball. Here's another took the pictures that tell a story whenever you're ready. Please tell me the story in this. In this story, mom is sending her little boy off. I'm guessing to school, because he has a backpack and she wants him to take the umbrella and he is a not all and oh no, I don't need the umbrella, they'll be fine until he gets the third picture and it starts raining and he is, it's raining and there's puddles of the downpour he's getting soaked. So turns around and goes home.And Mom, let's add another sternly almost like you deserve it and the next picture, the end of it, he sets off her school again. This time he took mother's advice home and have the umbrella. Thank you. So here is a picture which you have. Definitely soon, I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and then tell me a story. Okay. And this picture, it appears that we have a cap that the dog chased up the tree cuz the dog is still Barking, Dog. The cat is out on a limb and there's a little girl trying holding her arms up. Hoping to catch the cat. Her tricycle is in front of her and there's a letter on the ground and that apparently, that is up the tree and I am guessing that dads are ladder and climbed up the tree to try to get the cat and the dog. Probably not the latter down.That's not for sure, but the latter got knocked down. So now we have cat and dog, cat. And Dad 2nd Street, and someone has called the fire department. There's a fire truck parked out on the streets and we have two firemen dragged him towards the trees with a ladder to resolve everything and there is one other detail Maps. There's a bird on one of the branch."

Well, I don't want him to not have to speak for a little while, so I'm just going to let him know. Cancer is brain would be fine. What could go wrong. So, you know, he does it. What I learned was that posterior fossa mutism is just kind of old archaic almost way of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior.

I on paper only, I guess I've wrote lost maybe a hundred thousand hours, but as long as you don't sell nothing, you haven't lost it. If you understand what I'm saying, that's where a lot of people. And I don't understand the business World telling these people, especially that off the mutual fund Brokers. And I had telling people to cash their stuff in and go to a mutual fund while it's to me, that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example. I've got a lot of a Proctor & Gamble and it was up all last last summer. I guess around $74 a share right now it's about 48 or 49 V. Now until somebody to sell thatCan take a thirty $35. A share loss is kind of ridiculous to me. But now that, I guess that's the way these agents, you know, make their money by talking to people the public into relinquishing. What they've got is that's good. Now, I don't say, you should keep all your stocks, but you give a blue chip, you know? Then I mean I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive shares that matter of fact, just last Friday I want to have them bought thousand shares of Ford.And also, I put in about 1,000 shares of AK Steel. Now, if you really being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier, and I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday when you get a lot of a diversified, you know, opinions and To do sell the automobiles out. That doesn't make sense, but now an AK Steel has the same way. They were $74 a share and now I put a bid in for $6 this year and I'm pretty good at with was 576 when I started playing phone tag with a broker. And so, like I said, last Friday I went to wash the third met a broker there and we put it in a buy for it. Now if you don't understand what the by means, it was selling 6:21 unless that when it goes down to 6 by me, a thousand shares of it.my reason for doing that has, Obama wants to, excuse me, improve all the infrastructure. Okay, infrastructure mean steal and that's where he's still coming and although they haven't completed, you know, through Congress, what they wanted to do, what they're trying to say. Buy American, I really don't believe in that. But the it's really going to push the American Steel up and All American Industries are going to start making recovers, but it was funny. I just listened this morning on television before I come down here and the state of Kentucky.Is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States. They're trying to pass that right now. So that's like to me, never some most interesting thing to me and the The words thing was losing all that money in my age. Of course, I don't have to sell anything and I'm not going to sell it. Maybe my ears will help. My wife will. But hopefully by then if I lived a long, it'll go back up again."

This is not good andThis was in high school and back then. I had to go to a school nurse for for anything and so then she took a look at her and I said something to the school doctor. Dr. Set it. It was just wasn't broken. It was just dislocated and he just pulled it out and put her back together for a big splint on it. Fine. And Two weeks, whatever going by and I'll go to the doctor and the doctor said, well now I have we have to start spending this finger because otherwise it will get stiff. So I stick my hand out there and he bends it and I'm going through rough there's not a good thing, you know. All come on. He says come on this. This can't be hurting that much you know, a way that have been it one more, one more time. I stick my hand out there then and he's going nuts. Cuz he's mad because I mean this is hurting but he's not home. So you put the bank back on so it will come back in a week and we'll look at it. We Clara come back along.

So they have a little shorter finger and they put a little curve in it off andAs it turned out, I believe it would have been a lot better if I just hadn't cut it off because when you make fish, really a little can't bend that finger. So you don't have a lot of strength in that finger either.

And then when she grows up she is kind of like taking on this a made for the evil stepmother in the evil step-sisters and they all like tell her to like clean the floor and wash the dishes and like make their food and stuff like that. And eventually get one day, the king of this Kingdom that she lives in decides. He's going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his birth.On the print, the evil stepmother gets invited to the ball and she decides that it would be a great idea to have her to actual daughters, go off, and she schemes to have Cinderella stay behind and Cinderella doesn't know this. So she is like, mystified and she makes address and she gets prepared. And then when she took shows up to go to the ball, the evil stepmother, like tears, off her necklace and like shreds of her clothing and says that she's not allowed to go because she's simple, and she's not like one of the family. And so but evil, stepmother goes with the evil stepsisters to the ball, and then Cinderella cries.

In like, gives her a magic dress in glass slippers and provides her with them.Everything she needs for this party and she heads out to the party and her pumpkin will wheel pulls up hops out. Stuns, everyone walk inside. Instantly the princess, like, this is the future wife and then walks over, they danced together, and then the evil stepmother and stepsisters, see that they're dancing and it's are shocked. I don't know if they recognize her, but they're shocked to see that they aren't. The ones who are going to dance with the prince, but Cinderella has to leave because her magic wears off at midnight which is stupid. That doesn't make sense to me if it's magic. It should just work but she leaves probably for a good plot point and returns back home as herself, not in her like gal dress, but she left behind a glass slipper which the prince finds in the prince, uh, is mystified dead.Her and decides that he's going, he has to go and find out who she is, so he rooms the land fitting, a shoe on to Fair maidens. Trying to figure out if they are the one who eat against wage because apparently, he just can't remember her face. I guess he just can only remember her shoes size, but eventually he arrives at the vet Cinderella's house where the evil stepmother has like locked her in a building at this point. From the movie though, I don't know if it was still look and then like the animals like help her get out of the room and then she shows up downstairs when the princess like fitting, the shoe on two stepsisters feed and like their feet are like way too big and like, are squishing in. So he's like disgusted. And then he sees her and like, kind of instantly knock at her. But then like hash to put the shoe on cuz once again, I guess you can't just remember her face and and then Shoe Fits they fall in love and then evil stepmothers. Like"

Like that song was really fun but I one of the issues have always had with swim team. Is that I would love going to the practice and talking with the people in the teams but won't ever. We would compete was when I would get like super nervous. I would be very on edge and there were times where someone had asked me like I need you to do this race for me or like I can't do this race and asked me to step in and be I would have likedGoing into a situation and saying, okay, I only have to do these few races where something that like, kept me, calm during those.

So when this Regional race came up, it was the first time I had gone to it because I missed it my freshman year cuz I had to go to some family thing. So it was the first time I was there. And what had happened? Last year was a glass place out of everyone. So I was kind of glad I wasn't there. But this year our instructor or coach was telling us that like he was really, he had high hopes for us because we had one like a majority of our, our other competitions or other means. So he put everyone on their usual races off.And then for me and some other kids he gave us some extra races which was something I never dealt with before. I'd usually been put down to do like two races, or maybe occasionally three. But I think I had four for the summer and that was that was like crazy to me."

First, off the way that the game is set up, there are nine innings in any consists of where each team gets the bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, the the visiting team bats until they get where called them out. And then they switch sides where the the home team, then comes the Bad and the visiting team that is in the field and then they get three outs once both teamsHave their three outs that is one in. When you do nine of those sets in the defensive position, there's you know there's several different positions, there's 9% off, one of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher and then at home plate as a catcher and then we go around. We go of a first baseman, a second baseman, the third baseman, there's someone that stands between 3rd and second base called a short stump and then beyond the diamond is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out and and their goal offensive goal is to there's two ways you can make an out. If you can catch the ball in the in the fly through its encounter, catch the ball on the Fly and the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws the ball towards home, like the batter hits and if the batter hits the ball and someone in the field, catches it for it, hits the ground. That is 1. LThere's something called balls and Strikes. Where if the battered misses with his Bat and the pitches in a certain location, relative to the person's body and the and the actual physical base at home like that's called a strike. It's outside that lateral movement, it's called a ball. You get three strikes and you're you're you're the batteries out or if you get four balls in the back to free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits, the ground is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets the first base. Then that matters out if the batter makes it. The first base before the throw is there he gets. He's safe on a space."

        "transcript": "The bases are safe spots where they cannot be out if they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. That's another way that an out can be generated. Let's see the way that a run is scored. Is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first second third and then touches back on to home plate? That's 1.21 wrong. I just mentioned that there's a field Beyond The Diamond. There's usually a fence behind that those those players that are in the Outfield, tell the Outfield. If the batter hits the ball over that outer fence, then it's a home run. And so he gets a free unimpeded trip around for each base, and that's a point if the battery is a whole run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around, and he scores a point, and then the batteries gets a point. So it's a two-run homerun.So you you try to get more points or runs before. You are all of your, 27 outs are exhausted. If you are tied up both teams, have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning. Then it's kind of a sudden death, like, whoever gets the most runs. We're both teams equally have a Channel or runs after that, they win the game. So if you're tied in the 9th, and then the visiting team comes up first, as they start the game, they start batting, they score a run, they get then they get three bouts. The other team doesn't score, they get their chance they get 300. No runs. Then the visiting team is won the game. There's no claim that the games can conceivably last forever, but they the the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points.Some of the strategies that people employ. Are you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to get the ball and there's different types of pictures or some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow off. And then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So cuz if you have a player that can catch the ball down the field, and has a very strong arm and throw the ball to first base. And before that batter hits, they're then they're, they're, they're valuable for the offensive team. Some skills that you want. Is you want someone that is strong that has really good hand-eye coordination and that that can hit the bunk bar and hard. Some specialized players are dead.They're skilled that speed. So if you have someone that is marginal hitting, but he's fast and they can hit the ball and then but they're fast, the First Basin can get there before. The other team is off, is able to get the bulb. And then, and then it's, it's a valuable valuable position as well. That's basically the gist of the game."

I think of that, those eleven one is a goalie each each team as a goalkeeper in a goal on a patch of grass about the size of a football field. Maybe. Yeah so it's like three hundred feet lengthwise, maybe like 150 feet with wise so that that comprises the boundaries of of the playing field, the playing space and the eleven players including the goalie comprised halves of the playing space. So the that blank space is cut in half. There's 11 on one side, 11:00 on the other and then Thursday.Kind of half-time sides are switched but the way it starts is a coin is flipped and whoever wins the the coin toss team will start kicking the ball to its teammates from from the center of the field home. So what happens is, it's Eleven on eleven, there are different lines of that eleven the way it's ordered on on the field with the the people in the front of that group of eleven, their main task is to score on the opposing goal. The ones behind them were kind of defense and offense they can score but their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score and then the people behind them. It's usually 3 a.m.Before are like the last line of defense, they're called Defenders. And they, they keep the ball far away from the goalie if they can and the goalies. The absolute line and last line of dead. It's kind of guarding the goal and keeping ball from going into the gold. On the major rules is that the only person that can use their hands except on out-of-bounds throws or the off-lease, the goalies can use their hands in any time. But like, any other players, they were touched the ball. That's a penalty with, with their hand. They're, they're just moving the ball by doing, what's called dribbling or passing with their feet.Scoring happens when the opposing team, kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net, into the netted goal, and they can do Thursday through what's called a penalty. Kick a corner kick or just regular game, played kick in the goal. The duration contest last seventy to ninety minutes, and the teams that do the best are constantly, moving the ball and triangles. I think this is my theory where there are passing the ball to each other in triangular, formations. They're spreading out and triangular formation over the playing field and giving the person with the ball like, you know, options of Passage, you know, pass the ball to two people at different points in the triangle and there, there you can pass backwards, you can pass for words, you can pass across the field to open space."

Fifteen days off the 10th day? Actually hemorrhaged. And butOther than that I can't remember too awful much about it. Like I said, I didn't have terrible pain, some discomfort at first and then it was just a matter of lying there in the bed recuperating and I had I wasn't allowed to give up to go to the bathroom because I had a catheter for, at least the first ten days and that wasn't the nicest thing in the world.

And a sling is the volume of his voice is just faded away and he it's difficult to hear him and so if I have to ask him to repeat it, sometimes he gets irritated down there but he can do a little better if I asked him to try a little harder than he. It's better, it's more distinct.I recall I was extremely frightened when my thirteen-year-old son ran a huge look into his hand and had to be rushed to emergency and then it was so painful for him to have this big hook. I took him to the hospital with the hook in his hand because we were afraid to pull up, we might do further damage and so he was sent to the Hand Group at Jewish hospital and they had to open his hand and remove it because this hookup had left the rusty pack, but it was very fortunate that it's sort of pushed everything out of the way, as it entered his hand because otherwise, they were afraid that he was going bone and tendon damage, but he healed fine. And there were no bad side effects from it.There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water and at the very, the current is very rapid and she's extremely frightened. But someone else, maybe she was white water rafting because this other person has on a life preserver, and he is trying to save her. She's holding, he is holding onto a tree, and I imagine as she is farther down. I can't see her hands, but they're both hanging on for dear life and I'm sure he's a, he tried to help her Johnny plays soccer with the school team. And so, he's out on his front.

They needed all along. And then the way it's scored, cuz you have to lay your cards out if you have three of a kind off and put that over to the side. If you have four in a row, we put that on the side. Anything that you have that's left over.

And I've opened up that dog and my whole life changed. After that, she broke down the gift of healing and going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I had never heard of. I mean, I went to a Catholic school and was kind of like religion is like politics and sound for me and she just opened up the store that you can heal through this song is being prepared is asking for help with something that was so boring to me. Just ask for help and so I started doing her writing exercises. I said doing a meditation song like I said, threw myself into this lifestyle. I started praying every night celebrating every morning and I started noticing that my wife was getting lighter. That was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have before birth.Because I was walking myself and she showed me this box, right? So picking up that bug in dedicating myself to spirituality in the biggest thing being meditation, she had no except she wasn't like a, like do two minutes. You would like sit down for five minutes, you have time for this. This is so important. And that book led me to daily prayer to meditations to travel like far beyond what I ever thought that I was brave enough to do that, led me to India where I became the yoga teacher. It's like a V Gabrielle Bernstein on several occasions. I listen to a podcast regulate, I share a message and I swear like, I've been on the site for twenty four years, but I didn't start slipping until about two years ago. I had on my shelf now, like, I think about a job and how I can get back to their people and how you travelling, how you care for my family, and I can care for people that I love. But the number one, priority above starting a family or starting a career wage,Is to continue this meditation practice and to give this piece back to.

This little story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind and I still don't feel this month. So, my first semester of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa and Iowa City, but my family is from DC and I had a car. So drive, back and forth over break up with my car. It's about a thousand miles. So generally takes about two days. So, the first semester back, it's winter. I am driving across I-80, which is goes through a very flat states with a lot of corn. So it is an extremely boring, repetitive Drive. There's a lot of you know, driver tunnel, vision that happens. And it's cold and grey. So it's not even a Greenfield, it's just empty, I'm damping Fields, but I'm kind of proud of myself cuz it's my first semester went. Well, I was real independent excited, so I'm on I-80 and sort of them.And there's a slow down and it's very flat so I can see it had. I don't see that there's construction, I don't really see an accident but I, you know, figure, Something's Happened, probably minor accident. Looks like a jingle a, it's kind of pissing me off. At this point, is only two lanes in each Direction and there's like no exits. Nothing built along it and we get closer and closer and closer, and I still cannot see what's going on. I'm just like, what this be and we get a little closer. I see. Okay, it looks like I'm I'm in the left lane and then there's a medium between the, you know, Eastbound and Westbound roots, and I'm going east. And I can see that there's something over in the median wage, I left and it looks as I get closer, like, an animal, I get closer. It looks like a fairly large kind of mine. The game. Is it a moose moose?There would be a moose in Illinois, but it looks it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it. So getting a little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes, why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead? A long time. I just want to get home, I get closer, and I can see that there's these kind of large, hind legs. So it's oriented. We're basically looks like the bulk of the animals basically facing the car, and there's kind of a long tail and it's brown, and it's this big hump. Oh my God. And I get, I'm getting closer and closer and closer and I, you know, my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to the pattern magic. What is this thing? I don'tWow, it's too big to be a dog and I'm literally, as I'm passing it. Like my head is, you know, we're just creeping up on my head is sort of like, turning off watching it and getting more and more interview. And it's only till it's like at my shoulder and I passed it, but it my mind kind of pattern matches and goes, it's a kangaroo a look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me. And I felt like the next five miles going wasn't anything else he was? He was clearly kangaroo. I saw the ears. I said the big massive tail is something behind legs. As a little tiny front legs, it was a canker. And so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know. I just don't, I am so certain and so uncertain but it must have been a kangaroo and I've even searched. I mean this was Okay, so this was the winter of two thousand, two thousand one. So the internet was a badass not like Google was around but there weren't really if you didn't know how to start."

We're also we lived in a very rural area New Mexico up in the mountains lived in Taos, which is the biggest town that we lived in which is not a very big town at all. So when we came here, it was absolutely shocked. I mean, just the fact that they had sidewalks like it just amazed us and the Street Lamp that everything. I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east of the East are so mature money. If so much richer and they can afford to do all that, you know, we had a lot of unpaved roads out there. Of course, the there's a lot sparser population so a lot of times they're not paid his huge, long roads all over the place but here it's just amazing to see all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city, it was just Indescribable big impact off.Had honest, I think it took us years to really kind of overcome the culture shock. So I mean I remember that period of my life all the time and what is just the immense change that we underwent and that we had Spanish accents, very heavy. My parents always says there a lot but we have such a terrible candidate school. People using us and everything and and we really tried hard to emulate English speakers. Especially I used to listen to this, David Niven for some reason I was really crazy and I wanted to talk to him.

Maybe we can pull the object like a cellphone or whatever.

I can kind of read her mind for the most part and know what it is. She needs like today wage I knew she needed some kind of check cuz I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card.

And I started off having numbness in my hands and my feet, and I was stumbling. I'm just having a hard time, walking, and I knew something was wrong. And I just thought, I really kind of thought it was fate. I thought maybe I had a brain tumor or something, really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned home. I'm going to Universal Studios and I wasn't in pain, so but I was just having a hard time walking. You Embrace. Set your fingers and toes off.And then it works works in so I can't, I can remember this going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair. So that evening by the time, we all go back to the, our hotel. I was really quite concerned. I did sleep in the next morning, they took me to Scripps Medical Center in the San Diego area and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed because the hombre effects, it's, it's a autoimmune disease and he asked me if I had had the flu recently and I had. And so the the antibodies that attack your flu Jab, Tak your own system and this was what was happening. So they told first they wanted me to the hospital and I said, no way. I was going back to Phoenix wage.When they did certain, they asked me to like shuffle a deck of cards. I couldn't do that. And snap my fingers, I couldn't do that. So I got back in the car with my friends and my daughter was with us and he said, if you have trouble breathing because it can go all the way in its you know, affect lots of affects your muscles to find the nearest hospital. But I got back home and it took me about six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery for about six weeks. I couldn't drive the car, I couldn't I could feed myself but I could cut anything up. I could shower but I couldn't turn on the shower. I had no strength in my hands or my feet. I couldn't stand on my toes. Any of that kind of thing off? So then I started it, wherever it goes, you know, from the inside from the outside, to the inside of your body, and then it stops, and it's just your body stops and starts healing.Again, then it was a slow recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit, but I do remember the, the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister, she was living with us at the time and I just felt like an old lady, and this was over twenty years. I was in my forties, and I was just holding on to the grocery cart for, dear life, because my balance was so poor. And I was just afraid of someone knocking me off over, but I recovered, I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands. I I can occasionally have a hand Tremor, but I feel like I'm nineteen thousand percent better."

We decided to move to Arizona shortly after we arrived in Arizona, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me because I knew no one here. I have no friends and luckily, I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me and put me on a drug which I had to take called tamoxifen. I live in the lakes in Tempe which is a very pleasant place to live. And over the years over the five years that I am taking this horrible medication. I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me and I feel very grateful for my friends for the support that I got at that time. And also grateful for the knowledge that it's been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer up till now touch wood and there is no recurrence of it.I could remember when I first, I worked for the BBC. I was, I was an actress for many years in London, and in Sydney, Australia. And I, when I left with my German husband, when I left Australia to come back to Germany, my my my German, my gift of the German language was not very large. And I already had one child who was born in Australia and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home and I had to do all, I could to learn a language as soon as I could which wasn't very easy because I had a sister in law who was not very kind at that time. And every time I made a mistake in Germany she used to. She used to make fun of me. And I used to be very resentful about that, but because I was, I guess so ambitious at that time. And because I was good at dialects and birthI think this has something to do with musical ability because I'm able to hear how a language sounds. I learned, I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year. I would say, I mean that's that's all I can say about language.Very much so I was four years old when the second world war started and I was living in Cardiff that time which is the capital of Wales. And we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit, and my parents had decided to send me to Thursday to live with my grandparents who lived closer to the coast in Wales. And about two days before I was due to depart to, to live with my grandparents house was flashing and luckily we were in the garden at that time in what they call an Anderson shelter and we heard obviously what was going on each side."

Well, actually, I was by myself, I was flying solo not in formation with anybody. It was, it was just a, just, a regular training fly to and hours to my logbook and out of the airplane and also, a physician see, just practice practice this practice that. Well, in those times, wewe had a a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway and 340 knots AirSpeed. When directly over the air. When we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back till Thursday, airplane, onto a wing, and shot back on the stick.

Sufficiently that would be safe to drop the the, the landing gear, the flaps of the speed brakes, which I did.And that was called the downwind leg at 180\u00b0 after that, the airplane is slow enough. So that we would we would have not touched the throttle another of a cut power completely and just bring it on around to the, you know, to a, a full 360-degree turned and then land on the runway. Welcome. The the, the the legs of the Eva of the pattern are called the approach 180\u00b0, the downwind.Ninety Degrees from that is the base and following that is the final. So just you actually flying in a circle. Well, here I am on the base leg off with no power. All the garbages out, we call it garbage, speed brakes, the flaps and the landing gear. And all of a sudden I'm about, I don't know, three or four thousand feet off the ground. More than that. Maybe five, six. Seven, eight hundred feet something like that. I'm not really sure the airplane started a shutter. A shuddering is the sign of a stall. That means they. Yeah. And they had one of their planes stalls. That means it's falling out of the sky. And I knew immediately, people do not survive these situations like this and not yet. I automatically didn't even, I almost didn't have time to think, but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of Records wage.Off the end of the runway.

I could of been painting it on.Well, eventually it did it did come to rest in the yard to the right?

I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again. All they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground. They towed it back in to the hangar on its own wheels and it did fly against o. Of course, but in this this moment of panic was it was only blind, you know, holy a quick.

Because the conditions getting worse is my husband's mother and she had a hearing loss that started in late 70s and do not have anything done for it. So, it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't hear what you're saying to her. Most of the time in order for me to communicate with her, I have to get in front of her speak directly to her. I think she's become very Adept at reading lips and figuring out what you're saying without hearing it. But I noticed, if I would come up behind her, my thoughts that I could carry on a full conversation, she would never turn around. So that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad. She now has the beginnings of birth, basically, Alzheimer's of the dementia type. So in addition to the difficulty, hearing she also has difficulty remembering and you can see her now and see her again. And30 minutes and she won't remember that she saw you 30 minutes ago usually as a normal rule she does recognize this you know and is able to communicate at her level with that but basically we've learned that we have to be in front of her to be able to communicate with her otherwise. You're you're having to repeat everything so many times. You don't know if she's heard you or not so long. That's about all you can do with that.

I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt Hospital home and my right lung had filled up with fluid and so they kept me. I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked the towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel. If you were to take a bath or a shower, they didn't come. So I usually stood guard down the hallway to see if I can find a towel. I have veins that are very difficult to get blood. So I'd always say kiddingly to the people who are really good at this.And one man named Joe L told me he was terrific. He, he died no problem. After about 20, pokes in my hand, I said could not find someone else to draw blood because we're not getting it done here. And it was really all she could do to get better. So I could get out of the place because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid, and that facilities are having trouble today, getting the help that they need.I can also tell you about the landing. That was my roommate for the first night. Of course, I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things and she couldn't find the bathroom so long. She just used one of our facilities. She could find. And when I said something to the nurses, that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient this down. So I was so unaccustomed to hospitals and I'm probably unaccustomed to the treatment they're off because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before and I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there.So that was my experience.

Stephen that so sweats the telephone around to the other side and volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to a slide and it was much quieter. So I figured there's something wrong with the ear on the left ear is not hearing the way it should. Anyway, went to the ENT specialist and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma but just a little tumor that grows on the nerves. That run through your skull, we did some research. Found the surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery, I went out had the surgery. Performed further, surgery itself,First thing I do is shave the side of your head. I got a haircut before I went out, so it would be short. So I wouldn't look like I had real long hair on this side wage, I remember the prep. I remember the shaving for the for the surgery, then you're under your totally out of it. I didn't wake up and have contracts until what I think was the second day following the surgery, they keep you out because they don't want you moving around the surgery. Involves cutting hole in the head off so they can get into where the nerves are, get the tumor take them off of it afterwards. It was a recovery, took a week or ten days before she recovered enough to be able to come back home. I had a nice car up this side of the head, kind of shaped like a light bulb, and they put a stereo tape on it off.Lighted keyboard sterile. The nice part about heading back was we go to the airport and I'd sit in a chair and I I'd sicced so that that side of my life maybe HED was toward the ticket counter and my wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say my husband's head, some brain surgery and he's not feeling very sick. And is there any possibility that we can move up to first class? And everybody would take a look at me, slumped over looking half dead. This big scar running up the side of my head. We got moved off first class and every slight kind of neat, but my wife is clever and she does things like that."

Grab the loaf of bread. Take it out on twist, to twist time. Take out to slap em. Put the twist-tie back on, put the bread back in the freezer, close the door, grab a plate, out of the cupboard, and get the knife out of the Civil War. Now, go to the cabinet and get the peanut butter. Bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter. Go to the refrigerator. And grabbed the jar jelly, put the jar jelly on the counter. I opened up the peanut butter, take a knife. Grab some peanut butter on the knife, spread it on the bread, put them put the peanut butter on the whole slice of bread.One side and put the lid back on the peanut butter. Open up the jar of jelly, take the knife and take the other slice of bread and spread the jelly on the second slice. It never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter, because it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with. So put the put the jelly on the other slice of bread and you find it because the brake it's frozen, it's easier to spread. Both the peanut butter and jelly after you spread the peanut butter and the jelly slime, the two sides together, turn them over like this, cut them in half or quarters, you can cut on the diagonal, you can cut crosswise, you can cut vertical, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want. If you have a five-year-old grandson, you cut them into about eight pieces off. After you've cut up, well, you go to put a peanut butter, back in the cupboard, put the jelly back in the refrigerator and put the knife in the dishwasher it and now go get a class, pour yourself Club.Milk, take the peanut, butter sandwich, peanut butter, jelly sandwich, and the milk sit down at the table.

Space was a The cubicle. I don't know how to describe it. You have your linen closet and then underneath the limited linen, closet was an open area and which had a choice.Area inside of it, to get to the plumbing at the bathtub and we use that open area for a dirty clothes hamper, except it wasn't a in there and for a reason I don't remember the children. Told me that there was a big animal looking out of this. Area.So I'm thinking well children, but nevertheless, I close the bathroom door, so this animal couldn't get out. And then we, we went outside and we saw a raccoon or possum, I'm not sure. The difference was, it's big claws looking out at us from the air vents, I guess you call us that are in theFoundation of a house. And that really scared me. I thought of that thing gets in the house or gets out. It can fight the kids and it might be rad rabid. So I called the dead animal shelter. I think it was told me that they everybody was on lunch. And so they wouldn't be there for an hour, which I blew my stack and told them that I wanted someone there now because if someone gets bit, I will say that the city. So somebody came out and the men were not happy to see the possum either with you really look mean and they took off the vent and somehow they caught him and then they discovered, I believe this they discovered a nest of baby passes which all it can be ridiculed when their baby there.

And after the man climbed in the tree, his letter fell down, a dog came along in this barking up the tree and the Spider-Man come with a ladder to rescue the man and I'm assuming everything ends up. Okay, the end. Well, the most recent episode is a broken bone was, it's not a big deal. IHad been having pain in my left foot more. I walked more it hurt but I really just kind of ignored it. I was more concerned about my right foot with the toenail looking back. It was lifting off the bed and I didn't quite know what to do about this. So I made a appointment with the foot doctor, but my foot doctor is in Waukegan, Illinois off. And let's see, how did that work? Oh boy.We came we came directly from, we had been on a cruise and we had visited our children in in Orlando, and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan. So I could see the foot doctor. And me and I don't remember what happened. But anyway, when I finally got to the foot doctor, she just off explained that the reason that nail was lifting office because when she had removed the ingrown toenail a new nail was growing underneath. So she just took the top nail off. Took a half a minute that was done. And then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting. And so of course she feeling it and found the very painful spot in that led to x-rays. Which showed there was a small broken bone, and which led to my having to wear a boot for a month and then come back for more x-rays. So I came back to Arizona, then I turned around and month went back to Waukegan more x-rays on the stupid thing is not healed yet which is dead.Usual for me cuz this whole scenario happened once before and she says, another month with the boot and to do ultrasound treatments every day and I forgot to do it. No, I did it yesterday. And she also told me that when I came back, when I would be coming back, the end of this month, she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else. And of course, she's following him and nice thing about visit is really like that put doctor as a person and she's pregnant and she's going to have her second child, mess up. That was real nice. But anyway, I said, well, since you're not going to be here in a month, I will get a foot doctor in Arizona. So, that's where I am. Now, I'm waiting game is stupid foot to heal. The end."

And these children have traumatic brain damage or they're severely disabled where they're they barely can function. They're usually in, they are in wheelchairs, all their ADM are done for them. They're they don't communicate at all verbally. And so basically, the only way that you can communicate with them, a lot of is by their affect, by the way, maybe their eyes, how their eyes are turning in or out. Or if they're looking at you with the way that you touch them, maybe just communicating some of them. Well, wageI have several classes, there's another class that's m o m d which is a little more advanced and so in that class we communicate by sign language like this would be a you know please or you know something like this like the doctor the nurse. So sometimes we do sign language with those kids and we can communicate with them that way. McKay the beginning of the story. It looks like there is this little girl. Oh. Probably between eight and ten year old little girl and somehow, I don't know how she got into a raging River, but it looks real cold. And the firemen are paramedic, is coming to rescue. Her boss has all his equipment on, and basically, he has to go out into this raging River, and he's grabbing onto some kind of a tree, limb, a branch or something for his support. And then he's got some kind of a builder, something to, to pull her in order to help her off, to help her in, but he's also out there and in danger, in his life, too.Okay there's this little boy probably ten twelve years old and he's out playing soccer, just having a really fun time and the ball goes through Thursday, possibly maybe the neighbor's window, or maybe it's his own front window, and the ball lamp are knocks over a lamb. So actually it breaks the window glass and also a lamp and the man was sitting in a chair and then he picks up the ball and he looks up the window and that's all in those pictures are. So, I don't know what the end of the story is. I don't know, the little boy, does the I love this one because this is typical typical with kids and mothers, okay? So the little boy, is getting ready to go to school. He has a backpack on and his mom says, I think it's going to rain today. We take the umbrella umbrella, and the low ball games. No, I'm not going to take it. It's not going to rain.Trust me. Okay. Kids think they're smarter than the parents, but they're not. And the mom says you need the umbrella. But he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside and it starts to ring haha. And so the little boy comes back home and he's, he's soaking wet and he comes back in and his mother is a little upset with them because in her mind, she says, I told you. So why don't you listen to me? And he's sopping wet. And so, he takes the Umbrella song goes to school and I help you learn to listen to always listen to your mom."

She was very sad cuz she thought there was no way that she could ever go, but the mice, and the birds that Cinderella was friends with for actually magic mice and birds off. They knew how to sew, and they knew how to accessorize, and they knew how to design dresses apparently. So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella, and she was so surprised and so excited.Then she went to the wall and at the ball, she met the prince and it was just love at first sight. The way it should be home of her and she loved him and they had a wonderful time dancing. And Then her sister saw her and were very, very upset that she was there and they were pulling her dress, and they were tearing her scars and they chased her away and made her go home. Then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry. And so he sent out a message to all the houses in the land saying, he wanted to come because he had found the magic slip off the glass slipper that she had left, and he was looking for because he knew that the foot that went in, with the slipper, belonged to the girl. I wanted to marryBut the evil stepmother and stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot. That goes in the magic silver. So the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out. And then the prince did find her. And then they got married. And then the King was happy and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters the end."

She was writing circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them. The little kitty, got scared and ran up into the tree and Little Sally was worried about the cat. So she went and found a ladder. She was going to put the ladder up by the tree. One of the young man walked by and said, oh no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get the cat out of the tree at which point the dog came back and scared the man and he ran up into the tree.Little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree so she had to call the full the firemen so that they could come and rescue everybody. I will tell you about having my tonsils out the Christmas. I had had strep throat five times in one year, and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to have to come out. Which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult and I still had them at all. So my sister came into town to stay with me during that week while I wasGoing to be getting them out and I had to go to Scottsdale, think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done, but they did it like on a day surgery. But what I remember about most is a it hurt but my surgery was scheduled at like 11:30 in the morning but I could not have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there, I was like a little bit dehydrated. So they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me off like six times in order to get the IV in and that was very, very unpleasant. They they finally got it in took me into both the little hospital room and I remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, oh that's going to be great. You're going to give me drugs and I'm listening.The Pink Floyd. So this is going to be a good day. So did that laid down on the gurney? They gave me the Ivy. And then the next thing I remember I was waking up in a recovery in my throat. Her, it was painful. I felt I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurts so bad. They were to give me like some water to help kind of soothe at my throat and I couldn't swallow it. So it was coming back out of my nose. It was just, it was a mess, it was horrible, but the whole thing probably took like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out, but it was like, twelve hours of torture for that. And that was the Friday before Christmas, that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popping off.Goals you know people are like oh you always get ice cream and get ice cream but I'm lactose intolerant. So I can't have ice cream so that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because I thought it was hurt. It was burning my throat and it was probably It was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that and I've had people ask me, you know, if you had to do it all over again, I was I I'd have just I just continue to hash out throat. That's what other continue to do."

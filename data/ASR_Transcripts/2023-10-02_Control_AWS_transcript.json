What I do is probably um not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive aggressive with her and it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't want to know anything and I'm like fine or, you know, I just walk away. Usually a little bit later she will know that she somehow impacted. I, I think she knows she has hurt me in some way that she knows she's now withholding the information and that my walking away is is because she knows I want more and because I care, it's like we have to go through a dance. It's like this dance to get a little bit more information. Um God I do it because anything I can get, I'll take thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. Um, it can be happy or sad.

It was, I would say, um, every Sunday, just about every Sunday, there were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday and it was the highlight of my week. My grandparents, uh, my mom's parents, um, we just everything that I wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple and his willingness to be chivalrous. But my grandma had her own mind. It's like he at that time was able to, to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play, but he did it. And so it was really important for me. Um, because I just lived with or I just had my mom at home, um, to see this really healthy dynamic between two people and everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there. My grandpa would have, uh, he always had a handful of nuts. Um, because there was a squirrel named Pete who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now, I'm sure it wasn't just one PD, there were probably 20 P DS, but I thought it was PD and I just always called a PD. And so we would feed PD and then we would go inside and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of, um, dinner, uh, late afternoon ish dinner and it was always fancy, like high noon kind of dinner. And, you know, everything was always homemade and wonderful. And she laid out the table so beautifully and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that.

But she had two daughters and Cinderella, who had been the joy of her mother and father was suddenly relegated to the Cinders and she had to do all the chores for her two stepsisters and her stepmother didn't think much of her either. So she just had a terrible time. And then there was in this kingdom where Cinderella lived, there was a uh a king and he decided that it was time for his son to get married. So he sent out an edict that all the eligible young, attractive women in the in the kingdom would come for a ball and they would have a ball on a certain night. And so the invitations went after all and sundry and he came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two step sisters and they were all eligible, but her two steps were not very pretty. So, but they got really excited and they got, oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes and marvelous, this marvelous that. And Cinderella got excited too and she thought it would be just great, but she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball and she would have to help her sisters get ready. And so the night came and they got themselves ready and they went off in a carriage and they were, you know, looking, looking down their nose at her and she was ready to cry. And all of a sudden a fairy godmother showed up, I touched her and she turned into this beautiful dress and then there was a pumpkin and she turned that into a coach and then there was some mice and she turned that into the horses. And she made this beautiful thing for this, for this Cinderella who wasn't going to get to go to the. And she had these lovely little glass slippers. But she said the one thing you cannot stay out after midnight. So when the clock starts to strike, you've got to leave, you've got to go before the clock starts to strike. So she went to the bar and when she got there, the prince saw her and he looked, took one look and he just Canada. And so he found her and everybody else just had to stand back and wait because that's all he could do was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found and they danced and they danced all over the place and everybody else was sort of put to the side and, but you know what? She forgot that she had to leave at midnight. So the clock starting to strike and she remembered, so she started flying down the step to leave, but she lost the slipper and she flew out the door. And by this time, her carriage had turned into a pumpkin and her horse had turned into mice. But she finally got home. I've forgotten exactly how, but she got home and there she was by the again, but in the cinders by the fireplace and the other two daughters came home, of course, they had the story to tell. But along came an envoy from the kingdom and he said, we're trying to find the girl who belongs to the slipper.

Everybody cries, everybody love her mother, her father and his grief and in his worry about Cinderella, having a mom goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures. Um He brings them all home to his lovely manor where they uh immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father, partly out of heartbreak and partly out just a really bad diet. Also dies. Uh At this point, the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy. They make her run around working all the time and they begin mocking her for being dirty and they call her Cinderella. Now, their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all of the other brides and the adjoin all the other potential brides and princesses and the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people or perhaps he's commanded to hold the ball and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this. They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns. Um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go to just to get out of the house. Have a bit of flavor. Uh But of course they won't let her because they, they tell her that she would be an embarrassment, but mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball and uh Cinderella is left alone, sort of broken hearted and downcast and basically an empty house and she begins crying, she's just crying and crying about a fireplace. When all of a sudden a woman materializes from the flames and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says I just, I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, oh, well, I am your fairy godmother and is within my power to grant this. So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and uh some frogs? And um you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers. And so that will do and she waves her wand and the pumpkin turns into a carriage and her, her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ball gown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass. None nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into uh horses and coachman and Cinderella is just overcome with joy and, and she gets into the carriage and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairy godmother says, unfortunately, my magic power is limited. And at midnight when the the chimes go, uh everything will turn back. So make sure that you are well away from the ball and, and out of uh you know, an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens. Cinder says I will, I will and she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball and she arrives and it's even more dazzling than she thought and she comes in and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming. And uh in the midst of, of her being greeted by, by throngs of enchanted admirers, the prince looks up and he sees her and he asks her to dance and they begin to dance and of course they're both super hot. So they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together. Uh and the princess is about to propose to her there and then on the spot and the clock begins to strike 12 and she says, oh, no.

And so she cleans the place with all the help of the woodland creatures who like the way she sings like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know. I think bumper shows up. Um, so she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling and then she yawns and falls all across the bed. There are seven of them and she just falls all across them and it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there and about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work. They work in the mines. There is dark happy grumpy, dopey bashful. It's easy to this have been taught to be sleepy, sleepy, sleepy the seventh. Ok. So there are those seven dwarfs and they work in the mines, gathering precious gems and whatnot. And they come a marching home because of course it's their home. There are seven little beds for seven little dorms and they enter their home and they see this strange woman passed out across their beds, probably went to one too many parties. They don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that. Um, and so she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent looking, the dorms are all like, yeah. Ok. I believe you, you can stay with us as long as you're in danger, as long as you keep cleaning up the place and like make her food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she's cool with that. And so she lives with them happily for some time. And then the evil queen has been sitting smug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day she saunters up to the magic mirror and she says the mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says still, still snow white, still, you didn't kill her. And the evil queen flies into a rage and she decides if you're gonna do something, right? Do it yourself. She probably kills the Huntsman. She probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. Um So she goes down to her layer where she makes all her potions because as an evil queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white apple into and pulls it out and it is red as blood and it is of course, a poison apple because that is how she rolls and she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples. Hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking. I would indeed it, that probably means that it's been genetically modified. Um, but then she disguises herself as this old crone and she marches off into the forest. I'm not, I don't remember how she found snow white, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the doors are off to work and snow white is sitting in the house singing at her animal friends probably. And Snow White answers the door and says, oh, look an old crone with a magically delicious looking apple. I'm probably completely safe. And the older Cron says, would you like an apple child? And she says, yep, still safe. And she takes the apple and the croon says, yes, child eat the apple."}, {"segment_name": "richardson36_270024_509940.wav", "aws_transcription": "OK. Very good. Um All right. So now I'm going to present another picture series here. Um I want you to take these are another set of um pictures that tell a story, take a look at all of them and then I'm gonna ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Um And you can look at these pictures as you tell a story. All right. So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella and he didn't want to take it because he didn't believe it rained. So where I had to start walking outside, it started raining and he gets mad and is stomping through the puddles, wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house wet and gets umbrella, then continues on his journey. Great. So here's another picture. Um I want you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree, her father thought he could rescue the cat. So he brought a ladder, placed it on the branch and climbed up and then his ladder fell. So he stuck up in the tree with the cat. And for some reason, the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out. So they had to call the fire department and the fire department came in the fire departments on their way to rescue them, to rescue the cat and the father. And I said, ok, great, thank you. Ok. So now, um I'm gonna have you. This is again another story this is, have you ever heard of Snow White? I've heard of that. That that's fine. Um Take your time to look at the pictures to tell a story. I want you. Oh, wait, sorry. Um You know, the pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm gonna take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures and then ask you to tell me the story in your own words. I I think Jam All right. So, so, um, now just tell me as much of the story as snow white as you can. And you can use any details that you know, prior or what you just look at what I looked at. So there was this queen who was hoping she'd be the most, the fairest lady of the land. All right. And so she'd asked her magic mirror which had a face in it and she'd ask who's the fairest lady of the mall. And usually the mayor would reply. She is. But one day the mayor replied, Snow White is. So the queen was upset and banged Snow White. And then Snow White was going through the forest and she found seven dwarfs. And for some reason, she fell asleep, but they thought she was gone and dead."}, {"segment_name": "UNH1039_1262876_1502778.wav", "aws_transcription": "OK. So Cinderella once upon a time, um there was a girl named Cinderella or Ella and then I think they added the Cinder because she was dirty or something because she had to clean anyway. So there's this girl and she had a family and her father was a little well off and then her mother ended up dying. And so her father, her father remarried a woman, the evil stepmother who had two daughters, Anastasia and maybe, I don't know, I remember they had like longer kind of mouthful names. And so they ended up moving in and like the two sisters, they bicker a lot and the, the step mom didn't like Cinderella and then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil stepsisters. And uh this is so weird to tell it. Um And so then the evil stepmother was like, you're just gonna be a maid in the house because she didn't really like her. So she like exiled her to like a room in the attic. And that made her pretty much a servant. And one day the prince prince charming announced that he was having a ball, I think in order to look for a wife or something like that and the steps sisters or the stepmother really wanted the step sister to go. The step sister wanted to go too because they wanted to go meet the and have their shot at him to see if they can marry him. And Cinderella was like, oh, cool. Maybe I'll go and the stepmother was like, yeah. No. Yeah. And so I think Cinderella has her animal accomplices. I know one. The name is Gus. Gus. I don't remember the other one and her animal and the birds and stuff, the singing birds, they make like a dress for her. She's like looking through, I think it was her mom's stuff. So she gets an old dress of her mom's and then they make it all pretty and stuff for her. And so she's getting ready to go to the ball and she walks downstairs to go out and the sisters and the stepmother, like, rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry. Um, because they don't want her going and I think maybe they locked her in a room or something. I don't know how she ends up getting out. But anyway, she ends up going to the bar or sneaking out to the bar getting ready to go. And then fairy godmother of appears, ok, she doesn't try to see out. The fair godmother appears first and then it's like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess. And then she turns her gown into like this beautiful ball gown. She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods and the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into a carrot and like her animal friends turn into horses. And so then she goes to the fall, she makes this late grand entrance and the prince is like very fascinated with her. And so they have a dance. But one of the conditions of this magic from the fairy godmother was that it expires at midnight. So she's dancing with him and the clock strikes like symbolized that the time or like midnight is coming into."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto44a_1521526_1761360.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok, Cinderella, who lived in a house with her two sisters and her evil grandmother and poor Cinderella because she was the baby of the family. I always got stuck with doing all the chores. And that didn't matter if she was out tending the animals out in the barn or feeding the dog or slapping the hogs and even having to cook all the meals. And her two older sisters, they just had to run to the house. They just got to go to all the parties and uh play around the way they wanted to do. And no matter what Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, your grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters. Well, every year they have this large dance in town and it's to celebrate uh just the, the harvest and all of that type of stuff. So they have this big party and everybody gets dressed up and there's all kind of uh food and dancing and so forth and Cinderella has never been able to go, I mean, she's just always shunned her because she's just the dog sort of as far as the even grandmother knows. So the two sisters come along and they get all dressed up and they're off to the party. Well, they're having such a wonderful time and poor Cinderella is at home and, uh, she sort of beside herself. But all of a sudden a fairy godmother appears to her and says, Cinderella, why are you sitting at home? And he says, well, I don't have a dress and I have no preparation. You know, my grandmother hates me. My sisters hate me and I'm never allowed to go anywhere. So the f godmother says, well, we're going to fix that today and I'm going to get you a new gown and in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So he, she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown and uh gets all these fancy shoes and I think her, her feet were made out of like glass slippers. They were probably like a, a rock crystal. So she gets transported to the dance and me and her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, you know, with the king and the queen and the prince being there, the prince uh just is really impressed with this Cinderella joke. And uh so they dance and they dance and they dance and they dance and the day seems to go by so quickly. But all of a sudden uh Cinderella hears the clock ringing and the bells start chiming and she remembers that her fairy godmother said that boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight or you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person and all of this stuff is going to be washed away and everybody will know that it's just like a boy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from and in the process loses one of her shoes, but she does manage to get home and her fairy godmother collects up all of her garb and everything."}, {"segment_name": "richardson21_881144_1120959.wav", "aws_transcription": "And the mice, the brave little mice who have been turned into horses and chased by cats and made her a dress that got ripped to shreds. Still somehow find it within their little mousy hearts to go down and steal the key to the room. Cinderellas locked in from the evil stepmother and they bring it up to her after much trial and error. And Cinderella unlocks the door. She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsister's feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass swept up and everyone panics because the steps sisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the prince is dancing with. Obviously, that's the only reason they can't prove that. And the advisor is panicking because king wants the prince to get married. The prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says, but wait, I have the other sliver and lo and behold, she does, in fact have the other slipper which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why fairy godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes and she shows the slipper to prove that it is, in fact the matching slipper and then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot. I don't think she should be able to stand in real life and puts it on her and it fits beautifully, of course. And so there was triumphant music and they all looked happily ever after the princess. No, Cinderella, she wasn't a princess yet. Had to get the ring. First. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind and married the prince probably still doesn't know her name. The N the N All right. That's awesome. Is that too long? No, that's great. Ok. Ok. So now I'm gonna have you do the same type of thing? Oh, excellent. But there's no white. Ok. Ok. So again we covered up all of the type. So to look through the pictures and the less comprehensive knowledge of snow whites, this will probably be shorter. That's fine. I right. She's very melodramatic. Look at this. Look at this. What is this face? I mean, I get that she's panicked but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances. All right. So, so there's no way from the seven doors was told by somebody who vaguely remembers that. Ok. Ok. So, hm, now I'm not sure if Snow White was actually a princess or something before the evil queen usurped her throne or if like, she's the beautiful cousin or something. And we're just waiting for the evil queen to die off before she Snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there's this evil queen, she's got the high regal cheekbone. She could probably be nice looking if she wasn't so evil. So I don't know what she's so insecure about, but Snow White is the fairest in all the land."}, {"segment_name": "wright73a_1223620_1463420.wav", "aws_transcription": "Well, once upon a time there was this woman that had two of her daughters and a third one that was like a maid.

And, uh, whenever she would come in with some tea or coffee, not tea because it was in a pot, uh, some tea, they would bring it, she would bring it to them and they would make fun of her because she was not dressed like they were. And, uh, then they didn't even want it because they didn't feel like having it then. So they complain. And she liked, according to the pictures that I sort of remember, she liked little animals. She's like the mace. She liked the horse. She liked the dog, the cat and she found peace with them. She got along with them. And, uh, finally there was one time that someone brought her a dress, a man was relative, I guess. And she tried it on, she looked very pretty and the sisters were jealous. They didn't want her to have that dress. She did, she looked lovely, but they didn't want to admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, hm, I have to watch you. So that was that. But then they took the dress away and then by and by they hear that they're going to have a big ball at this palace and they got some kind of written notice on it. And so the mother says to the two, the three of them heard it together, the little girl that was mistreated and the two stepsisters, they all heard they're all very happy. And so, uh, she, uh, says, ok, we're gonna get you dressed up in the most beautiful dresses and make sure that you get the prize because I understand that he's looking for a woman. So they, the, she, the, uh, the mother gets the two stepdaughters dressed up as best she could. In the meantime, Cinderella went up to the attic and she looks through some of the things that were there and she finds a little book with a picture and a dress, a beautiful dress. Uh, and she says that's nice. Now, the four mice are there and they say they could hear her. She says that, that, that would be nice. I would like to have that dress and they make it for her, they make it for her. So she puts it on. She looks beautiful. She has beads, she has a sash and she has, uh, no, that, that what, what, what they showed. And, uh, then when the time came that they were to go, she came down because they were dressed up. So she was dressed up now in this dress and they looked at her and she did look beautiful in it, but they tore the beads off, tore the sash off, took off her dress says you're not going to that party only we because we look better and we'll win. And the mother is going right along with everything. So he says, you go to your room and take care of what you have to and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time. So she goes back in her room and she's very sad. And uh her fairy godmother comes along and says, Cinderella, why are you crying?

So Cinderella was an only child and she, I I guess her father uh got remarried to a woman who became her stepmother. And this woman had two daughters of her own and they quickly moved into Cinderella's house and overtook the house and I do forget what happened to the dad, but he went off and it was just Cinderella, the two stepsisters and the stepmother and the stepmother and the stepsisters used Cinderella as a maid and they renamed her to Cinderella because of Cinders and all the cleaning and she was dirty and they told her how she wasn't pretty and she was really truly much prettier than her mean evil stepsisters. And um the what would you call it? The town, the region decides the prince is gonna have a ball. And the two sisters come home and her, their mom and they're very excited because there's going to be a ball and all the young women of the lands are invited and the um two sisters start planning their outfits and the mothers involved and it, and all assuming that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty. And uh the prince would never want to see her. So the night comes and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful, uh and off they go to the ball and I think the mother may have gone as well and she's left at home and she's sitting out in the garden and her fairy godmother appears and the fairy godmother has a chit chat with her and finds out she really does want to go. So the fairy godmother um uses her wonderful magic wand and then uses the help of the tiny little mice and the mice or puf become the um I don't know what you call it the uh chariot attendance. So the man of the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful and her dress, her hair is all done up. She's absolutely exquisite. She takes a pumpkin ba ba ba boom. The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot. The mice become the chariot people. They open the doors, they drive her off to the ball.

The fairy godmother says have a great time but you must be home by midnight because all this is gonna disappear the magic at midnight. So she goes off, she goes to the ball and the prince is dancing with everybody. And of course, he sees Cinderella who is by far the most beautiful in the room. He asks her to dance. They have many lovely dances and then all of a sudden she tunes into what time it is somehow and she says I must leave. He says no, no, no. And she's like, no, I really must go. She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight. She's running down the steps of the palace. She just gets into her um pumpkin chart. She leaves as she's running, she leaves a sandal step. Uh what you call it, a beautiful pump on the steps. She, as she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin. She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters. And they come home and say what a wonderful time. They kind of tease her for being stuck at home um and ask her what she did and they dream about what a wonderful time. And then it, everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind and he is going throughout the lands to find who's foot fits the slipper and it's a very delicate glass slipper. And so eventually they get to Cinderella's home, the two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it. Of course, it doesn't fit. Cinderella wants to try it.

So I was sort of surprised uh that I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound and I took my friend Dorothy with me. Um and the oncologist who was there uh said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with stage two cancer. So I called my sister who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff.

May June July. It takes many months to um compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer. And especially the first time they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they choose the best course of treatment. Um especially because I was 40 they view that as young. And so it's pretty radical. Um So anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests in months and months of agony and then ultimately have uh I have a bilateral lumpectomy. So they found it in both sides actually, after all the tests and that was removed, my surgeon at Northwestern was great, um very comforting and confident, which is what I needed. And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery, the medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation. And then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. Um So after I had my surgery, a week later, they put my port in and the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. Um So I went straight from the hospital over to uh the where they administer the, the drugs for chemo. And um I had treatment every other week for a couple of months and I recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful and you can taste them, you can smell them. Um But in your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells they are, they are doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that said that's, I guess how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing, being killed. Uh After my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation and that just made me tired. So that was ok. And then that was right. I, I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6th. My radiation ended just after Christmas. So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments.

I don't think there are rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing, but I think it's clinics, I think, but this is an old Postwar building and I believe it's two or three stories high and it was a women's hospital at the time, I had my first two Children. And the most amazing thing about this room, there were windows and a door with on, it was on the second floor and there was a, it's still there. If you go to the Riley Garage, you can see it.

And she says, oh, I want to go, I'm eligible maiden and says, of course you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done. So she makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do. She says, wash the floor and someone says, well, I washed the floor yesterday. She says we'll do it again and she had to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball. And as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons. And when they're done, she goes upstairs in the attic and finds a dress a, an old trunk that used to be her mother's. And she shows them, I use her beautiful dress and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away. And she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress. But the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL39-2_21554_261148.wav", "aws_transcription": "Another injury. All right. So last time I'm gonna tell you, we'll see. Last time we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So, since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult. So I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother, I have an older brother and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then and the boys decided to shim me a tree to get the, to the top of a wheel, uh wheelchair. I've got wheelchair in my brain to get to the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed. But I was pretty scraped up from and I decided I didn't like following suit with the shimming of a tree. So they shimmed down. I was not gonna shimmy down. So my brother, but he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof and yes, I broke my foot. He helped me, um, hobble home and try to, my mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff. But no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast. So you had to stay propped for a little bit. But mine is that it was a walking cast. I was fine. That's what I remember of that. Hm. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating. But what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues or did I'm gonna have to tell the same story. So that's the special needs from the first Baptist church where I was their Sunday school teacher for 10 years and still go to ari with them for special needs retreat. Um It's a group of about 5 to 600 special needs of which many do not communicate. Um There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities which includes like the Big Square Dance. So you just help them whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they, um, have a hard time walking. Uh But most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate. Um, and hear over top of it. Uh, the three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers of which only one communicates. I mean, yeah, one communicates. The other two don't. It's a series of grunts, some sign language over the years. I've, of course, learned the girlfriend and this means one is engaged to Becca. Um, we have her wedding ring upstairs. Um He brings money in his pocket, that's his dowry so that he could pay for the wedding. Um He does not communicate but through his sign, it's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying. His, his sister and his mom usually knows that they are communicators, but it's just they're communicators for them, put it that way. Um They will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer and by facial expressions, you know."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto56a_141455_381040.wav", "aws_transcription": "This last spring, I was down in the basement doing some work and I decided to come flying up the steps and I flew it. But the problem was I had both hands full of papers and I didn't hold on to the brail, which I usually do. I'm used to be careful. So what fly around the corner and as I turned the corner and hit the third step out, I slipped and fell backwards and hit the wall and of course, I fell flat on the landing. There, I was, and I thought, well, I can get up, but I couldn't get up. There was no way I could get up. So there I was. And I, I guess I went in and out. I don't really remember, but I, there, I was on the landing and I couldn't get up and I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen and he's watching TV. And maybe I'll be able to get up later and I won't tell him. But I was so foolish just to come up the steps and fall. So I lay there a little bit longer and I woke up again and I, I couldn't get up. So I just lay there and I kept going in and out. And finally, some time later it was at least 30 minutes. He wandered by the door and the door from the, from the floor was up and down to the stairs. And so he looked at, and I said, what are you doing down there? And I said, I can't get up. And he said, well, that won't do. So he came down and he tried to get me up and I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done, but I couldn't, I couldn't move. So he said, we need to call the ambulance. And I said, oh, no, I'll be able to get up. And he said, we really ought to call the ambulance. But my next door neighbor was a urologist and her, his wife was a nurse and I said, well, maybe you can call them. So he called them and they came over and the, the doctor looked at me and he said, call the ambulance. So we called the ambulance and then we called my daughter who also lives in Lexington and she met us at the, she came to the house. And so, and the ambulance came to the fire truck came and we got us and they brought us, they, they brought them because I had a neck injury. Obviously I couldn't move my neck, couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body and they brought it in and from each side of me, these two big burly men working on either side of me trying to get me up and the, the landing wasn't all that wide. They finally got me up and they didn't want me to move it all. So they carted me up the stairs and I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about it ever since they said to each other, she hasn't weighed as much as a six. So this has been the joke with the whole thing. They got me up and we, they were absolutely marvelous on the way to the hospital. They kept telling me where they were and it wouldn't be too much longer because it really was in pain. And I got to the hospital and of course, they called ahead. They took me straight through to critical care and they were, they were ready for me and the rest of the night I was in and out. But I had marvelous care. I had marvelous. He told me work professionals who were working with me all night long and they kept trying to check and be sure I didn't have any brain damage. I didn't have any nerve damage, but I had a broken neck, the second cervical was broken. So they, they had, they had this cast on me the minute that they were there, they had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital.

Well, I've had a lot, um, my fair share, I guess, different but the most, uh recent, uh, was I discovered I had colon cancer last March and, um, discovered it quite by accident. I had been sick the whole month of February with the flu and it, when I finally got over the flu and been on several antibiotics, um, I still was running um, of low grade fever and being nauseated at night and, uh, went on for a little while but I, I still didn't think it was right. So I went back to the doctor. I think that was the fifth or sixth time I'd been in like 44 or five weeks. And, um, for whatever reason that he doesn't know and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy. Um, thought that was kind of unusual. I had a ticket to Cali plane ticket to California. And, um, so he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day and he did find a surgeon who would, and, uh, went in for the colonoscopy and, um, they kind of put you out and when I got up off the table. I said, well, did you find anything? And he said yes. And I said cancer. And he said yes. And I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said we'll talk about that Monday. And, um, so Monday, he explained to me the extent to what I had. Um, he thought it was contained within the colon but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. And, uh, so they scheduled the operation, believe it or not two weeks down the road. And I said, then I'm going to California, I'm not gonna sit around here and worry about this, you know, two weeks. I just couldn't believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer, they would schedule you two weeks down the road. Uh, the doctor called me that night and asked me some questions and we thought it was really unusual to have a doctor call you that didn't happen very often. The next morning, his nurse called me at seven from the hospital and they were doing surgery. She said we can get you in Friday if you'll stay. And I said, well, if you can get me on Friday, then I'll stay. So, um, I was scheduled for surgery Friday and had it and, um, they ended up taking my whole colon, although I left enough to hook everything back up, which was very fortunate. Um, but he thought he got it all, which of course is everybody's first question. And, um, so anyway, I was in the hospital, I don't remember. Um, I was on morphine and kind of out of it had trouble. I had a lot of trouble with my, uh, ID and I was on, like I said, I was on morphine. So the IV thing kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on war phone, I guess. But anyway, they would let that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring driving this long. I mean, they wait 15 minutes and it's like a car door, you know, the ding and, uh, I saw every time I would want to sleep, that thing would wake me up. Well, after a day of that I was ready to kill something and, um, they just wouldn't let it go even though we call them or whatever. They just take their sweet time getting in there.

She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than, than the, than the young girl that the, the man had. And uh when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the, the gentleman's daughter was really forced to do all the work in the house. And uh the uh daughters of the new wife who really got to sit around all day. And in fact, they um made Cinderella sleep in the near the fireplace or in next to the fireplace and she ended up being covered with uh ashes from the fireplace. So they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her time went on and Cinderella's only friends really were the animals in the household. All of them, including the uh dog and cat and mice and even the rats were her friends. And uh so time went on and they, they all grew older and they were in their probably late teens, maybe when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman. And the stepsisters were not quite so beautiful, partly because they were mean and nasty. Um So they lived in a, in a kingdom with a uh king who lived in a palace in the center of the city. And uh he had a son and the king wanted his son, the prince to marry. Well, the prince was, had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about. And the uh the prince or the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom. So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies of the kingdom would be invited. And uh uh he and the prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he'd like to marry. They helped the everybody received an invitation, the stepmother received their invitation and was of course, very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder. She was excited.

So, um, everybody was running around getting all, uh, prepared and finding dresses and finding hair dos and beautiful shoes. And finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball and Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find something that she herself could wear. Um, but of course she couldn't find much of anything great. And so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the stepsisters laughed at her and said, you can't go to the ball looking like that.

The first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japan. So um it was frustrating. Um I had to put Children in school, I had to take some shopping to get their forms. I had to take a taxi and tell them where I wanted to go and how to get at home. And so how did I deal with it? I studied Japanese uh every morning, five days a week until I got so I could do it happened again when I went to Korea, it happened again when I went to Guatemala. So, and, and, and in Brazil where they did not speak English, I spoke English in Jamaica and I spoke English in Malaysia at that time. But the only time that I really have what I call a serious communication problem is when I have been transported into a place where people don't speak my language and I have to communicate and I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time. And I find I do it by reading body language, uh reading facial expressions um and a lot of this, uh, moving hands and to describe what I want. And then as, as the language picks up on my part, I have less of that to do. That's pretty much my experience with that. Um Were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared? Yes. Ok. What happened? Tell me the story start from the beginning. Ok. I was on a boat, a ship I should say. And us s president of mine was President Wilson and we were sailing from, I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my, my husband and my two youngsters who were there. Uh They were probably 3rd and 4th grade and we came in, we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when the typhoon came. So, um the captain, you know, notified us there, there, the weather out there. And so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon started and the two of them met and our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. I was uh my Children, one of them was thrown out of uh her bunk and, you know, hit her head on a, on a, on a wash basin and I, we strapped them in something. I can't remember exactly because I was miserable. I was seasick and I was on the uh deck and they had storm windows up. So, because the problem you're supposed to be able to see, but they have these bad weather, big thick windows up. And I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair as I could be watching the waves come up over me and then I would hear crashing and when we would go up real high, the ship creek can go free and then go down. I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life. They had, uh, ropes, uh, for people. You know, if you had to go to the bathroom or something, you, you couldn't walk.

Uh, and that was, to me, it was probably the most difficult one that I had to deal with. Not because I didn't understand him, but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him. Um, but I also spent some time in Mexico and there's people down there that speak no English. So I've, you know, had to adapt and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish enough to get by, uh, things like, uh, um uh uh or, uh, you know, the important stuff, you know, uh, the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico and we were, at the time we've been discussing this and we were just standing in line at the movie theater and it just happened, the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel, which we had planned to go see, to go to the island of Cozumel. And you travel around there a little bit because there's some ruins there. It's a really nice place. Well, the, ok, in the group that was telling about their experience down there, uh, apparently was an ex marine or something. He was just perfectly built. Um, and he had, they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab, they had gotten near the port. I think they were doing one of the princess cruises or something. So they had come into port and had spent the day there and then they had to get back to the ship. So they hired a cab. Well, the cab starts going the other direction and he kept telling him no, no, no, no, you're going the wrong way. The port is over here, you know, you need to go back this way and he wouldn't stop. And he kept saying not to worry. I know shortcut, it's ok. And he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop and he and his wife just jumped out of the vehicle as it was moving and people in the neighborhood that they were, that they had jumped out into started screaming about yelling for the Federalis because they knew that there was an abduction that was underway. Uh, so here we are maybe a month away, not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this, we get there to Cozumel and as soon as you get off the ferry, uh there's all these cab drivers there and wanting to, you know, take you around the city around the island.

And Cinderella and their steps, her steps, we're very excited to go. Um However, Cinderella uh could not go unless she had finished all her chores. Her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish. And she said, Cinderella could only go if she had finished all her chores first. Um So, um by the time uh it came to go, um Cinderella had just finished in chores and had no time to um make a dress or prepare yourself to go. But unbeknownst to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsister's clothes and such that they had cast away because they didn't want it. Um So Cinderella was very happy um that they had the dress for her and while the, the stepmother and the stepsister did not expect her to be able to make it. Um Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress. Very happy to go. Then the step sisters began to realize that her dress is composed of things that they have kept away. Yeah, they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters and she went out to the yard and was crying and then the fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight. And she made her very beautiful and uh all that, but she warned her it would only last till midnight. And you know, she turned, you know, a pumpkin into a carriage and you know, transformed all these elements uh to make her look very beautiful. And so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince and uh I guess it was love at first sight and they were dancing together and, you know, he, he very much enjoyed his time with her and, uh, they were dancing outside and she saw the clock and she noticed it was almost midnight. So she went racing down the stairs, uh, leaving one of her glass slippers behind and she went racing out in the carriage and, uh, she actually didn't make it quite home. And, uh, when it started mid night and everything turned back to what it was. Pumpkin, the carriage turned back into a pumpkin and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her last slippers. And so this prince, um, after this happened, he was very interested in finding her, you know, he was, he wondered why she ran away. And so he, um, set out to search for her using the glass slip."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL11-1_506812_746277.wav", "aws_transcription": "And finally the mom called the fire department because she didn't know how to get the dad or the cat out of the tree.

So I'm gonna have you look at these pictures that tell a story. There's gonna be um several slides um that are just the pictures of the story. They are automatically going to advance after 30 seconds. But if you're ready to move on before 30 seconds, just say next. And I'll go to the next slide. Um at the end, there will be an opportunity for you to review any slides if you wish to have extra time to look at any slides. And then I'm going to sho stop sharing my screen with you and have you retell the story of Cinderella without looking at the pictures. Ok. So we can go ahead and start, just say next, if you're ready to move on next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next. All right. Do you want to go back and review any pictures or sites? No, thanks. All right. So now, um tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can, you can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it. Ok. So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters, but they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did. So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess. And the stepsisters were very excited about it. And so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and stepsisters said, oh, well, you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years. And it was a beautiful dress and she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball. And when her stepsister saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried and the stepsisters went off to the ball and along came Cinderella's very godmother and she said, oh, well, you can go to the ball and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters and Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball. She danced with the prince and had a wonderful time. But remember that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were. So she so sorry, that was my dad."}, {"segment_name": "richardson20_1002968_1242433.wav", "aws_transcription": "Wow, that's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. So what's, what's he do?

Like any sane person would do any sane person. You see a sleeping girl? No, nothing else works like kiss. I mean, you kiss her. If one or two things are gonna happen, she's either gonna wake up and slap you or one of three things wake up and slap you, wake up and just be like, whoa, what happened or wake just not wake up at all. You got three options. A 22 of them are good. It's a little rough but no, no worse off than it was before. We frankly didn't hurt anything. Ok. So now, um I'm gonna have you do the same thing with little red Rice, right? That was just a nice phone word. Ok. All right. And remember you can use anything that you remember as well as the pictures from your book, right? So Little Red Riding Hood's at her house with her mom and her mom's baking some muffins and bread and some snacks to, for little Red Riding Hood to take to her granny. So she, she's out playing with the animals while her mom's doing that. And then, uh, she gets a basket from inside and she's like, ok, well, I'm, I'm off to grannies. Well, while she's going off to her grandmother, she gets a little side drag playing with the animals. And, uh, she runs into this wolf and the wolf is like, hey, where are you, where are you going? And she's like, well, I'm going over here to my granny's house. So I got a basket full of goodies for her. So, like the wolf goes over and looks in the basket and she's like, hey, leave that alone. That's not for you. And so the looks like, hm, if I get there first, maybe I can get these goodies. So the wolf runs on her head and gets to granny's house and like, knocks on the door and granny comes and answers the door and the, it's a wolf. So, I mean, she, she runs off, she's scared. But the looks like I have an idea. And so he dressed up in one of granny's nightgowns and put on a sleeping cap and grabbed your glasses and crawled into the bed. And, um, the little red riding hood gets to the door and knocks and the wolf disguises its voice is, like, come on in sleep and, and so the little red Riding Hood is like, oh, ok. Granny. And she opens the door and shuts the basket down. She's like, granny. Are you feeling? Ok? Yeah, maybe. So, she goes a little bit closer."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL11-2_246799_486255.wav", "aws_transcription": "Uh let me talk about when I went to Belgium as a cultural exchange student, which was I would say kind of life changing. When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio and I had the opportunity to travel as part of the International Foreign Youth Exchange, which is a 4h associated organization. And I was big in, in 4h when I was young because I grew up in Ohio. So grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity, Ohio, the state of Ohio sends uh several people every year to go to a foreign country and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others. And it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up. So I always knew that I wanted to do that. And since I had taken French all through high school, I thought I will go to a French speaking country and France wasn't available, but Belgium was so I chose Belgium and luckily I got to go there, I soon found out that learning uh high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium. So it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting and that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well. Uh Because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English. So I had to learn French and that's the best way to learn it I think. But it, it was that when I say it was life changing, it really kind of made me think about, first of all that other people are not like us in the United States. And really got me thinking about how can I do what I do um, as a speech pathologist in other countries. So I immediately came home and interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist. And they said, well, you got to get your master's degree back then. You, you didn't have to have your master's degree and in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my master's and met my husband, got married, had Children and that kind of thing. But it's always been something I had a private practice. Uh when I was teaching as a full-time professor and um did some, a lot of international work that way. So I was doing Telep practice before. It was cool actually. And I got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and, and that kind of thing. So, still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. Uh I still keep in touch with my, some of my host families in Belgium and we've hosted kids from other countries for, for other programs as well. So, you know, I think, uh, and I always encourage my Children, I hope they will get to, um, if not study abroad and, uh, travel a little bit more than I did growing up. It, it just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it. Now, these pictures also tell a story, take a look at them, tell me a story with a beginning, middle and end. And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face. Take a look at these pictures that tell a story. Um I'll ask you to tell me a story also with a beginning, middle and end and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mother said, oh, you definitely need to take your umbrella to."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL14-1_1389702_1629144.wav", "aws_transcription": "So once upon a time, there was um a very wicked lady who had three daughters and one day her husband, I think um adopted or, or brought in a new child into the household. And the sisters or the sister, the, the three sisters did not like this new child and they commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and task and do their laundry and sweep the floors. But she consoled herself in her friendship with animals and be it horses or dogs or even mice. Um She was very friendly to animals. And so what she didn't, what love she didn't get from her sisters or, or the sisters in the household she got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks. Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold, hold, hold um a ball and, and the household was invited to the ball. So Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited. But her sisters told her differently. And furthermore, they told her that she was not, not only not invited, but she was not appropriately dressed or could not, did not have a dress that would suit the occasion. So they left for the bald and Cinderella was very, very sad, but here comes the fairy, the godmother fairy and says, what would you like to do my child? And she says I would like to go to the ball. So, but I don't have a dress and the fairy said, no problem. We're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand. And Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes. Not only that but also a carriage that was gonna take her to the ball. So she goes to the ball and impresses everybody including the the prince, the king's son, um who falls desperately in love with her. But the theory had said you must be back by midnight or you're gonna turn into a pumpkin. So, Cinderella hurries back and makes it back before midnight, but leaves behind a shoe. So the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry. But where was she? She would know where to, to see him. So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe and they had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfectly. And they went through the sisters and even the mother tried her luck, but the shoe would not fit. And so no candidate was found to marry the Prince until one of the animals told the uh surveyor that she should try it on Cinderella. And when the surveyor did that, the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly. So the Prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball. And they lived happily ever after.

So you get two slices of bread."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL15-2_1172558_1411952.wav", "aws_transcription": "In the beginning of the story. Uh Cinderella and her father, we're moving to a new house and he was getting a new wife, uh who would be Cinderella's stepmother. Uh Her stepmother had two little girls uh that were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat and Cinderella had a dog and Cinderella uh thought everything could be good and her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up, the stepsisters uh really were not nice to Cinderella. They were evil stepsisters. Uh They did things like they made her do all the chores, they throw things at her, then make her clean the floors, clean it, send her out of the fireplace that make her take care of all the animals, including their cat and their cat didn't like Cinderella. So that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were mice. So that was kind of a tough thing to do. Uh Cinderella obviously was sad. So every night she would go to her room and she'd look out her window and she could see in the distance she could see the palace and she looked at the palace and says, oh, I wish I could go there someday just to see what it's like. So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Um Well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king and his right hand man uh would go through and try to figure out what, what was needed because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well, he had a son who was a prince, but the prince did not have a wife and he wanted the prince to have a wife before. Uh, he would give him the kingdom. So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the, the village. And they sent out invitations to everybody and the stepmother got the invitation and was reading it and Cinderella read it over her back over her shoulder and Cinderella thought, well, I'm a girl in the village. I get to go and her stepmother didn't say anything but her stepsisters were no way you can't go, gotta have a, gotta have a ball gown. So she did her ball gown. Uh, she didn't have a ball gown that is. So she went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of, um, ball gowns that she could have. And she talked to her friends, the mice and they took a dress that she had and they put bows and frills on it. And things like that and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need. I can go. Now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave. And when they saw her dress, they were upset. And one of the steps sisters ripped her dress and one of them ripped her necklace off of her And of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset."}, {"segment_name": "richardson21_1668821_1908210.wav", "aws_transcription": "And no, I thinks to herself. Yep. I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all and she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite and then she collapses and the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm gonna be real. The first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like I can only like get a wedge out and then from there I can take proper bites, but apparently Snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as in human beauty. So anyway, she collapses the apple rolls out of her hand. The chrome cackles maniacally as you all want to do and runs out. And then, I mean, I assume she like hobbles out because she's still a Cron. Maybe she, no, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway. But anyway, the old crow hobbles away and all the dwarves come hoeing home and they see Snow White passed out on the floor and they're like, again, but then they realize that she's not breathing too well or at all. And so they get on the backs of deer, I think, like they ride deer to go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this. Crone. Presumably, she just leaves a really obvious trail, but they follow her and I don't know, there's a, there's a lightning storm or something, I think. And the crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer. Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her and like they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car specifically and I believe it, I've seen it happen. It's terrifying. Um, but anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded men riding them. And so she's understandably freaked out and she climbs up onto this mountain and she's trying to hang on to the edge because she's about to fall and then lightning strikes the stick she's holding on to and the ground beneath her feet crumbles and she falls presumably to her death, but probably not for sure. In case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development. They did that in Rapunzel in, in, uh, tangled mother go is probably dead. Hope she's dead. She was scary. Um, so the evil queen as the crone falls to her death and all the dwarfs were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on snow white. And so they race back to snow white, but she is still dead. And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical again. But this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin and they're mourning her and there are flowers and tears and three wilde beasts crying. And suddenly the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion and he says, what the heck the pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm gonna kiss her because that is the logical next step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her and she wakes up, I assume she like just hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple and took it out of her mouth and that was censored. That seems logical because if he's gonna kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Um, go big or go home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so she sits up and thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her because otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again because she does that a lot."}, {"segment_name": "wright89a_571113_810501.wav", "aws_transcription": "Once upon a time, there is a little girl named Cinderella and she lived with her dad. Her mom had died years ago. So it was just her herself and her dad. And then one day her dad remarried and brought the new mom with two step sisters home to meet Cinderella. And Cinderella was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom. Well, Cinderella and her dad really loved each other and they were a family again with a new mom and, and two stepsisters. But then Cinderella's dad died and the step mom was not a very nice mom and the steps sisters were not very nice to Cinderella. And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes and scrub the floor and make the beds and make the food. And they would not let Cinderella be part of the family and they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all her, all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there and she would look out her window and she could see far beyond the city, the castle and she would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would want to go and see. Well, meanwhile, there was the prince and the prince wasn't married yet and the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom. And so they decided to make a uh do a ball, which is a big dance and they were gonna make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in the town come to the ball. And so the prince could pick one of the sisters or one of the uh single girls to be his wife. And so they sent out invitations and every home got an invitation for this big dance and everybody was invited. And so the stepmother and the two step sisters, they were so excited to go to this dance and they were gonna dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family too. And the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you. You're shabby and you don't have any clothes to wear. And the stepmother said, if you do all your chores, you can go. And, oh, Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball. And so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball and so they made her a dress and it, oh, it looks so pretty. So the night of the ball, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball and they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done. And here comes Cinderella and she comes down the stairs and she goes, oh, wait for me. I can go too. And the stepsisters and the step mom looked at her and they were appalled. They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear and they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her and they go, Cinderella. You can't go look at you. You look like and you look like a little merchant and no prince would ever want to look at you. And so they said you, they were off to the ball."}, {"segment_name": "richardson22_537900_777280.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. So, so the story of Cinderella is that her mom died and her dad remarried this really, really mean woman who had these really, really terrible daughters. And so they all move in together and I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean woman wouldn't be marrying him. But when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really, really mean Cilla. So Cinderella is made, she's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do. And so she's pretty much a slave again. I don't know where the dad is during all this. But so she works for a long time because in the story, it showed her as a little girl and then later on, it's like eight years later. So apparently this happened for a long time. This girl is gonna need some help. So she is still working for the family. And then um she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time and then there's that castle and she's like, oh, where other people live who I'm sure have a great life. So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife. I don't know. This sounds very crazy if I'm saying it. But it's true. So they have this dance so that the prince could find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently again, her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants. Um, but her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come, but she thinks she's gonna come. So she gets to try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that to help her get ready. And then the stepsisters are like you aren't going in, in the book, they take her necklace and tear her dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top. But they, when they're really mean. And so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubbed a lamp in there. It's maybe she read a book. I don't, I don't remember that part. But anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So she asked her fairy godmother, I guess to go to the dance. I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. Like this is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that like one night is gonna help. But anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So the fairy godmother, like gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up and then puts her in a pumpkins away. So she gets to go to the dance and, um, it looks like she had a nose job if you'll look in the book, her nose is much, much smaller and her hair is much, much blonder when she goes to the dance. So something happens and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance and the lo and behold, the prince falls in love with her. And so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her tea sisters, I guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off with the last shoes. Anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken him off 15 minutes after getting there. So she lost her shoe. And then all the prince knows is that girl he loves wore this shoe. So, um, he sends his lack of guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe. And it's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this shit."}, {"segment_name": "wright82a_28630_267990.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok.

And he asked me, he said, do you have a cardiologist? I, I I've never needed one. Said, ok, he said, I'll get one. So he just wait just a minute. He went back and he called this cardiologist and made an appointment for him to meet the helicopter at the emergency room door when they landed and they did. And when they unloaded me off the helicopter at Good Samaritan Hospital, well, he was there and he said, ok, we'll take him from here. So they took me in and started checking me over and I heard him say, yes, he has a, a major heart attack. I may start a death, uh, performing uh angio plastic surgery on me so they could put a stamp in the block.

And next time he goes out the door, he takes the umbrella lesson learned. Thank you very much. Then tell me a story about what you see. Um And I'd like the story to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, it looks to me like this little girl's cat climbed up a tree and got stuck there or just wanted to hang out there. And I would say the next thing that happened was dad tried to get up the tree to rescue the cat. And by the looks of his face, he looks stuck as well. The dog doesn't seem any please. I'm too pleased that he's up the tree and it looks like someone had to call the fire department to get the ladder to get the cat and dad down. Um So what I have for you first is I have pictures from the Disney storybook version of Cinderella that we're gonna go through just to let you kind of refresh your memory about this version afterwards. I'll take the pictures away and you can tell me the story of Cinderella as you know it it does not have to be this Disney version.

Um then let me stop sharing, give it back over to you. Ok. So at this time I'd like you to tell me as much as you remember about the story of Cinderella using any details that you already knew. You have stepmother with her two girls and then Cinderella and her father. Um I guess something happened to him that one I don't remember but Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters. Um those sisters are jealous of her and let's see um comes uh Cinderella spends a lot of time by herself."}, {"segment_name": "UNH1043_1247277_1486602.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um, the game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other and points in this sport are called runs. Um, the way that the, um, that the playing field is set up is, um, there's a diamond, um, and there's four bases at each point of the diamond. Um, the, the, the diamond is on at one point, um, and such that the, the, the bottom point is called home plate and then going and counter clockwise around the clock, there's first base, second base, third base and then back to home plate. Um, the team that is in the field and is on defense, they're allowed to have gloves. Um, and there's a ball that, uh, that, that is in play. Um, the other team that is trying to score the runs at that point is, has a bat and they have some protective equipment including helmets and such. Um, the way that the, um, the, the game starts is one team, um, is on defense so they take the field, um, and there's certain positions for each player. Um, there's nine active players per side. So the defensive team has nine players out in the field. Um, the offensive team has one bat player, um, that starts at home plate and he's called the batter. Um, the team that is in the field first is the visiting team, um, to the, to the stadium, the home team, I take it back, the visiting team backs first. The home team is on the field first. Um, the way that the game is set up, um, there are nine what are called innings and an inning consists of, um, where each team gets to bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, um, the, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs and then they switch sides where the, the home team then comes the bat and the visiting team then is in the field. Um, and then they get three outs once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning and you do nine of those sets, um, in the defensive position, there's, you know, there's several different positions, there's nine positions. Um, one of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher. And then at home plate is the catcher and then we go around, we go have a first baseman, a second baseman, a third baseman. There's someone that stands between 3rd and 2nd base called a shortstop and then beyond the diamond is a, is a field behind the diamond where three other players, um, hang out and, and, um, their goal, the defensive goal is to either, there's two ways you can make it out, you can, um, catch the ball in the, in the fly, actually, three ways in the count. Now catch the ball on the fly. If the, if the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate and the batter hits it. Um, if the batter hits the ball and, uh, someone in the field catches it for, hits the ground, um, that is one out. Um, there's something called balls and strikes where if the batter misses with his bat. Um, and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the, and the actual physical base at home plate that's called a strike, it's outside that, um, lateral movement, it's called a ball. You get three strikes and you, or your, the batter is out or if you get four balls, then the battery, it's a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out. If the batter makes it to first base before the throw gets there, he gets to, he is safe on first base"}, {"segment_name": "capilouto42a_612000_851310.wav", "aws_transcription": "Cinderella's dad um got remarried and so she acquired not only a stepmother but two stepsisters who were kind of ugly and they were pretty mean to Cinderella.

In the meantime, the prince was trying to find Cinderella. She had disappeared so rapidly and he wanted to be able to see her again. So he sent out a search for her with his man servants and they came to uh I don't know what her stepmother's name was, but they came to their home and the ugly stepsisters of course thought that they would fit into the glass slippers and whoever did was going to of course, be part of the prince's life so they couldn't fit into it.

The story of Cinderella once upon a time in a land, far, far away, there was a young girl whose parents had died, she had an aunt, but her aunt was a very bitter person. So she and the Children, her Children, her daughters were living in the house, but Cinderella was basically treated as the house maid. She had to keep the house cleaned up no matter what. As she grew older, she grew more and more beautiful, but even as beautiful as she was, she was still just a housemate. The other girls grew up, they weren't near as beautiful as she was. In the meantime, the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married and to do that, he wanted to have a great ball. He sent out invitations to all the influential people within the land that they could attend the ball. Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation and decided to send her two daughters. Cinderella said, well, can I also go and, and her mother said, no, you can't, you're just stay here and keep this place clean. So while she was doing that, she became a little bit disconcerted and her that all at once, she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once. Her very godmother came to see her and she asked what she really wanted and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball.

Just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about and you can take time to think if you, like I was gonna say because I'm gonna try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injury stories. What wasn't important as soon as I hang up from you, I'll go to that what is important. But you know, I think one of the most recent things, um is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries um or like like stopping moments as I have when that hit last January and she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU health. Um that went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so. And oh my goodness, the chain of events, I do remember that I'm not sure who was gonna bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work, she had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to, um, I guess Jackie was still there at that point and Mark, and when I called her she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the, er, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get, uh, intravenous. Um, then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth if that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not and Mark did take her to the, er, they did release her. It wasn't long after that iu then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying and then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know that they need you. So it was a decision whether to hop a plane that night and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie, it was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day and we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was our chauffeur for the entire time. We were in the doctor's office and he admitted her into the hospital, um, for that night. And the surgery was the following night I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night, which I was glad that I did because she was with it, but not really with it, but staying there with her for a few days afterwards.

And so he allowed me to go with him because I did a lot of the background work and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working uh week. And so Don stayed here and my sister from Dallas uh flew in and that was the week that they had the San Francisco earthquake. And um so we were at Fisherman's Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free. And um we were waiting to go uh, on the trolley car back to, um, Saint Francis, the western Saint Francis. And as we're waiting in line, the earthquake hit. And, um, it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that. And so my sister just being the big sister, she always tried to calm me down and she said that was probably a two or three and how she came up with that. I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake. So we didn't know. But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off so nothing worked. And so we walked 18 blocks back to our hotel. And, um, in San Francisco, you know, it's pretty hilly. And so, um, I mean, it was, it was, uh, quite a job back there and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel. So we sat outside this big, uh, park area, um, for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And, uh, the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there and we wanted to also call our two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called mother who never watches news. She doesn't like to hear, uh, the bad news and there's hardly any good news that's told. So we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching. And no, but my sister said, mother, what are you doing? And she said, well, I'm watching the news because so and so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco.

I remember the stoplights we went through, I remember the path to the hospital, I remember everything about it and then bringing her home, nothing was the same ever again.

And all I could think was when is this gonna happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain gonna come back? And um that's not how it worked at all. Actually, I I he was also born on his due date.

They are still completely different, but they are the best things I have. Like I look at my life and that's it. It's them.

So the clock started striking midnight and Cinderella had to run before the prince saw that she wasn't really a princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella. She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away. But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home and the prince was sad, but he knew he had a glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside for whosever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fit it would become his bride.

Um The majority of them are language delays and we work with them a lot. So we work, I work with these kids every day. We have a licensed speech therapist that comes in once a week and teaches a lesson and then we follow up on whatever she wants us to do the rest of the week. So, um our language kids, we really work hard with them on questions, pronouns, you know, adjectives, um, adverbs on off under over and that's a lot of just talking to them and using the correct language and using, getting them to mimic what we want them to say. So they, it just becomes natural and wrote with them. Um, we have our severe kids with um speech delays, which are their phonetics, their sounds. Um And I just wouldn't call them severe. They're in the middle. So we work a lot with stopping them every time they're, they're saying something incorrectly and, and prompting them to do either modeling or prompting them to say the correct thing, the right sound and doing a lot of the, you know, tongue up, mouth, open back in, you know, make it, you know, back in your throat sound. Um, and then our severe cases are, we have, um, two Children with autism and one child that was born, um, addicted to crack. And, um, the, the boy that was born addicted to, well, the autistic kids are, are typical autistic kids. They're, they're very, um, low verbal kids. So we're just working with them on environmental sounds and, um, becoming aware that I'm in their space and part of their world and to associate sounds and communication as a way to get me to do something for them. Um, we're working a lot on and on recognizing that a sound means me and a sound means them.

It's a lot of just rote training and repetition and over and over and over and, and sometimes we see results and sometimes it takes forever and we don't see anything but that's how it is. Can you tell me? Let's OK, thinking back. Can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad or from any time, um, from when you were a kid or more recently, choose the same story or the different story from what you told last week. Just make sure if it's the same story you tell it as if I've never heard it. I'm gonna tell you a different story. Ok? When about 1999 I took my kids sledding up in Troy, Ohio, which is just north of here. Um, my son was five and my daughter was three. So my husband went two and we were sledding and we were having a good time on the levee, which is a, a small hill, but just about right for a five year old."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL26-2_156567_395577.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok.

So it's kind of like you never know if you say, I think it's gonna rain today if that will make her cry or not. So, um, what I have found with her, um whereas we have always, she doesn't live in my same time town. So we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything. And without physically seeing her face, I have to like start the conversation slow and see where she's at and her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues or if this conversation will just be about nothing, you know. So I've had to do a lot more um listening to her and listening to the cues versus um, normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, oh my gosh, this happened today and you just start rambling, but I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her now. So she takes it all to heart. So for me, I just, I've really had to kind of let go of part of our relationship because I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's gonna upset her or not. And it's sad. But so getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody because she doesn't do facetime or anything, which to me, that would be a clear indication. I can read her face a lot better. But so asking the right questions and just listening a lot more, I'd like you to think about something important that happened in your life. And I would like you to tell me a story about this event. Um It can be happy or sad from childhood up to now anything that stands out in your mind that you would like to tell a story about. OK. Um OK, I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. Um I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy, so I really don't go to the doctors, I don't like to go to doctors and that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I just, I didn't read a lot about it. I just went through it because, I mean, I was fine the whole way and then when we got to the hospital I didn't, I had to be induced. So, I mean, I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know, know what I was signing up for. But, um, when we walked into that hospital, I mean, I got panicked because I didn't know anything. And, um, my mom was there and she came up and, um, she saw my doctor and I remember the first thing she said she goes, your doctor is as old as you are and she was, she was only like a couple of years older than me, but I really didn't think anything of them about it.

And the mirror says, still snow white that hasn't changed. And so the evil queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do because that seems like a very narrow minded and not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror. Anyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point, the queen says to herself, well, I guess I can't do anything gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well, so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so dang lonely and she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life. Um She's wishing for the one she loves even though I'm not sure she has like a true grasp of what that would actually entail. But basically one day she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet. She's kind of creepy. He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself. I'm wishing, I'm wishing for the woman I love today. And then creepy prince comes in and goes to today out of nowhere and it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet. But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life and she's terrified rightly. And so the prince goes away and she goes back to her lonely life. And this is the point at which the queen is like, well, clearly, I need to kill her if this is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this Huntsman and says, Huntsman, you're gonna kill Snow White, you're gonna bring me her heart as proof. I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like snow white. It's not like Snow White has a son on label that says property of Snow white on her heart. But that's not the point. The queen is clearly a little bit, few fries short of a happy meal. So the Huntsman goes out and he chases snow white a little bit through the woods. And then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure, he could never kill her. And so he falls to his knees in suffocation and he says, I'm so sorry, and he drops the knife. And so it's like and then he says, run away and I will cover for you, but you better run away and never come back because the queen is gonna kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the Huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest and he brings the heart of a wild boar to the queen and says, look queen, this is Snow White's heart part of a wild pork doesn't look like a human heart. The queen is stupid, basically. And the queen says, oh yes, cook that into a meal for me. And then she proceeds to eat this bore heart thinking that it's Snow whites, which is weird. This is not a movie. I would show my kids, I don't know about you. Um, so Snow White is flood into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her and she's making weird faces again. And eventually she makes it to this cottage where she breaks in breaking and entering also a common theme in these stories. Um, she breaks in and she sees it's kind of dusty and kind of gross, but she sees all in her little row, a bunch of little vents like for people who are maybe 3 ft tall if that.

And, um, and she had a horse and a carriage to ride to, to the ball in and she went to the royal ball and um, and danced with the prince and he fell in love with her and, um, they were having their night of romance and, uh, and um, suddenly she remembered that, um, her fairy godmother told her when the clock strikes 12, the spell would be broken that she put on her with all and her, she would lose her fancy dress and then her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin, um, and her clothes would go back to her normal raggedy clothes. And so she ran off and left the princess. But when she ran off, one of her, she had on silver slippers, glass slippers and one of them, she stepped out of one and left him on the the stairway going down from the castle. And so, um she went back home and the still broke and everything turned back to normal and she went on about her business. But uh she still had one glass slipper and then one left behind. So, um again, the the palace sent out a notice to everybody in the community that the prince was going to try to find his love and he was going to go around to all the houses that had young women in them and have them try on the glass slipper to see if um who to find his, his love and see who it was. That left that slipper behind. Well, um, the ugly, the, the stepmother let lock Cinderella in her room.

And I remember feeling really weak and lethargic and I would be just on the floor. We had a, a room that was like a, a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it and I just slept on the floor and I wasn't experiencing any, any pain or terrible itching yet. Uh But that did come and I remember feeling my mom would create this like mixture of some kind of paste that she would put on my, the, you know, on the, the chickenpox. And I think that it was like, I wanna say like baking soda and water or it was some combination of something like that. And it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store and she probably was not gonna do that because in order to save money. Um but it worked, I, I do remember that and, and I remember she would put me in the bath with uh that oatmeal kind of mixture and it was very soothing. And then after the bath would put this again, this paste or this mixture on the different spots. Um But even though those things helped me physically feel better, the thing that I, I remember about when I started to feel better, like, really feel better is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff stickers. And we had sticker books and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers. And I focused on my sticker book instead of the chickenpox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the, you know, the kind of itching and scratching and uh it put me in a better mood. So I wasn't as lethargic. Um And you know, I got better.

And this helmet teacher hasn't been retired long and I was used, she said here I am Becky even had her when she was in middle school. She had to use me as an example through all of her years of teaching. So, how's that? Um But I am curious, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating. But is there someone that comes to mind? Ok. Great. Um So in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did to what you did about it, if anything, I was special needs teacher for 10 years and still go. Um, so does Becca for that matter, still go to IKEA once a year with them. And there are usually 7 to 8 that go and we chaperone and they have classes, but three of them are brothers of which only one can speak the others you have to um, follow their, uh, hand communication. It's not that they sign language but they try to because it's more in the grunting, um, aspect of interesting enough. Usually her, his mom knows what he's referring to. Um, so I would say it's, it's more being patient and they eventually get their story out by pointing by, um, doing the same thing over or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you. And I think that is probably my nephew is autistic and nonverbal and pretty much it's the same thing. He just takes you by the hand and takes you to where he wants to go."}, {"segment_name": "wright38a_427061_665901.wav", "aws_transcription": "Little boy's getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella.

There's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can. The ball sails quite a ways. In fact, it sails so far, it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room. When it comes through the glass. After breaking the window, it even knocks over a lamp. In the living room, the man who is sitting in his living room, minding his own business before the ball comes flying through, jumps up, grabs the ball and looks out the window. But the boys run away. There once was a young girl called Cinderella. She had three ugly stepsisters and her family didn't like her very much and made her do all the household chores. She had to scrub and she had to clean and she had to cook and sew and everything all by herself. While her step sisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun. Um One day the prince was going to have a big ball and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear, looking around, buying new dresses, checking out how they looked, but Cinderella couldn't go when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says, what's wrong with Cinderella? Why are you so depressed? Cinderella says I can't go to the ball that the prince is having. But my step sisters get to go instead. And a fairy godmother says, well, nonsense and she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears and she says, well, you're gonna need a horse or horses and a coach to ride. So she snatches up some mice that we're playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage and she gives her, gives her, a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball. But the stepmother said the fairy godmother says, be sure you're home by midnight. The magic is only good for one day at the stroke of midnight. All of this will disappear. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince. He just wants to dance with her all night when she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight. Oh, goodness. So she turns and races out of the ball and in a hurry to get away, she drops one of her glass slippers falls off of her foot, hops into her carriage and as they race away, but right at the stroke of midnight, the horses change back into mice. The carriage changes back into a pumpkin and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen. She sneaks into the house and all her stepsisters were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady."}, {"segment_name": "MSUC03b_502467_741303.wav", "aws_transcription": "Mhm. Something important. Uh, I guess a lot of important things sort of happened, you know. Um, it would be hard to, uh, I think, I think, um, in a sense I made my own important things. Um, for instance, um, uh, I grew up in a family, I was one of five Children and now I don't want this to sound, you know, politically incorrect. But my father was, uh, Italian of Italian descent and he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college and unfortunately four of us were girls. So he didn't, that wasn't, he wasn't pleased with that either. And I was the third one, can you imagine in a row? No boys yet? So, anyhow, it was made very clear that, um, college was not on the map. Uh, and his, his, his idea was that, um, I've been supporting you all these years and now you owe me, you have to go to work and contribute to the household. So, this was a built in thing at the time. I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it that I'll be going to work soon. And the good news was that I was, uh, also an honor student and I got to high school at 12 and the bad news was at 16. My education was complete. So, and now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was, she was suicidal. I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student. She actually wanted to call him and I was very calm about the whole thing. I said there's really no point, you know, it's, you're not gonna get anywhere. This is the state of things. It's the state of the art at the household. And that's that. So anyway, um, she then decided to take me under her wing and, um, knew someone down on Wall Street and uh who worked in a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust company which no longer exists. And they took great pride in that, that company that they, they were at one Wall Street and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street and this was verbalized. So anyway, um, she called her friend and, uh I'll never forget her name was Mary, who I went to say. So I, I put a suit on, uh went shopping and bought myself, you know, very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview. And I think I was a shoe in because her friend, the guidance counselor had called her and so she hired me and I ended up in a sub basement, not just a basement, it was a sub basement. I think I was lower than the vaults in a secretarial pool. Where else I could be a genius when I was going to a secretarial pool. I did and good, good on me. I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to, even though I had an academic um uh course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study and I, and I, I took typing and stenography. I thought this might help me and maybe my job won't be so random.

They were the favorite ones, but Cinderella never complained. She made friends with all the animals around the house and was just a happy go lucky girl. And one day there was going to be a big ball at the castle and um all the young maidens in the land were invited to attend the celebration. But Cinderella's stepmother said she couldn't go because she did not have a proper dress, but her stepsisters were going to go and they had the best dresses around. And um Cinderella found her trunk with a dress but her mother said it it wasn't suitable to go. So Cinderella was crying with her animal friends and out of nowhere appeared her fairy godmother who turned her dress into a beautiful ball gown and turned her animal friends into um, the carriage and the horse and the driver. So she was able to attend the ball. So she attended the ball. But her fairy godmother had one wish for her or one statement for her that all the um dress and the um carriage would expire at midnight. So she had to leave the dance before midnight. So she went to the dance and she danced with the prince and they had a wonderful time and she saw the cock was getting close to being midnight. So she left in a hurry because she didn't want her gown to change back to just a plain old dress. And at that time, she accidentally lost her glass slipper, but she returned to her house and um told her animal friends all about the dance and meeting the prince. Well, and unbeknownst to her, the prince had kept the glass slipper and he wanted to find out who the maiden was that wore that glass slipper.

So Cinderella came and said, may I try it on and she did and it fit and um her and her prince lived happily ever after the end.

So she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and her stepsisters to wait because she could go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished her chore. And then stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her beauty, beautiful dress. And they see that the decorations are stuff that she stole from their garbage.

Uh, another, uh, uh, she goes and cleans it out again, which she said, I don't like doing this twice so soon. But I feel like I should. Well, the 11th day I was at work and they called me and they told me that, uh, uh, he told me that he was shaking the bed, he was jerking. So, well, he said, get him to the hospital. I called the doctor and he said, get me to the hospital and the bacteria, we run into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office and, and, and she smelled at the area. She said it's back. So there he had, they had killed all of those blood cells in there. No hope so. He had to wear tube. He be in there for years and, and, and be there the rest of his life and, and so this goes on for eight years. I had a, um, change those, uh, change the, the bandage and, and, uh, and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet. And it was very painful. At first I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time to get the, the, the, the catheter and it all changed because it, it was a procedure that had to be done in the hospital. Well, my daughter was a nurse and she kept wanting me to go to the, to the va because he was a veteran and, and, and, uh, get the things over there and they had a bacteria, a committee over there that might be able to help him. So we go over there and while we were in this office, there was this, uh, uh, cabinet there. They had tape, silk tape in it and it was wide. And so I asked the nurse, I said, where do you get that wide tape? I said I can only find the narrow and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged that we were paying over 200 or close to $300 at that time, uh, um, a month for his supplies and she said you can have anything you want. Well, the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was procedure that he would, he knew I could do it, but he wouldn't give it to me because it was a procedure done in hospital. So, when she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her what size catheter I wanted. Sterilized pins and, and the, and the solution to, to irrigate with and everything that he needed the, and, and the sterilized gloves and all.

Well, I, after I got through, I sat there couldn't get up because I thought if I, that pen that went down into his cavity, they'd have to do surgery to get, going in there to get it, get that tube, that tube out. And, and, and so, uh, I was scared to death, but he said I did much better job than they did in the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm gonna do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through, through the, to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity. And that way, uh, I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He weighed 200 some pounds and, and, and then he went down to 100 and 26 when he went left the hospital and he came back upward. Nobody knew that he was sick.

You know, I've never heard this before anyway.

I said, let me think about it. He said, you think about it, but I'm gonna go around to the rest of the floor, come back to you have to have your answer by the time I come back. So I said, all right, as soon as he left, I was like, I can't chance it. And I was afraid to fall asleep. Bruce was coming. He was dropping the kids off in high school at that point. One of them was, um, so he was there by 7 45 in the morning. He told him the same story I just told you and I said, I don't want to risk having the second walk. So he didn't.

His name is Jorge. He's Mexican and he and I worked together uh at a company called Net. So, and what we did was it was a remote diagnostics of routers, trouble, network trouble. And Jorge was great that he could talk to the Spanish speaking customers wonderfully. But when it would come over to an English speaking customer, he definitely had a problem. He, he didn't have terrible problems, but it was hard trying to get him to recognize that he wasn't saying things right. And it was hard getting him to understand what I was saying sometimes. So we got to the point where I joked with him about some of the ways he would say things like he would have a piece of paper instead of a piece of paper. Um And then, um it was, it was just Jorge, you sound like this and he was totally shocked because he didn't know he sounded like that. And he says JB, you are the first person that's ever told me that I'm saying that stuff wrong. So that felt good that I was able to help him and I was able to learn about his communications because he helped me. Yeah, I had high school Spanish. That's been a few years ago, but he helped me understand some phrases and in fact, he actually helped my daughter with her. Uh, she went on a, a, what do you call it? It's not an immersion in Mexico.

Um, but what I remember about it most is a, it hurt, but my surgery was scheduled at like 11 30 in the morning, but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there, I was like a little bit dehydrated. So they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me like six times in order to get the IV in. And that was very, very unpleasant.

I was like, oh, that's gonna be great. You're gonna give me drugs and I'm listening to Pink Floyd. So this is gonna be a good day. Uh, so did that, um, laid down on the gurney, they gave me, uh, the IB and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery, uh, and my throat hurt. It was painful. I felt, I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurt so bad. Um, they were trying to give me like some water to help kind of soothe out my throat and I couldn't swallow it. So it was coming back out of my nose. It was just, it was a mess. It was horrible. Um, but the whole thing probably took like, 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out. But it was like 12 hours of torture for that. Um, and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to, to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. Um, you know, people are like, oh, you always get ice cream, you get ice cream. But I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream. So that made it that much worse. Um, I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt. It was burning my throat. Um, and it was probably, it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that.

So I found that if you were returning a ticket for the next 24 hours, you got 60% knocked off the price, you only got 40% of your money back.

Yeah. Ok. Once upon a time, long, long ago in the land of make believe there was a man who lost his wife, a young daughter, a sweet young woman, a sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella. He decided it was time that he got took away for himself, mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman as she was growing up, she needed a mother. And so he married a widow, a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters. The woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her and she banished her to the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs and her to her own. Two little girls who are really nasty little brats got to sit around, get lots of new clothes and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked. But she had her little cat who she loved and the cat kept her company and helped as much as she could. And this went on.

Well, cats up in the tree, they get stuck in trees. I guess. I've, I've heard stories like that. I guess it's the, um, the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help. The little girl looks like she's ready to catch the cat. The little dog, of course, wants the cat down for different reasons and then the fire department shows up which they're good like that.

Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can and you can use any details, you know about this story as well as pic the pictures that you just looked at. Ok. So Cinderella is sent to live with this uh with the family and she is basically a uh a maid and um they, they are the two steps, the two, I think it's the wicked stepsisters if I recall. And they were, they were rather homely and the Cinderella of course, is very pretty and she's very, you know, sweet and helpful. And these two are kind of spoiled and, you know, not very pleasant and there's going to be a ball and I believe invitations go out and the two sisters are going to um uh they're gonna go to the ball and Cinderella is not invited and somehow the fairy godmother steps in and Cinderella ends up with uh well, it's all magical, you know. Right. The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach and by dint of, you know, luck and good favor from the, the fairy godmother. Cinderella does go to the ball.

They're the young boy and his mom and his mom's trying to give him an umbrella and he refuses it. He doesn't want to take it.

Take your time looking at it and give me a story that has a beginning, a medal and a, um, there was a little girl riding her tricycle and her cat somehow got up in the tree and, um, the dog is barking because he wants the cat. And that's probably why the cat ran up the tree. And then a, a man climbed up from the tree to try to get the cat and he can't get down and the firefighters are coming to come rescue the man because his ladder fell down and to rescue the cat.

Ok, because I'm, I hope the other person in the room is an audiologist, but it is what it is. Um So he, he went for the ENT said him to the audiologist and the audiologist was in this little glass room with, you know, stuffed animals that moved and symbols and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this and she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass because before she moved the drums, she, he was so smart, she looked at the drums and then she looked at him and then she moved the drums and then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey with the symbol and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway, the ENT and I get into it in a big loud way because I, he, he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests. Anyway, we go through it. So finally, finally he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with a speech language pathologist. He was 2.8 I think at that time that fall, I'll never forget the first session, Madison. I was like, this is never gonna work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early thirties. She looked like Cinderella, blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him to the verge of tears. Every sessions we were private pay. She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate the session and she worked wonders and we ate, drank and slept letters and sounds that sheep in the jeep book, alphabet cereal, alphabet pasta. It was like crazy town. So we did that um with private pay with her and then at three years old, the town would pick him up. So I thought it's a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that S LP um just in case with funding. And um Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use. I can't, it would be not right for me to take your money anymore. He was initially when she met him consultation. He was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she, you know, when she dismissed him, you're good. He's all good to go. I was real paranoid and she's, the only thing is 50% of the Children with this, um, diagnosis. The, the way they're taught, traditionally taught how to read in public schools, they're not able to learn how to read that way. So, you may, at that point, you know, have to, I don't know what, go to private school, get another read. I didn't know what we were going to do medicine. But I was like, wow. So anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young S LP who had just graduated Madison. She was lovely, so sweet. He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on every time we went in there. She was so sweet. She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave. He would look at me and smile. Oh my gosh, it was terrible. And then she went off to, I don't know where. And then he got a, an experienced older woman who again cracked the whip with him.

That was a big mistake because I ate, I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time and, and then my, uh, uh, blood pressure went really high and, uh, like towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up with, um, toxemia. And so I, they realized it when I had woken up one morning with like a, it was probably beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything. My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill him and, and I just, my, it was like a pulsating thing in my head. And I went in and I had to the, to the clinic which was close to my house and then I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like, by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often and it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken. Then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and, and talk really fast and write everything down that he says. And then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day I came in, I went to pee in the cup and then went to go uh to take my blood pressure and I'd have to sit at this machine and it takes your blood pressure and prints it out and then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did, I went, put it in there printed out. I handed it to the nurse and she was just like, mm, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, ok, so I do it again and it prints it out and it's just as high. So they're like, so irritated with me by this point. Like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse who's the professional, right? Does it and realizes holy crap. This woman's got like really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away and they said we're checking you in right now. And so, because this is very serious and they checked and they had like, I don't know, what is it, like sugar or something in my urine? And my, yeah, so there's all kinds of problems happening with me unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and, uh, put me on a really strict diet and, uh, after a couple of days my blood pressure went down. But then, um, they said, well, it's, you're, we could send you home, but, but we're not 100% sure that you could control this. So we think we should induce you because it was, I was far enough alone. And so it was a Tuesday morning and they said at 5 30 in the morning, we're gonna bring you down to induce you. And they, oh, this is kind of gross. But they made me take a suppository.

She just has the, the animals who are her friends because otherwise she's cleaning the house and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters and they uh take care of, they, they, they kind of are quite selfish and do whatever they want.

I believe I've kind of lost it there, but she gets home and on the way home, she lost one of her beautiful slippers and she doesn't realize it's at the time, but that's actually a good thing to lose a slipper because in the following days, the prince who was very upset because this woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball, he would like to see her again. He'd like her to become princess, but she vanished. And the only thing left is the slipper that she lost. And unfortunately, it didn't hit anything hard on the ground or it would have just been a pile of glass shards, but he has a slipper and he makes the rounds of, uh, every household in the country. Of course, not including the lower class ones or the households that were, that were, uh, owned by immigrants or foreigners who were, had, been living there but couldn't become citizens. Or, and if the other Riff Raff would just, uh, the households with eligible women who could by means of class being his princess. And when they get to, uh, where our heroine lives, the, uh, the bad women try on the slipper. And of course it doesn't fit, but it fits on our heroine who is then understood to be the woman that the prince danced with at the ball and, and all is well with the world."}, {"segment_name": "wright93a_99243_337745.wav", "aws_transcription": "I can remember a time when I worked a double shift and which means I work two at my regular shift and then I worked the night shift and then I was invited to go to a party where uh some, a friend of mine purchased a home and, um, so she wanted me to see her house and her friends were all gonna be there. So I went over and, um, had a good time. I was tired, had one glass of wine, I can remember had one glass of wine. I had some tamales. I had beans and rice and a salad. And after that, I just started really, really getting sleepy and tired. So I said I had to get going home. So I went home and rolled the window down and started Daz dozing off a little bit. And then, uh I continued going home at that time. I lived in Upland and Upland has a, uh a long, it's Euclid Avenue. It's a long street that goes north up to Mount Bley. Well, I just lived in the, in the foothills of Mount Baldy. So, uh all these trees and everything that uh I was passing by. It was, it was in the evening real late in the evening, maybe like one o'clock in the morning. And all I can remember was waking up and the police officer was asking me questions and it was, I remember it was blurry and, and then I, I don't remember anything else after that. And then I woke up again and I was in the hospital and I woke up and there was patches all over my face. I could barely see out only one eye because it was my other face was covered. What happened is I ran into a telephone post and I, um, I had cuts, I still have a scar here. I pushed, I had my fingers, my thumbs, I was holding the steering wheel like this. And when I hit the telephone post, I bent the, um, steering column upward. And I, I remember breaking through the glass with my hands and, uh, luckily I didn't break my thumbs. I had, I guess it got hit mostly on this arm. It pushed in this area. So the doctor stated that I didn't break my thumb because I was, it hit. I was able to use this part of arm. But what I did do with a force and I was wearing a seat belt, but I ended up twisting my upper torso. So I was so much in pain and they fixed my, oh, by the way, I cut my face somehow, I tore my, my face right in here. I had to have plastic surgery and, um, how, uh, I had to go to a Carra because I couldn't even pick up my shoe. So I went to a chiropractor and, uh, he took an x-ray and my spine was like an s with, with the, with the force of hitting, uh, that, uh, telephone post. So it took me about six months. I had acupuncture and the chiropractor was straightening my spine, pulling and tugging. He told me it was gonna hurt and he gave me exercises to do with weights so I could walk straight and keep my posture straight. I was very lucky.

And his mom yelled at him. And so history repeats itself. He kicks the ball through somebody else's front window lands in the dude's lap where he's sitting innocently on his sofa trying to read the newspaper. He doesn't have a newspaper but it knocks over a lamp which is, you know, further damage that this little punk is gonna have to pay for. And the man picks up the ball goes to the window and looks out the kid has already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences. Thank you. You're welcome. Ok. So here is another set of sequences and again, I just, um you can take a look at the pictures, take your time and then tell me a story with the beginning and then it'll end an end. A small child has a history of violent behavior. And so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checked weather dot com this morning and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain. So he's probably ok. So the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds onto the umbrella and lo and behold, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain and he's dismayed because not only was he? Right, he also now doesn't have an umbrella. So he runs back home and he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he's not allowed to say I told you so, and his mother relents and gives him an umbrella with which to walk to school, but he's already wet. So it's kind of, you know, immaterial at this point for a small child, you should not hit people with things, this wouldn't happen. All right. And um, this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. Um, so I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and um, tell me a story again for the beginning, a middle and an end, right? It was a nice morning and this bird was in the tree singing. At which point the cat thought to itself, I'm a cat, I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential. And so the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that bird just kind of narrow and the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he can't get done. So he may as well look like he did it on purpose. At which point, the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself that cat needs rescuing because I'm nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat, but the cat is too scared to come down and they're certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms because it's a cat in their ordinary. And so the girl goes and gets her dad and the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there and he's not really about that. So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat, it's just a stray dog. It lives by the school. But, you know, goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet it. It's a nice dog, but it sees the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident. And so the man is stuck in the tree, even though he could jump, that's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he stuck in the tree with the dog barking, barking up the right tree. And So he pulls his cellphone out of his pocket. It's probably a flip phone. Maybe a nokia, like something really sturdy. He looks like an old fashioned kind of guy."}, {"segment_name": "richardson175_17933_256420.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok.

And then he's looking out the window with the ball to see who the perpetrator is, I assume. All right, great. We're gonna do the same thing with these. So, just take a look at them and then whenever you're ready, a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end, ok. Um, the little boy's, uh, little little woman's son, um, is refusing an umbrella. His mother is saying he made me for the day. He's like, I'll be fine without it. And then of course, it starts to rain on him and he's not appreciating the rain too much and he comes home and his mother sees that he is sucking wet, he comes back for the umbrella as soon and then he gets the umbrella and goes his merry way. All right, great. Same thing with this one. It is a little bit different. It's I have an entire scene. So you wanna look at the whole picture and then a story with a beginning, a middle and an end whenever you are ready. Ok. It looks like, uh, the little girl's cat got up the tree and her father or older brother or somebody climb up the tree to try to rescue the cat. And then he unfortunately also became stuck. And so they had to call the fire department out there to rescue both the cat and the father from the tree. All right, great. And all right. Have you ever heard of Cinderella? Yes. Ok. So I'm gonna have you look through this book, there are no words in here, just the pictures. But once you take as much time as you need to look through all the pictures and then whenever you're ready, I'm gonna take the book back and have you tell me this story as best you can. Yes. All right. I have you tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details, you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Ok. Uh Cinderella seems to be brought to uh perhaps she has no parents or something she's brought to her aunt's house or something like that to live and she's made to be used as a maid which she waits on her uh two cousins and her aunt and takes care of the animals and all that and it appears that the, her two cousins are invited to a party, a ball of some sort, I guess. And they're really excited about going to the ball and, um, she has no clothes but little mice and stuff and birds make a dress for her.

Uh Cinderella in the meantime, was looked out of her window and saw the, the castle where the, where the big ball was taking place and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball. Uh She was helped by her little friends, the mice and, and the owl. And they all said, oh, Cinderella, why don't you try and contact your fairy godmother? She might be able to help you. Well, Cinderella said, I don't know how to do that. And he said, well, look, look in the trunk, there's a book in the trunk. If you read how to find your fairy godmother, she might turn up and be able to help you and she did that and one that the fairy godmother approached and said, Cinderella, you shall go to the ball.

And she said, you go and you have a good time, my child. But remember one thing when the clock strikes midnight, you must already have returned from the ball. So Cinderella promised to do that. She went to the ball. The prince fell madly in love with her and she with him and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to um have left by the time that the clock struck 12. So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could. And in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step. That was the only thing that the prince had to identify her with. Uh shortly after that, the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman. He who had no idea who she was. The only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper. So he sent a court here around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper and said anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her. And of course, the court here arrived at Cinderella's house and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and of course, couldn't do that until Cinderella said I would like to try and she did.

And they were looking to expand the, their work in John's particular area of expertise um in as far as marketing goes in Europe. And so they asked him and another guy who had a similar job to his in the company to interview um to, to have a job over there. So turned out that they preferred John of the two. And uh so they asked him to move over to Switzerland. We were kind of obviously, but we knew that we were gonna have to leave our beautiful place in Vermont. I mean, Vermont, we lived there for 20 years and we loved it very much, but we knew we were gonna have to leave eventually because this job was just gonna take him somewhere else. So we thought, well, why not go to Europe? And so we decided to, he went over a year before I did, um, and live, found us a place and did all the, you know, stuff that you have to do to get used to living in another country all by myself, which, you know, bravo him. Um, and then I went over and joined him after our daughter got married in June of 99. Um, and, uh, so we, we lived in, we lived in a little village outside of Zurich and it was an adorable little village. We live. The funny thing was we lived in a very, very modern little apartment complex, maybe. Oh, I don't know, 20 or 25 apartments in it, two levels, maybe not even that many. But anyway, just, and everything else in the village was lovely and charming and old. And, um, we did a lot of, uh, not, you know, now that I think about it when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of traveling in Switzerland and, uh, and walking around our village because Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl. So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms and then they have path walking paths everywhere because the Swiss love to walk. And so we could walk like to the next village or through and basically going by the, uh, fields or we could walk through the woods. Uh, and they had passed, going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company, meanwhile, bought a French scale company, John worked for weighing uh in his case, it was weighing of heavy duty like trucks and railroad cars. And um uh they bought a scale company in France. And so we were asked to move to France, which was like throwing me into the briar patch because I um was a French teacher. And so this was like the dream of a lifetime actually. And so, um in, in Zurich, they speak German, which was OK. That was kind of fun too. But I had taken a little German. My family is German.

Um, Cinderella was a little more pretty on the inside and the outside than the stepsisters and she had a very good heart and she just did the thing she was supposed to do and try to keep herself happy. I'm sure found out that there was an announcement being made. Um by this, grew up by the king that the prince was going to be hosting a ball with hopes to find his future bride. And um when the mother read it, the girls were all excited and started getting their dresses together and Cinderella helped get their dresses together, helped them get together and quietly, she made her own dress and she got dressed for the ball to go to the ball that day. And the stepmother said Oh, no, you're not going, you have to stay home and clean the house and get things together and no one will want to anyway. So then the stepsisters left for the ball and then no one went to her room was crying and her fairy godmother showed up and helped her create a new dress and a pumpkin turned into a coach to take her to the ball. And the mouse, mice and the different animals were either horses or the sports, the coach driver and the fairy godmother made Cinderella a pair of glass slipper shoes to work to the ball. And so Cinderella secretly went to the ball without anybody knowing. And she showed up at the ball and came down the steps and the prince saw her and was entranced by enchanted by her and they danced um the one rule for the step, the one rule that the fairy godmother told her was everything will turn back into what it was originally at the stroke of midnight. So to make sure that she was home by the stroke of midnight, so she was at the dance, she was at the ball dancing and she heard the chimes and ran out, leaving the prince standing there and the prince chased after her, but she couldn't, he couldn't catch her. And as she was running, she lost one of the glass slippers and then she got back to the coach and, and was on her way home was almost there and everything turned back into um what it was originally. So then the prince found the slipper on the step and he insisted that his royal staff help him find the woman that it belonged to because he knew that was the woman for him. Oh, they did a search. They went to all the houses and tried it on all the girls and they tried it on two stepsisters, it didn't fit them. And then they said, well, that was the last house. And then the one person, then the prince saw Cinderella standing behind in the background that we hadn't tried it on her. My stepmother said, oh, it won't fit her. She wasn't at the ball.

So he turns around and goes back home to his mother. So then his mother gives him the uh umbrella and goes back to school. Ok. This story is about uh Cinderella.

So one day uh they received a letter, it was an invitation to a um big uh celebration where we're gonna have dancing and uh at um, I guess at a, uh, Prince house. So, uh, she was reading it out loud when Cinderella was in the room and was excited for them because they were going to this big ball. And, um, her being young, she wished that she could go to something like that, but she knew that she could never attend to say anything like that. And she had, uh, the, the girls were all excited, they were getting ready, they were preparing for the big day. And um, so they ended up uh having their dresses made and um, the day it was getting closer and closer. So she was Cinderella was upset because it was getting closer for that time.

And I think they get married and I think he quickly sadly dies. So Cinderella is now left in the home with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who really were never so great to her. Anyway, but now that her dad is gone, she is treated very terribly and she's no longer really a family member. She's treated like um the maid, the slave and they call her Cinderella because they make her, you know, to clean out the chimney and she has dirt that look like Cinders on her face. So anyway, um in this land where they live, there's a kingdom with a king and a prince and they make the castle makes a declaration, they're gonna have a ball and all the young women in the land are invited to come meet the eligible prince and the stepsisters are very excited and Cinderella is excited because she's not married as well. And then she quickly finds out from her stepsisters and her stepmother that there is absolutely no way that she is going. Um, she's just not worthy of going. Plus I think the stepsisters really could always tell she was much more beautiful than they were and they didn't want the competition at the ball. So the night of the ball comes and um they lock her in somewhere. I, I think the old stories they locked her in somewhere and off. They went and she, she is crying or sitting there so sad and what a horrible life and her father and she had such a great life and she's been terrible since he died. And her fairy godmother appears and she shares all that has happened and not happening with the fairy godmother. And the fairy god mother says, Cinderella, you're going to go to the ball and she uh gets the help of the mice and she does all sorts of boom magic on little Cinderella and she, her hair is done, her makeup, her jewelry, a beautiful gown and um she takes a pumpkin from the outside and she makes that a beautiful, beautiful chariot and the little mice are but, you know, bit boomed and they're turned into horsemen and she's just about to leave and she says, you have a wonderful time. You look beautiful. However, all this magic and the spells will expire at midnight. You must get home by midnight. Cinderella says, certainly off. They all go this beautiful chariot to the ball. She goes, she is by far the most beautiful woman in the room and the prince finally asks her to dance and then they continue dancing throughout the evening and they're enjoying each other's conversation and all of a sudden she sees and then starts hearing the clock which is about to strike midnight and she says, I have to go. He says, no, no, no. She says yes, yes, yes. And as she's rushing out of the ball and down the palace steps, she loses a slipper, she gets in just barely gets into that chariot and out of the sight of the palace puffed back into a pumpkin. She walks the rest of the way home with the mice and she gets home in time before the stepsisters who then a arrive home and they share with their mom and Cinderella. Um what a wonderful time they had, but they do kind of sort of make reference that the prince did spend most of his time dancing with one beautiful woman.

You couldn't even take the radiation amount on, it was on the ship that they were on. Well, they went out and gathered all of those men up and, and, and took them back onto the ship and the captain was taken off and taken somewhere else. They never saw him again.

It's like a stone wall and, and so they put over $10,000 worth of medication into his lung cavity to kill that. Well, when we went home on Christmas Eve, he was bacteria free, but they taught me how to irrigate it and there was a container sitting there and I said, I've never done this before. I never watched them do it. So she said, I'm gonna show you how, she said I've never done it before either. I said, if you haven't done it before, do you know what to do?

They were just very shrill and very unattractive young women. Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and, and just, just very nice. These two were, were very spoiled and, and didn't have any appreciation for anything. I mean, Cinderella was so nice, even the barn yard, you know, animals loved her, the horse, the whoever was out there, mice even, you know, she was a delight. Anyway, um there's a, a, an an announcement comes to the uh unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their, their M mansion, I guess where they lived, they weren't in the castle. Uh They got an invitation to, to a ball, the prince was gonna give a ball and Cinderella used to, she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance. And so when news came of this ball, uh she was also silently very excited about it. But the two girls, you know, of course they were going, they had an invitation uh and somehow I have to get some of the details in between, but there was a fairy godmother who ends up, you know, helping working some magic. And Cinderella does go to the ball uh like a pumpkin that the, the what was that gets turned into a carriage and with horses and she's got a beautiful gown on and she just looks really just beautiful and she uh the prince, of course, you know, um sees her right away and uh you know, one of those across a crowded room and they danced all night and it was very romantic and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters who they were. Was that the stepsisters or was that another story? The wicked step sister? I don't know anyhow, um those horrible faces like so anyway, the the one caveat was that Cinderella had to be home by midnight and you see the the clock is striking 12 and she's saying goodbye to the prince. Of course, he doesn't want her to let her leave and she's late. She's running down this, you know, a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe, one of her glass slippers and uh the uh butler or whoever major domo from the the palace was sent around, you know, to the town to find who fits into the shoe. And uh Cinderella gets locked up. You know, the mother, that horrible mother thought that, you know, they cram the shoe on one of her daughter's feet and I remember their feet were ugly too and, uh, the mice ends up getting, oh, she was locked in this room, you know, they didn't want her on the scene. And, um, the mice brought her the key. She got out and tried on the shoe. Of course, it fit perfectly. She married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after one hopes and I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at that wedding. Those, those horrible people. All right. So let's move on to something a little bit different. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Ok. Now, I really wish they had two pieces of bread here. Otherwise it's an open face. They don't call it a sandwich. Right. So, be nice. We'll, we'll pretend we have two pieces of bread and, uh, I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread.

So, I mean, it was all kinds of stories about him. But, well, there was this little girl named Cinderella who is like really cute little girl and, but unfortunately her mother, something nasty happened to her. I think she went to the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years. And so Cinderella had to go move in with her evil stepmother. And um and her evil stepmother had two other daughters and evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didn't like Cinderella. So Cinderella and um you know, they're just, this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house. She's got to clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff. So anyways, you know, the mom and the step girls, they're kind of reading the mail and they get an invitation to the ball where the prince is going to be there. Like, the prince is like this totally hot dude where Cinelli just has totally got the hots for this guy. It's like he is like on television all the time and she knows what he looks like and is like, really wants to dance with him and stuff. But the evil stepmother says, no, you're not getting a dress. You know, it's like, you know, you're a cleaning girl and you stay home and you know, clean the attic and stuff. Well, me and your steps sisters were going to go to the ball. So she go shopping and they get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelry and new shoes and everything and they go out and get ready to go to the ball. Meanwhile, poor cire, she's up in the attic and she's crying while they're all going away. And um, she's kind of just wishing, wish I could go to the mall or to the mall and all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and uh, brun Hilder, the fairy godmother says, what's, what's the deal? What are you so upset about? And Cinderella says, I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy and I like to dance and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff. But that evil stepmother of mine won't let me go. So anyways, there's the, the, the fairy godmother, you know, gets out the wand and touches Cinderella and all of a sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown, ball gown and gives her glass slippers and a really cool looking. And then they go out in the garden and they dig up a pumpkin and she kind of does the pumpkin and turns the pumpkin into a carriage and then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horse that pulls the bar carriage and because you have to pull up the castle in a carriage or they won't let you into the ball. So anyways, they get into the, she gets into the pumpkin and the fairy godmother even put some like uh air freshener in there. So it didn't smell like a pumpkin and they went to the ball and they got to the castle and they were able to sneak in and, you know, she's kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies and you know, the fairy God or the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters, they're kind of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her. And even when they see her, they don't even think it's her because she's so pretty. Anyways, the prince comes in and you know, they have the dance and they're all dancing around and he uh sees Cinderella kind of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says, I don't know who you are, who are you? And she said, I'm Cinderella. And he says, well, would you like to dance? And she says, well, I don't not sure, I'm not sure I know how to dance, but I'd love to try.

So that was to be a dances at the castle where the prince was. And the two sisters older than Cinderella and their mother received an invitation to the dance and were quite put up with themselves with, with them. So anyway, the uh they're looking over their wardrobes trying to find out what they should wear. And Cinderella doesn't have much in the way of clothing. It's pretty sad.

But, um, he healed fine and, uh, there were no bad side effects from it. There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water and the current is very rapid.

And she used her magic wand and said, Cinder gave Cinderella a beautiful white dress and Cinderella was getting into the carriage and the fairy godmother said you have to be home by midnight. Once the clock strikes 12, everything will return to what it was. So Cinderella went to the ball and was asked to dance with the prince and they were dancing and it was really close to midnight and the evil stepsisters were watching and they were so angry. But at midnight when the clock struck 12, even though Cinderella was having a wonderful time, she had to take off and she started running down the stairs and the prince's people that help him followed her and she left one of her glass slippers.

Do you want to see the photos again before you retell the story? Um No. OK. Some people like to look through twice. OK. And when you're ready retell me the story of Cinderella. Cinderella was a little farm girl whose dad actually did have somewhat of a title but only because he inherited it from her mother. When her mother passed away. He remarried. Oh, he was a merchant too. He remarried and she brought the two stepdaughters. One is Brunilda and I can't remember the name of the other one. So Giselle, who is Cinderella. In this story, she tries her best to make friends and to do everything that her stepmother and her two sisters demand of her when she always dreams for a better time and a better life, she's very kind, does her work and is subordinate and does that work again. So it comes around and she's daydreaming at the castle. She hears tales of a ball and sure enough, the invitation comes and all eligible females in the kingdom are to come to the ball and to meet the prince where he will pick out his wife. So she goes and decides to take her mother's dress and convert it back into her own. The little mice help as well. And they have a wonderful little song that they sing as they do this. Now, once the sisters find out they are very displeased. So they terrify her dress to shreds. At this point, they leave for the ball and she runs to the garden to cry.

Well, the most recent thing that happened to me was that work, uh, in April of 2018, on 11th, I was photographing a mobile crane that was picking up a piece of electrical equipment from, um, concrete slab where high voltage power supplies are the power the Neutron Accelerator. And I wasn't being careful because I was looking through the camera and I took one too many steps to the left from about 4 ft off the ground and was above an area that was gravel and the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact embedded in concrete. So, as I took one step too many and tumbled off the left side in, instinctively put out my elbow to stop myself and, uh, the elbow hit and I was lying there for a bit, a bit winded and electricians came over and, uh, checked on me and I said, oh, I'm fine. You know, I'll, I'll get up, I'll be up in a minute. But then I realized I really couldn't stand up because my leg hurt and the left arm elbow was swelling up and a very, very swollen and I couldn't, not move my lower arm at all. So they asked if they should, uh, call an ambulance. And I said, oh, that's really not necessary. And I'll probably be ok in a bit. But, uh, the longer I was there, the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg, which turned out to be a very minor problem, but the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I was flying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the forties that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting shivers and, and they did in fact call an ambulance who came and when they came over to check on how to get me out of there because it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up and it wasn't really, obviously they couldn't just pick me up and get me out of there. But uh first they wanted to check to see if I had had head injuries. So they, they asked me some questions and one of the questions was where I was. So I told them I was at the uh cyclotron doting. But by that point, it was known as the uh a a hall which is the uh Science and Accelerator Technology Hall. But it had also changed its name to the mess hall, which was the uh multidisciplinary Science and accelerator Technology Hall and no Science Hall, of course, they didn't know any of that. And, but the worst, the worst question was that I was hoping they weren't gonna ask me who the President was. So I said, please don't ask me that. So they wrapped some uh kind of canvas strap around me to keep the arm stabilized.

And so basically, he was like all over from collarbone all the way down to the bicep and, you know, lots of nerves in there or whatever. So he's like it, it was rough. So I understand that.

I don't know what to do because I was remembering what the nurse said that I, you know, 24 hours and it was kind of like, it did concern me the night before. So I was like, I don't know, I don't know. And he said, well, Bridget, he said, you um II, I got to see everybody else on the floor.

And she kind of looks at the castle and she like dreams of, you know, kind of going and meeting the prince and living a better life. So one day um they, the castle decides that they, the prince needs to marry and needs a princess. So they decided to have a ball for him to meet someone to marry and her household gets an invitation. So, Cinderella gets excited and learns to sew and sews a really pretty dress and it's a really pretty necklace and, um, she gets all her chores on and gets ready to go to the ball and then her stepsisters decide, well, like they don't want her to go, they don't like her. It was cheaper. So they tear up her dress and ruin everything. Um So no, she can't go to the ball. Um, and they dress up and they go without her and while she is crying, her fairy godmother appears, um, and all throughout this, sure, they're singing a bunch of random songs that I don't know. But then, um, so she makes Cinderella a really pretty dress with glass slippers. And uh the whole while, while Cinderella was growing up without friends, she befriended like her household animals, like the mice and like the horses and, and whatnot. So the fairy godmother turns, turns them all into like a really nice carriage that carries made of the pumpkin and the mice or the drivers and the horse become like the beautiful white horses and they take her and her dress to the, to the ball, but she has to be back by midnight or everything will turn back to normal, it'll be her like that dress and the car will turn back into the pumpkin. So she goes to the ball and people don't recognize her and she dances with the prince and then all of a sudden she realized the clock is about to strike midnight. So she runs away and she was the glass slipper while she's running away. And, um, so, yeah, she gets, she gets halfway back from what I remember and the car turns back into pumpkin and she turns back into her, her ripped dress. But the one glass slipper she still has stays the same. So, um and she's really happy, she has a great night and then the prince comes like sending all of his, his men and guards looking for Cinderella by seeing if the who's like the glass slipper fits. So, um Cinderella's step sisters end up blocking her away and then her mice friends bring her a key to get her out of there. Um And uh the prince's servant comes with the glass slipper to put it on Cinderella. And as he's like running and seeing that there's like another girl who hasn't tried the slipper on in the city or in the town, um The stepmother tricks him and the glass slipper breaks and everyone's all sad. He's not the lover behind this girl. And then some girls like, well, I have the other glass ofer and if it"}, {"segment_name": "wright40a_472028_710033.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok, little boy is leaving the house with his backpack and his mother is going to give him an umbrella but he declines the umbrella.

So and he gets the umbrella and now he's drier. The end story of Cinderella. Cinderella lived with her father and her dog one day, he brings home a new wife and her two daughters. Now the father has to go away and leaves the stepmother in charge her daughters. The step sisters are evil and mean and the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry. They get a notice because the prince has to get married and the king is just beside himself. He must find a wife. So they're going to have a ball so that he can pick out a wife. And Cinderella says, oh, may I go too well if you get all of your chores done and then help your sisters get ready, then if you have any time you can go with us. So they give her all kinds of work to do. In the meantime, her little friends to mice help with getting her dress ready. Now, the evil step sisters have thrown things away that they don't want. They're no good. So they take them and make her dress. She has this pretty little dress and she's ready on time. The evil stepsisters take the, the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress and off. They go to the ball. Cinderella is very, very sad sitting outside crying to her mice friends and her dog. When her fairy godmother comes and says, well, you get to go to the ball and she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses and takes her over to the ball. She looks very nice. She dances with prince charming. They have a wonderful time, but she has to be back by midnight. So when the clock strikes 12, she runs down the stairs but she loses a slipper, one of her glass slippers, she gets home just in time, but she has to walk because the pumpkin, the carriage turn back into a pumpkin, the horses turned back into mice and the dog, the footman turned back into a dog. So then, um, the, I guess the duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in the shoe and asking all the maidens throughout the village. So they get to Cinderella's house and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom so that she can't try it on just in case.

Um So, so, so Cinderella lived in a home with her uncle and a little dog. And there was an opportunity for her uncle to send Cinderella to live with uh a relative and her daughters, which were Cinderella's cousins. And the hope was that they would all become friends and that Cinderella would enjoy having um people like sisters around her. But what happened instead is that she was put in a position of, of servitude with her aunt and cousins and she actually became um kind of an indentured servant. So she would serve them and clean and she didn't even live in the house. She lived with the barn animals who became her friends. Um And she would daydream in the barn about visiting a castle in the kingdom that was far away, but she could see it in the valley in the distance, but she imagined it would be a long, long distance to ever be able to visit the castle. But one day, an invitation came from the prince that he was having a ball and he invited Cinderella's aunts and sisters and she assumed that she could go and her barnyard friends revealed a secret chest to her, uh which she opened to a book of Magic. And from that book of magic, she was able to conjure a dress and pearls to wear to this gown to this event. And she arrived to accompany her, her kin and they absolutely rejected the possibility of her going. They ripped the neck off her neck and she was in despair. So from this treasure chest and this book of magic, a fairy godmother appeared a, a wise powerful older woman and she granted Cinderella's wish of attending the ball, but to do so, she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance. So surrender, Cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and new hair and makeup. So she was virtually unrecognizable. And as a final touch, her fairy godmother created a pumpkin coach and a, a fleet of horses to take her to this special box."}, {"segment_name": "richardson184_304353_542266.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. So um it starts off with Cinderella. I don't know if it's her actual name. I don't think it is. Anyway, um she's a young girl and her dad um remarries and the stepmom has two daughters of her own. Um Then when the stepdad die or the, the dad dies, um Cinderella is left on her own with her stepmom and her two stepsisters. Um and she's kind of made to be um made to be made and um she, she had um ok, and then the next picture is like her playing with a cat. Um So she's responsible for all the chores. Um Then um they get an invitation to the ball and the two stepsisters are really excited. Um And Cinderella wants to go as well. Um So the mice make her dress um with the stepsister's, it's leftover materials. Um But when the stepsisters see that they or that her dress is like made of all their unwanted clothes, um they rip it up so she's really sad and um she goes out in the garden and the God fairy godmother comes to her and um makes her, makes her a Yeah, it's called, not a wagon.

Um I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Yeah, I would take two pieces of bread.

And it actually was the spring. It was in early April quite a long time ago and I came home and I found, um, my kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home. It was unspeakable. Um, and it was devastating because I came to this place with this vision of safety for my animal. So it was very, very upsetting and um I went through grief. Um, and then I did some prayers and time passed and it was coming up on summer solstice. So it was in June and I started imagining because the kit I lost was a girl. She was my only female. Um, and I thought, gosh, my household really needs a female kitty. And if, if, if a cat would just happen to cross my path, I would consider adopting a female. And if that cat just happened to be a tortoise shell, that would be even better. So I went to a party, um, hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country and she was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born, um, on her land and it was one left and she was just a little tortoiseshell female kitty.

Um, the janitor at school was taking a break in the lounge which happens to be near the soccer field. Some kids were playing on the field outside practicing and one of them kicked a ball and it went through the window into the lounge and knocked over a lamp next to where the janitor was sitting.

I had a severe concussion. I had a kidney laceration, broken ribs and four pelvic fractures. So that, uh, let's see, I was taken to a hospital on the east side. My almost husband picked up my Children and took them to my mother. I was in the hospital for two weeks and, uh, I couldn't, when I was released, I was on crutches with no weight bearing for, uh, most of the summer. Um, we used a wheelchair and I just kind of managed to heal. And in, let's see. So that was, uh, I had no complications after that. And then I think it was three months almost exactly that I was able to walk again and we were married. So that's the biggest thing that's happened to me. Wow. All right. For your next prompt. I'm gonna ask, uh, can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating such as my husband if you wish? Is that all right to use? Yes. Yes, of course.

Um, one story that I can think of, we, he was able to drive, uh, but not use a phone, which he still doesn't really use a phone and we were supposed to meet at a hotel on the north side of Indianapolis for some sort of a meeting. I can't remember what it was and he was coming separately and I got there and time went on and went on what I learned from this. He was driving up and down Meridian street. He knew it was a hotel, he knew it was somewhere on Meridian street, but he didn't know which hotel and he had no way to call me and I had no way to call him and what I learned from that experience. And I, I can't say I'm 100% perfect on it even today. But his auditory comprehension is horrible. And if I want to be sure he understands it needs to be written down because he understands what he sees. But like most people with Aphasia, they are the best fakers in the world, but they don't really mean to be. They just want to have it be the way it used to be. And so they'll nod their head. Yeah, they understand. And they don't understand. I've asked him for something from my garage and he'll come in with something instead of saying ha. So I know he didn't understand.

There's a gentleman sitting in the living room, um, next to the window and the ball comes through the broken window and knocks over the lamp and the man picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window to see if he can tell where the soccer ball came from. A little boy is leaving the house and his mother tries to get him to take an umbrella with him. But he is so happy not to have the umbrella. And when he opens the door, it is not raining. And so he talks her out of giving him the umbrella. But when he gets out and is walking away from the house, it begins to rain.

I thought maybe I had a brain tumor or something really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned on going to uh Universal Studios and I wasn't in pain. So, but I was just having a hard time walking, starts at your fingers and toes and then it works, works in. So I can't, I can remember this going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair. So by that evening, by the time we all go back to our hotel, I was really uh quite concerned I did sleep. And the next morning they took me to uh Scripps Medical Center. In the San Diego area and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Guillain Barre, um, a affects, it's, it's an autoimmune disease. And he asked me if I had had the flu recently and I had, and so the, the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system and this was what was happening. So they told first they want to admit me to the hospital and I said, no way. I, I was going back to Phoenix. Uh, oh, and they did, they asked me to like shuffle a deck of cards. I couldn't do that and, uh, snap my fingers. I couldn't do that. So I got back in the car with my friends and my daughter was with us. And, uh, he said if you have trouble breathing because it can go all the way and it's, you know, affects your muscle, affects your muscles to find the nearest hospital. But I got back home. And, uh, it took me about six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery for about six weeks. I couldn't drive a car. I couldn't, um, I could feed myself, but I couldn't cut anything up. I could shower, but I couldn't turn on the shower. I had no strength in my hands or my feet. I couldn't stand on my toes any of that kind of thing. So then I started it, wherever it goes, you know, from the inside, from the outside to the inside of your body and then it stops and it, your body stops, starts healing again. Then it was a slow recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit. But I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister. She was living with us at the time and I just felt like an old lady and this was over 20 years ago. So I was in my forties and I was just holding on to the grocery cart for dear life because my balance was so poor and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over. But I recovered. I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands.

And so I saw another doctor and he gave me blood pressure medication and I continued to work, work, work, work. Um, finally in October, my doctor came back and I went back to her with a list of symptoms and she decided I needed a stress test because I never had one. And this was a nuclear stress test. So I took my stress test and the doctor turned his back and started talking to his assistant and I thought, oh, and he turned and looked at me and said you have flunked your stress test and I want you back in one of my rooms immediately. I think you have considerable um cardiovascular problems. So anyway, um he wanted me to go into the hospital the next day for a heart cath and I told him, I was sorry, I couldn't do that. I, I had an, a real state appointment that was very, very important to me and to the lady that I was working with. And he said, what about Thursday? And I said I can't do it Thursday. And he's, his glasses are going further down on his nose. He said, how about Friday? And I said that'll work. I can, I can do it Friday. So, anyway, I go for my heart on Friday and, um, he didn't even let me sit up afterwards. He said you have blockages and I want you to have surgery today. And so, um, I had triple bypass surgery that afternoon. And, um, so that was pretty traumatic because my family never thought of me as ever being sick. It was, they worried a lot about their father, but they didn't worry about mom because I was constantly going and doing and everything. So, anyway, I had the surgery. Um, my recovery was, was good. I had a good attitude. I never once got depressed because I felt so grateful that, that it had my problems had been found and I could go on and, um, so I went to cardiac rehab at Central Baptist and I did everything they told me to do and, um, I was in rehab for probably about six months and, um, have recovered. Um, however, two years later, I did find that two of my bypasses were blocked and it's, um, it's a genetic thing. I've done everything I was told to do a diet. I'd been doing the diet thing for years. And so I had to have a stent and then a year later I had to have another stance. Um, so since then I have done well. It's, um, it's been two years now since I had a stance. And, um, I'm, I'm back to normal as far as I'm concerned.

The wolf goes up to Red Riding Hood and he says what you got there a kid because he doesn't have many social graces because he was, he's a wolf. He was raised as a, in a wolf pack. And so he doesn't know how creepy this is, but he also kind of wants to eat her. So he's a little bit aware of how creepy this is. And Red Riding Hood's like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers and the wolf says, show me what you've got in your basket and he rifles through a basket because obviously he can take it. He's a wolf and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own because that's smart and I'm not sure what happens. I guess you just, he's like he talks to her, that's what it is. He talks to her and he says what you're doing with this basket kid. And because she is six years old and not very smart, she says I'm going to my grandma's with it. She's sick she is up in that hill, you take a left at the lightning struck tree and a right at the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then you just keep going straight over the bridge and there's my grandma's cottage. She gives him really explicit instructions to how to get to her grandma's cottage because she's six years old and the wolf drops the basket and he says, oh, that sounds great. Bye. I'm never gonna see you again. Don't look for me at your grandma's place. I'm definitely not going there and he bounds off in the direction of the lightning strip tree in the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger and little red Riding hood says that was completely ordinary. I see nothing suspicious about this and she picks up all the stuff and puts it back in the basket and starts going on to grandma's. And obviously before she gets there, the wolf gets to grandma's cottage and he listens at the door and he hears grandma singing along to Led Zeppelin and says, grandma clearly can't hear me because she's singing along to that heavy metal music. So he opens the door and he knocks grandma out and ties her up and put her in the closet where she just sits there, kind of sniffling and humming. Led Zeppelin to herself and he turns down her crazy tunes and gets into her bed. No, no, he has to make, he has to take her clothes first, he's a weird wolf. Social grace is not his forte. He gets grandma onto her underwear, puts on grandma's night and like her cap and stuff. He doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too. But he puts on her night cap and then he ties her up and stuffs her in her closet to sniffle and humbled Zeppelin and he gets into her bed and he pulls the covers up right here and waits for little red white hood and little riding hood comes up to grandma's door eventually, probably like half an hour later because she's six. And she knocks on the door and the wolf says, oh, come in dearie. Little red riding hood says that's weird. My grandma never calls me dearie, but I trust this situation implicitly. And so she comes in and she looks over to the bed and her first response is not, there's a wolf in my grandma's bed. Her first response is hi, grandma, I'm six and I'm stupid and she goes up to the bed and her grandma says, oh, her grandma, the wolf says, oh, why did you bring me dear? And she says, well, I brought you stuff for my mom because I heard you were sick from dancing naked in the rain. You need to not do that so often. But you should also tell me what to do to dance better in the rain naked. And the wolf says, ok, he doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain.

I think that's what happened in the original story. I don't know what Disney said, but that's not important because what is important is that when she was a little girl, little cheerful girl, very nice. Her father remarried to this not very nice woman who had two, not very nice daughters who had big noses and angry eyes and basically, I'm pretty sure her father died also. Um I don't remember that from the movie. I figure it must have been, you know, too tragic for kids, but it's grandmother's thing, they kill everybody's parents off. So, Cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters and no parental, you know, oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the servant, basically the slave of this family, she doesn't get paid. Um And her only friends are the cute little furry animals like mice and dogs and horses. There's a cat named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure aptly named um there's a Captain Lucifer who belongs to the step family who is always terrorizing her mice friends. And so she has to protect them and they're all, you know, good buddies, they sing songs together. And then one day the king in the castle in the distance, very far away, Cinderella looks lonely out the window because she wants something she can't have because that is the fundamental past that in existence. The king says to his advisor, I want my son to get married because he's getting on in years and he wants a grandkid pretty much is his only motivation for that, which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your hea parent to get married to me. But the heart wants what it wants. And so he decide the king decides to throw this enormous ball to which every single eligible maiden in the kingdom will be invited and biological maiden. I mean, probably over the age of 13 and not already married. The trouble is probably negotiable. So the step family and Cinderella get the invitation and they're all psyched because this is great. One of them could marry the prince, not Cinderella, obviously because she's hideous and not worth it. But one of the stepdaughters could. And so leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited. And Cinderella, her mice and bird buddies make her a dress because they want her to go to the ball also because they're just nice. They're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this and she gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball and she puts on the dress and she goes downstairs to meet her stepfamily at the door for them to get into the carriage to go off to the ball. And they say to themselves, yeah. And they rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable. So she can't go to the ball because they're mean. And at this point, Cinderella is kind of crying to herself and I'm inclined to be like crying to herself because she's a baby. But also I would probably cry because that was a nice dress. And like if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she's sitting there crying and all of a sudden her fairy godmother comes why she has a fairy godmother? Nobody's really sure. Presumably because she's so pure of heart. But a fairy godmother comes and says, and everything is wonderful. And the pumpkin turns into a carriage, the dogs turn into horses."}, {"segment_name": "richardson17_1101887_1339604.wav", "aws_transcription": "Yeah, because she's so pretty but she won't stay that way.

So she wakes up and they're in love and the doors are happy and we all learn, the more of the story is to just maim people instead of kill them and not accept food from strangers. The end they live happily ever after. Now, I want you to tell me as much of the story of Little Red Riding Hood as you can. You can use any details, you know about the story as well as pictures you just looked at. Ok, once upon a time, there was a girl and because she went everywhere and her red cape, everybody called her little Red Riding Hood. Ok. So little Red Riding Hood lives at her house with her parents. And one day her mother says to her little Red Riding Hood, I'm going to prepare a basket for you to take to your grandmother's house. And I even think that her mother and gives her advice about the path to take to grandmother's house to take the, you know, the most direct path and not to lollygag because that's when travel happens. And so little Red Riding Hood, actually, I think in the, in my story, Little Red Riding Hood actually wants to take the rest right path. But the there's some reason why she can't and I think it has something to do with a sign posts being, oh, I know why because the wolf spies little Red Riding coming with a bag skip to her grandmother's house. And he says, oh little girl, where are you going? And she says I'm going to my brother's house. You shouldn't talk to strangers. That's bad and don't tell them where you're going. And so he jumps ahead of her in the path on the way to her grandmother's house and switches the sign. So as to delay her arriving at her grandmother's house. So the wolf goes to grandmother's house and he um, oh, doesn't knock on the door. That's a different story. He gets into the grandmother's house and he gobbles her up whole that's important. And um little meanwhile, little little Red Riding Hood Hood is un un un does not know that this happened and the wolf who I think his end objective is to eat Little Red Riding Hood, which you would think he'd be stated by eating grandma, but he's not, um, puts on grandmother's clothes and gets into her bed which isn't creep. It's a fairy tale. Um, and when little Red Riding Hood arrives, he blurs her end, um, by asking my grandmother and then, um, little red R hood notices keen, little Red Riding Hood keenly notices that her grandmother's acting really weird.

But, uh, I'm, I'm willing to have more patients and it, it appears to be working. The most important event that comes to mind right now is the fact that I got married in October 07.

I trained her first husband, uh as an equipment salesman for a central school supply company. And we had been friends ever since and upon the occasion of a divorce in 1991 in Henderson, Kentucky.

But boy, she's in a really dangerous place. Cinderella was a beautiful little girl and she had three stepsisters and the steps sisters were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful. And so they didn't treat her very well. She had to do all the scrubbing and the cleaning while the, the steps sisters went about their way and had the pretty clothes and all that. There was going to be a ball at the palace and it was for the prints to try to find a bride. And um, so the steps sisters were very excited about the ball and of course they weren't going to let Cinderella go. And um, so they got all dressed up and they went to the ball and Cinderella is just very upset that she couldn't go. She's just kind of wistfully looking out the window at the palace and suddenly her very godmother appears and um tells her that she wants her to go to the ball and she dresses her in a beautiful dress and has a carriage waiting for her outside with drawn by horses and I believe it was a pumpkin or maybe it turned into a pumpkin.

You'll be able to go to the, the mall. And so the fairy godmother waved her magic wand and the mice and a pumpkin that were sitting there turned into a coach, the footman, the driver and the horses. So they were able to have a coach, but Cinderella still didn't have a dress. So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand and Cinderella got a beautiful dress just magically appeared on her. It was a very beautiful dress and her hair was all done up nice. So she was able to get into the coach. And if your godmother told her only one thing you need to do, you need to be home before the stroke of midnight. Because at the after the stroke of midnight, the chariot, the this I'm looking for my word, the um the carriage that she went in after midnight would go, everything would change back to what it was. So she went to the dance, the ball and the prince saw her and he was just taken with her and he went and asked her to dance and they danced many dances and her stepsisters and her stepmother didn't re recognize that it was her. So she danced and she danced and then she started to hear the stroke of midnight and it was like, oh no, I've got to get out of here.

So I will tell you a different story. Um, when I, I, uh, I have asthma that is very well controlled, but I, you know, had a, a host of different kinds of, uh, less controlled moments growing up with asthma before there were, uh, the quality of, um, y you know, maintenance treatments that there are now for asthma. So, I, uh, and my asthma is, uh, most frequently triggered by a allergy issues and in particular, I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle because they're nonshedding dogs. And I am allergic to all cats very badly. And I'm also allergic to, you know, trees and various mold grasses. Ya, ya, ya. But, uh, cats are probably the worst culprit for me. Um, so when I was in high school, probably a freshman or sophomore in high school, I think, um, my sisters were out of the house at that point. So it was just me living with my mom and dad in one summer we took a vacation, uh, down. No, it was in the fall. It was in the fall and we went down for like an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why did not really think about the fact that they had two dogs and a cat, I believe, shedding dogs and a cat. So we were gonna stay two nights with them. So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner and I could tell I was starting to feel and, and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother, having been, my mother always could look across the room and when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say it's time for you to go, isn't it? Um So we kind of reached that point, but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room, people try that kind of thing, which of course, never works because the animal lives there. Um And I, and I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there. But we did and, or maybe I said, oh, I'll be ok, I'll be OK. I took medicine and, and um whatnot. But by the middle of the night I was beyond ok. And it was, you know, to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe. And there were no inhalers back in those days, it was liquid medicine that A was less effective. And b took a long time to activate. Plus, if you stay in the space where the stimulus is, your medicine is only gonna last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night I could bear it no longer. And my loving, loving father, um said, uh let's go to the car and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night. And I, so then the next day I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were, but we spent enough time in the house. I just couldn't get past it. I was, I was so, um, affected and I am not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did stay in that house that night, but it just continued to get worse. And by that next evening we had to go to the, er, and back in those days, I suppose they do something.

And these Children have uh traumatic uh brain damage or they're severely disabled where they, they barely can function. They're usually in, they are in wheelchairs. Um, all their ad LS are done for them. They are, they don't communicate at all verbally. And so basically, the only way that you can communicate with them a lot is um by their affect, um by the way, maybe their eyes, how their eyes are turning in or out or if they're looking at you, um, the way that you touch them, um, um, maybe just communicating. Um, some of them, um, well, I have several classes, there's another class that's MO MD which is a little more advanced. And so in that class, we communicate by sign language like this would be um, you know, please or you know, something like this like it, the doctor or the nurse. So sometimes we do sign language with those kids and we can communicate with them that way. Ok. In the beginning of the story, it looks like there is this little girl, oh, probably between an eight and 10 year old little girl. And somehow I don't know how she got into a raging rear of it. It looks really cold. Um, and the firemen or paramedic is coming to rescue her and he has all his equipment on and basically he has to go out into this raging river. Um, and he's grabbing on to some kind of, um, tree limb, a branch or something um, for his support and then he's got some kind of a build or something to, to pull her in or to help her to help her in, but he's also out there. Um, and in danger in his life too. Ok. There's this little boy, probably 10, 12 years old and he's out playing soccer just having a really fun time. And um, the ball goes through possibly maybe the neighbor's window or maybe it's his own front window and um, the ball knocks over a lamp. So actually it breaks the window glass and also a lamp and the man was sitting in a chair and then he picks up the ball and he looks out the window and that's all in those pictures. So I don't know what the end of the story is. I don't know what the little boy does. I love this one because this is typical, typical of kids and mothers. Ok. So the little boy is getting ready to go to school. He has that pack on and his mom says, I think it's gonna rain today. We take the umbrella umbrella and the little boy goes, no, I'm not gonna take it. It's not gonna rain. Trust me. Ok, kids think they're smarter than their parents but they're not. And the mom says you need the umbrella but he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside and it starts to ring ha ha ha. And so the little boy comes back home and he's um, he's soaking wet and he comes back in and his mother is a little upset with them because in her mind, she said I told you. So why don't you listen to me? And he's stopping wet. And so he takes the umbrella and he goes to school and I hope you learn to listen to.

Here's your family. Uh You now have a new mother and you have new sisters go along with it. Well, what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet and they treated Cinderella horribly. They made her do all the cooking, they made her do all the cleaning while he was off sailing around the world. That's why I wasn't around. That's why I didn't know what was going on. So, uh the Cinderella is having to do all the housework and she's taking care of everything and the evil step sisters are just, you know, bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do. So, Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were uh there in the farm area and she would talk to them and they would talk to her because they had that special communication. Um Then one day from where Cinderella was at, she, when she was talking with the animals, she could see like the whole town that she lived in and off in the distance, she could see the castle where the prince lived. And she always thought, wow, it would be so neat if I could live in a castle, that would just be amazing. But I'm Cinderella and I won't ever happen because I have to make sure that I have to take care of my stepmother and my evil stepsisters. Meanwhile, over in the castle, uh the advisor to the prince is starting to get worried because the prince is still single and people in the town are starting to talk. So he's a little bit worried about it. So he says, ok, here's what we'll do. We will put this whole proclamation thing out and we will get all the single ladies to come to the castle and we'll let the prince pick one, you know, with all the women, there's got to be one that he's gonna like. So we'll bring them all here. So they send out a message to everybody in the village in the town. They say, ok, we're having this big birthday party for the prince, bring your single daughters over here and because he's gonna be picking a wife and the evil stepmother gets this message and she says, well, this is great. I'm gonna put my daughters because then we can get out of this L and move back to a big castle and we'll be all rich and famous. And Cinderella thinks, wow, that'd be kind of cool. Um, maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at, you know, sewing and everything and I've actually made a dress. So, you know, I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters. So she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room and the stepsisters see it and decide, wow, she looks a lot better than we do. So we can't let that happen. So they rip up her dress and then they take her and they like, shove her in a closet and lock her away and then they take off and go and Cinderella is really sad and she's like, oh, no, this is really a bummer. And while she's upset, she finds this book and while flipping through the book, she sees a reference to a fairy godmother. So she reads the reference and all of a sudden fairy godmother shows up and she says, well, Cinderella, I'm here to help you out. Uh, because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things. I'm gonna grant you some wishes and we're gonna get you to this ball and So Cinderella says, ok, well, what do, how do we make this happen? She said, well, first we need a way to get you there. So she takes Cinderella's little animal friends and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her to the mall.

She was very upset because she couldn't get her cat down. So she yelled for her dad who was in the house to see if he could help. So he tried to climb up the tree and get the cat, but he wasn't able to reach the cat either. And the dog continued to bark at the base of the tree. The next thing that happened was the little girl's mother called the fire department to see if they could come and help.

I had rheumatic fever and they always told me, well, your immune system isn't going to be near as strong. So, make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery, including oral surgery. So I did that. And yet that evening, I, early evening, my throat swelled up.

And they also took a syringe and sprayed it on my throat to help the swelling go down. Uh, shortly after that, I was diagnosed with something called a, uh, they called it then angio neurotic edema. Uh, but it's since been re diagnosed or reclassified as now called hereditary angioedema. Uh The difference between angioedema and hereditary angioma is that angioedema which is like the hives can be treated with antihistamines, hereditary angioedema.

They started an IV on me and the doctor, I don't know if she was a doctor or P A. Um, anyway, she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline in the IV. And anybody who's ever had adrenaline knows that's the wrong place to give it. It goes intermuscular. It can't, it's not to be intravenous.

So now little Cinderella, his daughter has two stepsisters. They grow up in the house together, but they are very, very different Children. The two steps sisters are very vain, very selfish and force Cinderella to do all the work in the house instead of them helping out. And the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen. So Cinderella because she works so hard, has no friends and except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house and they befriend her. She sees the princess castle from afar and often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle as a princess. Meanwhile, in that castle, there's a prince and the prince's father is very frustrated because his son is just not interested in meeting women and marrying and the king is definitely ready for his son to get married. So he decides to host a ball and bring all the beautiful ladies of the area to the ball. And so he sends out invitations. And when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations, the girls are very, very excited because now they can see themselves married to the prince. And Cinderella also shares in this dream. However, Cinderella's stepmother says, oh no, you can't go to the ball because you have too many chores to do and forces Cinderella to do even more chores because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters and does not want that competition for her daughters. So they get all ready to go to the ball and Cinderella goes through all her chores, but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also. So they help her with the chores. But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball because she doesn't have dress. And so in a puff of magic, her very godmother comes to her and says I will help you Cinderella. So she um makes a beautiful dress up here with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball that is made out of a pumpkin and the mice, she waves her magic wand and makes into fine horses that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball. So in the meantime, just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though she says, remember the spell is only good until midnight. And after midnight, the coach will turn back into a pumpkin and your little, the horses will turn back into your little friends again. So make sure you're out of there by midnight. So Cinderella goes to the ball and nobody recognizes her because she's dressed beautifully. She's clean, she smells good and the prince is so taken with her. He cannot believe his luck that he has found this beautiful young woman and falls in love with her, instantly love at first sight. Um, but as they're taking one of their last dances, she hears the gong from the clock tower and knows that it is midnight and she knows she has to leave quickly, but he doesn't want her to leave and he holds her back and she says, no, I must go and she runs out of his arms, runs down the stairs, trips just a little bit before she gets into her coat."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL5-2_421728_659214.wav", "aws_transcription": "All right. Uh I don't know if you've heard this or not, if I mention this. Uh One of the things that I have been doing for the last 10, 12 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis at Riley Children's Hospital. And it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or uh has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So, um I very much have learned from that a not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them. And that has that is a lesson because it's easy to make that assumption as I'm sure, you know. Um So I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact, from their facial expressions, from their um emotions that may be jerky, that may be just excitement that that is a response to the story. And while I can, I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understanding and capacity with this story, I can sense their emotional and response to whatever it is that they do understand in this story. And it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection even when there is no speech coming back on their end. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from you or a kid or more recently, I'm gonna mute myself now and you can begin. OK. Uh This time, I will tell you about the birth of my first child. Um So, uh it was 22 years ago. Uh on March 14th, I was due on March 9th. I had the good fortune of having a fairly benign, um, you know, easy pregnancy. Uh and nothing had happened, nothing had happened. We were on to day five after the due date and I, that day was singing in AAA very unusual thing singing with a choir that I was part of a small chamber group. I should say that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So, um I went to the wedding and we sang and I did kind of notice that um I, you know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there but, you know, whatever. Uh and, and the wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I, I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial. And um I called my sister who lived, I was in Sacramento at the time. She was in southern California and she is five years older than me and three kids older than me.

Where I keep the garbage bags. So, uh she came back with uh garbage bags and she had cleared off the shelf where I keep the garbage bags. But horse blankets is as big as this table and the shelf I keep the garbage bags on is maybe six inches high. So she still brought me the garbage bags and she gave me a very puzzled look like she was what I was gonna do with them. So I hold the bag out, let me get the blanket for you and I pull up the blanket and I put it in a garbage bag and she said, how's this gonna fit on the shelf? I said I wasn't gonna put it on the shelf, just, just gonna bag it up for the winter.

Maybe she was in junior high. We were in elementary school and Nina hid in the closet in the guest room and the closet door got stuck and she couldn't get out of the closet door and we started to panic and she started to panic and she started to cry and bang on the door and we couldn't get a hold of her mom at dinner. This is before cell phones. We're trying to, their mom didn't tell us what restaurant she went to. She'd have a cell phone.

And, um, eventually my allergic reaction was traced to my tonsils and my tonsils. So they, they took away my tonsils. And I remember being said, ice cream, all the ice cream you can eat after the operation. And once that was taken away, I was back to normal. Um, one of the things that have stuck in my mind, as I say, I can't remember exactly, but I think I was about four and this thing went on for about three months. So, one of the things that, uh, I remember was that I was not supposed to move very much. I was supposed to, uh, be in bed and not moving very much. And whenever I was left alone, I remember that I would jump on the bed as a sign of rebellion against this order. This doctor's order that I was to in state, you know, lie, just lie as, as still as I could, which was impossible to expect a four year old to to follow that. So that's one of the things I remember. Um I also remember the doctor coming into because I was put in my parents' bedroom, which was larger than my own during the day. And uh just one of the images I have was this doctor would come and he would take the lampshade of the sign, be a side table lamp and put it on my head as a hat. And he did that like three or four times and then I didn't like it that much, but he kept doing it. He thought it was a funny joke. And uh, so it's one of the things that I've stuck with. But so that was not a stroke. It wasn't a mental thing, but it wasn't allergic reaction to my tonsils. So, the next thing I'd like to ask is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? That's a very broad range of what we could mean by that. Um But if you, if you can, yeah, died of Alzheimer's. Ok. So that you can probably, uh, in that case, um, please tell me kind of what the issues or problems were and what you did to try to communicate with that person. Ok. Um, I of course, stood sort of second row to the problem. My father-in-law and my, my wife at the time were the most affected by it. And I remember trying to, to find things that you would be able to have a conversation about, um, which has, as the illness progressed, it was, it became more and more difficult all the time.

Um and she played with the animals and she slept and did everything. Um And then she dreamed of going to the palace and like having a better life. Um And one day the stepmom got an invitation to a ball at the castle and um she was, well, the stepmom and the stepsisters are very excited and they began to get ready and then she um Cinderella wanted to go as well, but they didn't want her to go. Um And so she put on, she didn't have the best dress and then she put it on and then they ruined it and uh pulled her necklace off and broke it and everything and then they all left to go to the ball and Cinderella was at home. Um and she started crying and then her very godmother appeared and um like told her that she could go until midnight. And then she had a carriage made out of a pumpkin, um, horses and a nice dress and her hair was done and everything. Um And so she went to the ball and everyone was like, amazed at this beautiful person and they wanted to know who it was and she danced with the prince. Um, but then she realized it was almost midnight and so all of her stuff would turn back to normal. And so she went back outside and was running off and her glass slipper fell off. Um And then when the prince was trying to follow her, but he couldn't catch up to her, but he found the glass slipper. And so she got back home, her stepsisters and mom came back home and they were all excited and they didn't know that she had went. Um and then the next day, the prince was going around trying to find someone that fit whose foot fit the um slipper glass slipper and finally she tried it on and it fit and they went off and got married and excellent. Ok. And then last, um for this first test, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Ok. Um So first you would need to wash your hands. Um And then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread. Um You take the Thai there's usually a twist pie on the bread to take it off and open the pack. And if it's a brand new pack, you probably might throw away the first piece, the end piece, you probably don't want to use that. But you grab two pieces of bread and you can put them on a plate or a napkin, um, separately. And then you go and grab a knife and, uh, the peanut butter and the jelly. And so first you're gonna choose either the peanut butter or the jelly, but let's just go with the peanut butter. Um, so you'll twist the top off of the peanut butter and stick the knife into it and get some peanut butter on the knife and then you'll use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread. Um, and then you'll go, when you finish spreading the peanut butter, you'll go and wash the knife off and then you'll open your jar of jelly. See, it's probably gonna be a twist top as well. So you're gonna twist it and use the knife and spread the jelly with the knife, um, on the other piece of bread."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto80a_1057361_1294808.wav", "aws_transcription": "So of course, it's a classic.

To start with that, you have to uh take two pieces of bread and select the type of bread that you best like to eat because the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a dining experience. Um It uh you should uh select the type of peanut butter again that you most like, I like crunchy peanut butter and therefore, I would have crunchy, preferably extra crunchy peanut butter. Uh to make the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You would want to uh take a knife and, and apply about one quarter inch of peanut butter evenly over an entire slice of, of uh bread. Finally select the type of jelly or jam that you best prefer. I would prefer probably strawberry preserves with big chunks of strawberry in them. On the other side of the bread, I would apply again another quarter inch or so of strawberry jam. Put it on really nice and thick, put those two pieces of bread together, it should be cut in half and it should be eaten immediately and immediately with a cold glass of milk in this picture. There is a, a series of unfortunate events. It looks like it all started with a cat that climbed up into the tree. Maybe after a bird, the cat is sitting. Actually, it almost looks like it's sleeping very comfortably in the branch. The little girl is standing and jumping underneath the branch trying to get the cat to jump down but is unable to do so. She's unhappy that was followed by her father climbing up into the tree using a ladder to help get the cat down. Unfortunately, the ladder fell down while he was still up in the tree. And so he's stuck in the tree now. Meanwhile, the dog is furiously barking at the base of the tree because dad is stuck up in the tree and the cat is as well. Someone has called the fire department finally to bring another ladder to help get both dad and the cat out of the tree and the firemen are quickly running over to over to the tree, help everyone out the end.

Uh There was a small country road and, um, was going to pass a dump truck, uh, going relatively slowly. Uh, just as I got beside the dump truck, the dump truck made an abrupt, uh, right turn directly in front of me. I ran into this gas tank. Um, the, I went flying off my motorcycle into the ditch on the side of the roll road. Um, and, uh, the truck stopped immediately before actually running over the motorcycle. Um, at that point, the, uh, I knew something was wrong. I was not, it was not very comfortable but not horrible pain. I was in the ditch. The truck driver came over and asked me if I was hurt and I said I was not, I thought something might be wrong but wasn't sure. In the meantime, a farmer who is in the field nearby came over.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella who was brought to live in the palace where two step sisters were an evil stepmother. She was brought there because she was going to be their helper and clean their house and make them dinner and she would live there for the rest of her life. The steps sisters were very mean to Cinderella. They actually um picked at her, made fun of her. And as she grew up, she always wondered as she looked out the window, what it would be like to live in the palace. Soon as she got older, she um she saw that there was an invitation to the grand ball to meet the prince. How exciting this would be to finally go and meet the prince and possibly one day be able to live in the palace. The step sisters were all getting ready to go as well and the evil stepmother was, was making sure that they were going to be greeted by the prince and have an invitation of their very own to meet him in person. Oh, Cinderella thought, I wonder how I would get to the ball. So she opened up a chest and there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were gonna help sew the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace. Soon the step sister found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince as well and they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress. Oh, no, Cinderella thought. Now, what shall I do? How will I ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil step sisters? Then out of nowhere, a beautiful good witch showed up and she granted Cinderella a wish. The wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city that nothing would ever compare. She would also grant her a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince. The only exception was that she would have to be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin. Oh, this is so wonderful. Cinderella said, yes, I have to go. It is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball. Then I shall grant you your wish. Said the good witch. And there she was standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine. Crystals and diamonds everywhere. And the beautiful horse carriage and off she went to the palace there, everyone stood in line to meet the prince. Finally, Cinderella got her turn and there she was. Oh no. She said it's almost 12. I cannot finish my dance with the prince. So she hurriedly ran down the stairs and as she ran down the stairs, one of her glass slippers fell off. The prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown? Minutes later, Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags and no riches anymore were on her.

I says, no, you're not either. You call his doctor right now. He's not about to be done that way.

And I told him about what had happened and, and they said, are you afraid? I said, I'm scared to death but he needs help. So, uh, they took him upstairs and the doctor had a school over there. We never saw that doctor again. Don't know what happened to him. I think he lost his job. I don't know. I'm sorry about that, but I wasn't about to let my husband go through another ordeal of their negligence.

I couldn't even lift the cup. And if I had been clean, having to take care of his back, there was no way that I could, I wasn't able to. And so God's plan is better than ours is he gave he healed. His bag is the way I feel that the doctor said would never be, it'd be there. The rest of his life healed his bag so he could take care of me. And then as soon as I went back to work, they told me I'd never work again. I went back to work because they said he would be better than uh if I was working.

The process was a very long, in fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose the cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time, they were trying to figure out what was wrong. And then I remember my family changing the physician and then this physician who saw me for the first time says we need to, we need to take out his tonsils right away. And so I was bedridden and I had to stay in bed. But the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to show that I could do it and contradict the doctor's orders.

He was excluding himself from the classroom, every class, every class. So eventually I said, OK, we, I have a problem here. I tried different things to, you know, make, making him a silent participant in, in plays or kids that we would put on in class. And even that man met with very partial cooperation from him. So I called him to a meeting and then he told me a very long story of how his parents had spent so much money tutoring him or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through high school in math, in English everything. And he had this aversion towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish the reason why he was not participating. He could have been just making it up. But I think he was at least he made the effort of coming to the meeting to explain to me why he would not participate.

I know uh one day Cinderella found out that her family was going to the Princess ball. She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it. She took her time and made her own dress to go with her family because her stepmother and stepsisters would not allow her to be provided. And upon learning that uh she had plans to do this, her stepmother and her stepsisters uh tore the dress from her, tore, tore into it and made it unserviceable to go to the ball with.

And to do this, she transformed a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice, the horses and the birds into appropriate helpers for Cinderella. And she also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers. She however told Cinderella, Cinderella had to be back by midnight or else the magic would wear off. My Cinderella went to the ball had a fabulous time. She was noticed by everyone upon entering, including the prince and the prince asked her to dance. She's going to dance with her over the two stepsisters. Neither of whom recognized it somehow she enjoyed her dance with the prince so much that she lost track of time. And just before it hit 11, she noticed or just before it hit 12, she noticed that the time was about to be up. So she ran from him without an explanation. He chased after her down the steps of the path. She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running.

And I eventually, I called different hospitals at the Med Center and they told me that all the speech was in Bloomington, which I should have known because my sister graduated from that program back when it was not rehab, it was all school, you know, therapy. And, um, I called down there and, and talked to the secretary that answered. And that was the beginning of our relationship with, with the Bloomington speech clinic. And we traveled for 12 years. We drove to Bloomington every week and he gained a lot from it. And we made a lot of wonderful friends between the therapists and the other clients we met.

I had pelvic fractures, ribs, concussion. And I would call my mother, I could remember her phone number and from the very beginning I would call her constantly and I'd say hi. Where am I? Hi. Where am I bless her heart. She just, she'd answer the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we'd do it again, this went on a lot, but as the days went by, the concussion got a little bit better. And, um, I remember they took me to a whirlpool bath and using, uh, you know, a whole harness system to lower me into this tub. And I'm not sure it helped, but it felt good. Um, so I was released from the hospital after two weeks and, um, and my husband came by every evening and, and brought outside food because the hospital food was so terrible. So I went home and I was on crutches with no weight bearing all summer. So this was in about this time in June about maybe June 23rd. And uh we had a wheelchair, we used to when he get home from work, you know, we, we throw the wheelchair in the car and get out of the house because I was getting older, crazy.

However, the stepmother and the stepsisters were not particularly fond of Cinderella because she was so beautiful and all of the animals loved her and her father loved her and everything she did was just sweet and kind and good and they were very jealous. So they made her do all of the worst things. They made her do all of the cooking and all of the cleaning and she didn't get to wear any nice clothes, but she was lucky because she had all the animals as her friends and they encouraged her and were kind to her and they noticed that she would look out at this castle and wonder what life would be like in the castle outside of the place she lived one day. Then the king of that castle wanted his son to meet women in hopes that he would become married and he sent a notice across the village and everyone was very excited, including Cinderella. And so her stepsisters were starting to get all of their things together, what they were gonna wear and what they were gonna do. And Cinderella did the same. She found a book to help her make something and the animals helped her make something. And then her stepsisters were again so jealous and envious of how beautiful she was that they ruined her dress. And Cinderella was very sad and her fairy godmother appeared and turned everything into the most beautiful things ever. Her dress was prettier. She had a lovely carriage and horses to drive the carriage and she went to the ball when she got there, the prince wanted to dance with her because like everyone else, he noticed that she was the kindest gentlest, most beautiful creature in the room. And so they danced and danced and Cinderella noticed it was almost midnight. And her fairy godmother had told her that at the stroke of midnight, everything would turn back to normal and that she needed to be out at the castle by then. So she ran out but on the way, she dropped her shoe, lost a shoe. She went home and was very, very sad and they locked her in a room so she couldn't get out.

And she was like that until for 10 years until she grew up and she they were so mean to her and doing everything bad to her. But one day the mother receives an invitation to go to the king's boil because the king and queen was getting angry with their son, the crown prince and wanted to meet the people in the area because they wanted him to get married.

Um she was always left out and she didn't get any the new clothes and the fancy food and go to a lot of the fancy places. Well, in the area they lived um the kingdom, there was a young prince and he was uh becoming a young man and he was looking for his princess. So they decided they were gonna have this ball and they would invite uh invite all the uh single young girls to this ball and he would choose someone in from those that come to the ball. Well, of course, Cinderella didn't get to go and she was kind of upset. She thought she would want to go really bad. And uh so it just so happened that her fairy godmother appears and said, well, Cinderella, uh if you would like to go, uh we can, we can fix it so you can go. So the uh fairy godmother, she dresses Cinderella up in a very fine gown and bald dress and chair and everything.

Well, uh somewhere along the way, um Cinderella has glass slippers and uh her fairy godmother told her now at a certain time in the ball, you're going to have to leave. And so uh that time comes and Cinderella is getting ready to leave and she runs out of the ballroom and down a flight of stairs and to her carriage and as she does she loses one of her slippers and she jumps in the carriage and they take her back to the house. So she'll be there when the, the rest of the family gets back. And so, um, she's there and they come back and they're telling this story about the ball and everything, the fun they have and what went on. And I'm sure they mentioned this story about, well, he picked this girl and she lost her slipper. The prince decides the next day that he wants to find this girl.

And it actually has made me wonder if maybe he once was a stutterer and if this is his, his way of, of coping with stuttering, but I haven't asked him that. All right. Now, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from any time. Yes. Um, my grandmother was ill. Um, and she didn't tell any of us, but she started losing weight and sleeping a lot and she finally went in and got diagnosed with, um, bowel cancer and it was very, um, confusing and scary for all of us because no one in my family had experience with terminal cancer. Um, and the doctor didn't give clear communication about what we should expect. And so initially, we thought that her cancer could be cured with surgery and later, it was revealed that, you know, this was stage four cancer and there was no way it was going to get better. Um And she very much wanted to stay at home. Um, and I wasn't living in, in my hometown anymore. So it was my mom that was really taking care of her and she could no longer take care of my grandmother. It was just overwhelming. She was having a lot of issues. So we brought her back to the hospital and she kept saying how much she wanted to go home. And mom and my brother who was in medical school at the time said it, it just wasn't possible, we couldn't care for her. I was secretly hoping maybe we could take her home because for me, there's something very sacred about being able to, to be in your space. So that didn't happen. She remained in the hospital and got progressively worse and it happened over a period of weeks and I remember visiting her in a hospital and there was light coming in the window and windows and then she was transferred to another spot.

My kids were sick and then I was feeling sick and I just figured we were all just sick and I, um, my husband had to go out of town. He left on a Sunday night and I wasn't feeling great that morning I got up and I felt awful. The kids were fine by that point. But by Monday morning I felt awful like to the point where I could, I remember feeding the kids breakfast. They had their cereal on the table. They were only three and five at the time and I then just put my head on the kitchen table. I couldn't even lift it up and I called my sister, uh, because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting vehemently and it just, and I had been for a long time, I knew something was not right. And I, because I actually had been sick for several days now that I think about it, um, because I hadn't showered and I called the doctor, they said, yeah, you need to be seen. And, um, and I called my sister and she thought I wanted her to just stay with the kids. And I said, no, I, you have to take me. My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive because I can't not throw up. And so she was like, whatever. Ok. So she came over and I remember wanting to clean myself because I, I hadn't showered for days. I thought I can't go to the doctor. And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I went to, um, I was cleaning under my arm and there was this huge lump I thought to myself, oh my God, I developed breast cancer like overnight. And, uh, but it was like noticeably enlarged. So I, I thought it was strange though because I was sick of my stomach. It didn't seem connected. So my sister took me and she right away understood when she saw me how sick I was. And, and that I kept, you know, having to throw up in the car on the way to the doctor. It was just so bad. I walked in and I, we had just moved to Indianapolis. I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first. That's who saw me. She looked at me and within 10 seconds she said I have never met you in my life. You are very, very sick. I can tell that was like, ok, yeah, let me lay down. I laid down on the table because I couldn't even sit up. So, um, they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually cellulitis and that it had, you know, turned into this horrific infection. So they were quite concerned, um, about my condition. I had to get blood work right away, etcetera. And apparently they told my sister we, uh she is severely, severely ill. And um, like if she probably should be hospitalized, she's very, very dehydrated, but we don't want to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're gonna see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever too.

And this is a story about the time when I was kicking a ball in our yard and it went into our neighbor's window. Our neighbor was a very intelligent young man by the name of Richard Jenkins. And Richard was a writer and also a professor of literature. So when I sent the ball crashing through his window, I thought he was going to be mad and I was very reluctant to go fetch the ball. But eventually I did and he said, look, I will let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me. And that is how I started writing. And I fell so much in love with writing that ever since I have become a writer and I haven't been published, but I have a lot of writings that started with that incident that uh Mr Jenkins induced after I broke his window.

Um we had to, to uh we were caught by a lockdown in her house and I did not attend school, but I did go to a tutor's house because of course, there were no schools. But one day I was getting ready to go to my tutor's home who was doing supplementary work so that I wouldn't miss out on school that was canceled and it was raining, it was raining very hard. So I asked my Aunt Charlotte for an umbrella, but she said, no, I'm not gonna let you use my umbrella. So then I had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realize two things, one that I was getting wet, which was not comfortable. I did not like that. And the second one that I had a very good excuse to get a hold of the umbrella. So I went back to my Aunt Charlotte. I said, look, I could get ill and who knows, I could get, I could catch Coronavirus because of getting ill. So the only way to prevent this is by you're lending me your umbrella. And so faced with this incredible threat. Of course, even a mean old lady like a Charlotte was, would not dare to deny me the umbrella. So she gave me the umbrella and I was able to walk to the tutor's house with the umbrella. Here's a picture, I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right.

Uh, my regular doctor came in, he's a, he's a cardiologist and he came in to check on me too and, uh, they told me to watch my diet not to smoke, which I had for a couple of days. So I just decided that was it. And to do some walking to be more active walking, which I off and on, on that subject. But, and that was about it, on the recovery. It was very mild and communication. I think the problem that I have is with my son. Uh, we're not, uh, as close as I think either one of us want to be. Uh, he's very, um, closed mouth. I don't know much about it what his life is like. Uh, I talk to him maybe once a month, once every five weeks. Uh, there isn't a lot that we talk about. A little bit about his work. Not too much about my life because I'm retired now. We both are avid baseball fans. So we do talk about that and that seems to open up the lines of communication more so than anything else. I guess, one of the nicest things or greatest things that ever happened was when I was single, my first wife had passed away and I had left Ashland and, uh, was living sort of a secluded life on the lake. And I came in to see my dad and then I stopped at the filling station, large one subway filled up with gas and a grandfather. And it was my daughter in law. And, uh, what are you doing here? And I said, well, I'm here to see you dad. And I said, and I said, where are the girls at that time? They were like preschool. And, uh, she says, oh, they're over at, uh, a child development. And I says, oh, you're doing some shopping. She says, yeah, she says I met the lady that runs that place and she wanted to know about you. And I said, how was that? Right? And I said, uh, who is she? And, well, that's Diane. Yeah, gave me the last name and I said, uh, did she ask about you what you were doing and this and that? And I says, where are the girls? They said, well, they're, they're at the child care center. And I says, well, I guess I could stop over and see him. And, uh, the guy, the lady, I said, what did you say? The lady's last name was Stanford. Ok. Well, I went into a men's store that I'm good friends with and I walked in and I said, uh, Betty, that's, that's owner wise. I said, are you a city director?

That's something. Um, well, it's an ongoing affair after 25 years. Um, my husband's aphasia is moderate to severe and after having chemo six years ago, it's even worse. It actually had improved. And, uh, the chemo really made a difference. Excuse me. So, um, I have, and you think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget. And one of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left. In fact, he's still gone to the hardware store and I, I think I would have not done before. I make a list of what he was going for because he might forget. And then he has to explain to the people there. Although he has had so much therapy that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants. And it's very rare. There's a failure there. He draws a lot of little tiny pictures, but I've learned that to be sure. I, it's hard to remember to verify all the time. And he doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend and maybe he thinks he comprehends. So, how do you discern between those two things? That's quite difficult? Him? Does he think he understands perfectly or does he not understand? And doesn't, not really wanna say he doesn't understand? So, things like that make it very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him. You can take it to the bank. He totally understands if he sees it written. Uh I know not to ask him. Um numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. Um I did find out in the last week that he can repeat thanks to you and that is something he has never been able to repeat, not even one word. And now he seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he can tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask him to repeat a word. Um It's very difficult socially. It's such such an isolating disability. That's I I've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man because women are more other women are more caring, more empathetic, less frightened. And I think men are not in general. So there is this learning curve for men. They, they, they have this discomfort and so it's just easier to avoid. Um And I always feel badly for him because he is left out a lot. And I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter to explain to people what's wrong and please don't interrupt and, um, please turn the TV off or please turn the radio off or, um, you don't have to shout, although I don't find that so much. Um, but some people do, um, people are not comfortable with disabilities, they don't understand and even if they understand them at first they feel awkward because they don't know if it's sensitive and it's gonna upset you to talk about it and always tell me we've been doing this for 25 years. We're not gonna get upset about it. Um, it's just what it is.

Even animals cheered up when they were around her because she just let off this gift of light and love and and the sisters were very jealous and the stepmother was very jealous also. So they mistreated Cinderella and had her do terrible things uh that none of them wanted to do. So, Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in and the castle there was a a family obviously who lived there and the prince um was looking to find love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all everyone in the entire village come to this ball. So Cinderella's stepsisters um got all of their, you know, their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things. And Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball and since her stepmother and her stepsisters didn't help her, all of the animals did. So the, the animals who loved Cinderella because she was so good, put together a beautiful gown for her. And just as Cinderella thought she was gonna get out of the house. Um her stepsisters and her stepmother ruined her gown and she was very, very sad and the stepsisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with, you know, ripped up dress and, and nothing to do. So this fairy godmother showed up and said, Cinderella, you are such a nice person. You're such a good person and you have so much love to give and you so much light. I really want you to go to the ball. So I'm going to create a horse and carriage and a new outfit for you and it's gonna be so lovely, but it ends at midnight. So you have to make sure you come home before then. So Cinderella goes to the ball and her stepsisters were not pleased because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in because she was just so beautiful. And the prince of course, noticed her beauty and grace and again, this kind of calm light, soothing to people that she let off and he danced with her and just then she realized it was almost midnight. And so she ran out, she lost one of her shoes and she didn't even make it home when everything went back in the way that it was. And then one of the people who worked at the castle came around with the slipper that was found at the ball and tried it on every woman in town and it fits the rella and Cinderella found her prince or the prince found her by her dainty little glass shoe and they lived happily ever after."}, {"segment_name": "MSUC09b_22394_259084.wav", "aws_transcription": "Yeah. Well, the big one is my cancer. Uh, Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed about three months after I retired in 2011. I had symptoms before then, but didn't connect the dots. I had night sweats. I was tired and you just didn't think much of it. But then I noticed that I was losing weight and that's what caused me to seek a doctor. So I went to, I hadn't been to a doctor in years. Uh, so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now both our physician for both of us. She did a, an office exam and I was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram because she palpated and she felt something, uh, the lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram and that was positive enough for me to have a cat scan and a pet scan that led to the need for a biopsy. So at that by then, it was becoming clear that there was something wrong. Uh, the decision was gonna be, is it, it, it was lymphoma? But is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or non Hodgkins lymphoma? So I went to mountainside hospital in Mont Clair for a needle biopsy. But that wasn't enough uh that not enough tissue was obtained. So I had to go into the city into New York to Sloan for uh a more complete biopsy and that clinched it. It was Hodgkin's lymphoma, which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two. Hodgkins is much more treatable, higher success rate. So I started chemo and uh after the first session, I developed a rash and we weren't quite sure what was going on. One of the nurses that the oncologist wasn't sure and he was going to proceed with the treatment for the for the Hodgkins. But one of his nurses said this is an allergic reaction and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to alopurinol. I think I mentioned this last time, um which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout, but it has a protective effect for kidney function that landed me in the hospital with, with what's called Steven Johnson syndrome, which is treated like a burn. People at Stevens Johnson are often sent to burn units. My mouth was inflamed but it was just off. I couldn't drink water. It, it burned that of course suspended chemo. Uh we worked through the Stevens Johnson. I was looking forward to chemo. It was, it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be a vacation uh so, um and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather, but still I, I couldn't take solid food for, for two weeks or so, nor water. It was, it was the only thing that really worked was, was um uh iced tea. Um So I got through this Steven Johnson, went back to chemo and had chemo for several months.

Or usually I can much faster thinking back. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently, it was February 1978. It had been snowing all day. And in fact, that was the year when we had the blizzard of 1978 and we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon on this day in February, when my husband came home from work where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church, he said, Carla, come in the house. I want to tell you something. I want to ask you something. So I said, ok, so I followed him in taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He said, sit down for a minute. So I said, ok, I'm sitting, what do you have to ask me, how would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years? Kenya? I said, where's Kenya? He said it's on the equator where it's hot? No snow? I said, count me in, let's go. And so we did, uh, he had received an invitation to come and work with the National Christian Council of Kenya in a family life education program where he would be responsible for setting up a counseling center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in community health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it. And so four months later, we had sold our house, our car, most of our household possessions, with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend and our family of four, my husband, Ted, our two daughters, Michelle aged nine and Cindy aged five. And I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron Pennsylvania because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran in background and he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite mission program. Well, who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to a 10 day orientation period in the heart of Mennonite country in Akron, Pennsylvania where we spent 10 marvelous days getting to know um the Mennonites and also a group of other people who were about to embark on Mennonite sponsored mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three year period of high adventure for our family. One of the best times in our lives whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see from with a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, in the beginning, a little boy is outside playing with a soccer ball. He gives it a good kick.

So I was describing a little bit of what I was experiencing that day. And she said, Sally, you're having a baby today. And I said, no, I'm not because I didn't even, you know, there wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and what not. And so I kept saying, no, no, no, no, no. And she said, yeah, you're having a baby today. So, uh and that was really like late afternoon when that happened. And by about six o'clock, I think it was ii I started feeling more stuff happening and still, I didn't think we needed. There was any big deal, I, you know, it wasn't like enough and I think we must have arrived at the hospital by um by, by 7 30. I it was like, ok, yeah, this is real, it's, it's time. And so on the way to the hospital and my husband, I think this was my first child and getting kind of confused anyway, he's of course, you know, like, oh my gosh, you're gonna make me do that right now. And, and, uh, and so, of course, I was having contractions in the car and one point he was speeding like he was speeding and, and he barely would stop by the lights. And we all continue to laugh because my words were, I, I yelled at him to slow down and said, it's not about you. It's about me. And I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous but he and I just always laugh at that still to this day. It's not about you. It's about me, which was a stupid thing to say. But you know who's rational at that point. So we got to the hospital and uh she was born uh at about 11 35. I, boy, what kind of a mom am I? I don't even remember somewhere after 11 30 because I remember when she was born then that, um I was thinking about what date it was, it was the 14th and that somebody had hoped that if I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday and I had, you know, missed that window. Um But anyway, uh so it, you know, of course, that's incredible when you hold your first child in your arms for the first time. But I was exceedingly grateful that it was a relatively quick delivery and, and, you know, that's not to say it didn't hurt Ashley. That's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a, um, you know, a great experience all in all. And, and then we had our first baby. Wow. Now she's 22. Is that enough? Also tell a story, take a second to look at them. And then when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with a beginning, a middle and an end. Once there was a boy named Sam. Sam loved to play soccer but it was during the Coronavirus pandemic. So Sam could not play soccer with his soccer team. The best he could do was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around. He kicked and kicked and kicked and eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house. His neighbor was an adult man named uh Ferdinand."}, {"segment_name": "richardson196_32523_269170.wav", "aws_transcription": "Uh, so Jonathan was playing with his soccer ball outside. It was a pretty sunny day. Um, and, you know, sometimes when you're practicing some soccer, uh, things get a little out of hand and so his soccer ball went through the glass window of his neighbor, uh Mr Willis who is in the middle of watching TV, just relaxing and the soccer ball lands right in his lap. So there was no escaping bat. Um, so then he picks up the ball and looks outside and sees Jonathan who is then running away because he realizes that he made a terrible mistake against Mr Willis, ok? At split. So we're gonna do the same thing with another one. So take a look at these pictures and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Uh, so James is on his way to school, he walks to school every day and his mom said, you know, James, you should take your umbrella. I really think you should take your umbrella. It's supposed to rain today and James was like, no mom, it's sunny right now. It's gonna be fine. I'm not gonna take the umbrella. He probably wouldn't stay with that vernacular because he's like seven. But he goes outside, it starts raining and he's like, oh, no. Oh, no, I don't have my umbrella. My mom was so right. So he runs home in the rain and gets all wet, all his books, get wet in his backpack, he gets home and his mom is less than pleased with him, um, because he's dragged his, his wet shoes himself into the house and she's looking very sternly at him. And so now James is always sure to pack his umbrella because he does not want to get in trouble again. Ok, good. Ok, we're gonna do the same thing with this one. This is a little bit different. It's kind of a scene. So take a look at the entire picture and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So a man Philip was walking on the street and, uh, he gets a little startled by this, this growling dog that had jumped the fence, um, of, you know, um, a house in the neighborhood, this dog had jumped the fence and was very ferocious. So the man got scared and switched his pace from walking to a full on sprint and in the, in the way of how fighter flight works, he climbs up a tree and gets in a branch. So is this so to get away from the dog? And, um, meanwhile, this cat was also startled. This is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood. And the cat also got startled because of this dog. And so it climbed up the tree. Now, this little girl is riding her, her tricycle and sees this cute little cat. And so she's trying to coax it down from the tree. Uh Meanwhile another, another fellow walker on the street saw um what the whole scene was going of what was happening and how there's not only this cat stuck in the tree but also a man stuck in the tree um who was afraid to get down. So the fire, the fire department gets called and the fire department comes with their ladders to rescue the man and the cat."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL62-2_1104587_1341190.wav", "aws_transcription": "All right. It starts with the stepmother and the two daughters. And there's a gentleman in the next picture with a little girl who is Cinderella who is singing and all pleasant and they obviously aren't. Um I presume this is going to be her father, but he never shows up again. Um They, this sisters and mother treat Cinderella like she's a servant and they're very unkind to her and she may as a result, she makes friends with the animals and down the road. The stepmother gets a letter inviting everyone to a ball at the castle because the prince's father, the king thinks it's time for him to find a wife and everyone is invited and the girls are all very excited and Cinderella thinks she's included. So she, there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk. And the only thing I can think that is, is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instructions. So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom and mix with the help of the mice. They make a dress and she gets ready the night of the fall to go and is told that this was not for her. She's not allowed to go. And I, I recall they rip her dress to shreds and they go on to the ball and she kind of goes back to her lofty place. Uh The next thing we see is we've got the mice and the animals around being empathetic. And then her favorite Godfather appears and the fairy godmother whips her up a beautiful white gown and a pumpkin carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, but something scared the horses and that was before this. So anyway, the pumpkin carriage is all good. She gets in the carriage. The fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight before it all goes away. So she goes to the ball, the stepmother and sisters are and hard to see her and um not happy at all. And the prince is enchanted and they spend the evening dancing and all of a sudden she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight and she takes off running and going down the stairs. She loses one of the glass slippers provided by the, the very godmother. And the prince finds that and she gets home and um she look, she's sitting with the animals looking at the glass slipper with good memories. So now the prince still has a glass slipper and he sends everyone out looking for the the girl with the glass other glass slipper and when they hear about this, the stepmother and stepsisters, um, they realize it was her and they don't want him to know. So they lock her in her room. However, the little animals, the mice is special. I bring a key to get her to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper. And that is what happens. She goes downstairs tries on the glass slipper. The prince realizes he's found his bride and that's not the end of the stepmother and stepsisters. And the last we see is they're, they're getting married living happily ever after. Beautifully. I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Ok. Well, the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made with white bread, totally unhealthy, but it's so good. Um, so you need two pieces of white bread and a knife and a plate and you need peanut butter.

He apparently traveled a lot and so he was gone. Um The uh so anyway, the, the uh woman introduced herself to Cinderella telling her that she was her fairy godmother and she was there to grant her wishes. Well, Cinderella was taken aback quite, quite thrilled at this whole possibility. And so the fairy godmother said you will go to the ball. And she, I think the very first thing she did was to, to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella and her beautiful hairdo and lovely uh tiara type thing to put in her hair and beautiful slippers to put on her feet, which were very unusually made out of glass. But Cinderella said, how can I get to the ball? The carriage is gone. I can't walk, uh especially not in glass slippers. And so the fairy godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin, created uh a coachman and uh other servants out of the mice and I think made the rats into horses. So anyway, there they were all set ready to go to the ball. So she left Cinderella left in her all her finery and went to the ball, walked in and the whole place came to a hush. Everybody's looking at her and thinking, who is that beautiful young woman? And of course, guess who was the most impressed was the prince. So he immediately asked her to dance and after they had one dance, he was really not interested in anybody else. So they had a lovely time suddenly though Cinderella remembered the most important thing that the fairy godmother had told her, which was at the stroke of midnight, she had to leave the ball because if by the end of 12 bell strikes, she was still there. Everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were brill. So she uh she was remembering that and thinking, oh, I really have to be careful, but she was so carried away by this lovely time that she was having with the prince and he was so uh falling so much in love with her that time went on really fast and all of a sudden bang, she started to hear, she heard the first uh stroke of midnight.

And the worst blood cramps it was bad. But anyway, I think little Red Riding Hood is doing the same thing and she's gotten a reputation for wearing it. So she's called Little Red Riding Hood and one day. I mean, she lives with her mom. I don't know where the dad is. He probably ran out on her, but probably because she wears that red hood all the time. I think that's the source of all her problems. Um, so she lives with her mom and one day the woodcutter comes to her little cottage in the woods. Maybe the woodcutters her dad. And he's just stopping by every so often to keep tabs on her. But he doesn't actually want any fatherly responsibilities. But he comes up and he says, hey, snow, white, snow, white, red riding hood and your mother, I was just out at your grandma's cottage and she is kind of sick like you should probably go see her before she dies. That's not true. You didn't say that. Maybe it was implied. But then again, why would you leave your grandmother in a cottage all on her own? That doesn't make sense. She's probably ok.

Cinderella received a delivery, it was sealed and the delivery went to the stepmother, stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody, read it out to the sisters and to Cinder Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited, but as it turned out, she was not. So the stepmother denied her the and I would imagine stepmother and daughters, we're off to the ball. They were invited to a ball and the prince was having a ball was left back home dreaming that she could go to the mall. In fact, she tried on and looked at her dress that she would like to wear. She were going to the mall. She mentioned the dress and then she looked at pictures of the dress. She was friends with a small creatures. They decided to make a dress for her. So they sewed and they spun and they weaved and, you know, applicate the bows on the dress. She didn't know this was happening. Glance at the castle and probably heard the music. The birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special surprise for her. She was so delighted with the dress. Meanwhile, the stepmother and the two sisters were uh pacing off to the ball and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed. Let's see. Dressed in shreds.

This is the proper way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Thank you guys. You're hilarious. Ok. So now I would like for you to tell me as much the story of Snow White as you can. You can use any details, you know about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at. Ok. So once upon a time there was a princess and her name was Snow White and her name was no white because her skin was as white as snow. Her hair was as dark as like a Ravens feathers or something like that. And her lips were as red as a rose. She was beautiful. I don't know how she has a stepmother assuming she had parents and then her mother died and then her father died and then he er sorry mother died, father remarried, then father died because you would hope that he would step in. So snow white was reduced to doing chores, not like other premises of fairy tales. And while she did this, she was contented with her dream with prince, didn't get out of the castle very much. And there's this really famous scene where she's singing over wishing well. And her voice is echoing back to her. So she says, I wishing and then it echoes back. And she's basically saying that one day she'll get saved from this by a prince. So the stepmother was not very happy that snow white was as beautiful as she was because she was used to being the fairest, not land. And she has a mirror that when she asks mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them? All the mirror responds that she is the fairest of them mall usually in run. Um, that there are none as beautiful as she. And one day when the queen who has very low self esteem asked the mirror who the Pharis in the land was? The mirror responded that it's pretty fickle mirror. That's not why it was. In fact the fairest of them all. So having not to be vested by snow whites good looks. Their stepmother said orders a Huntsman to take snow white into the forest and to kill her pretty messed up and you could have just maimed her right like acid or something. But so the hunter takes snow white into the forest. And in the version that I know snow white figures out that she's in trouble and she runs away from the hunter when he tries to kill her and that's how she gets away. Um And while she's running into the forest, she gets lost. Um, in the wood and, um, she comes upon a, a house in a clearing. Um, she gets to the house and she realizes that everything is small and that it's filthy. So, doing what she does best chores. She gets right to work with her animal friends.

So they, they get together. The mother is cool. The stepmother is cool to the, to the, to the step girl of the daughter who in this case, for lack of names will give her the name Cinderella. And she, she's very cruel to her and she, she gives her all the menial tasks and all the other work and she treats her daughters like queens. And then I, you know, I work in the house and uh and Cinderella is a very kind, gentle person. Uh and she, she's gets touched with the, with the, with the animals she contact with them and they very, they communicate very well. And she has uh vision and she can see though, I don't want the, the castle that they live not far from the castle and she can see the castle and so forth. And one day that an invitation comes for the family to go to this ball at the castle. And they're all excited including Cinderella.

And while they're at the, everybody leaves the ball while they're at the ball, she's touched by the very godmother.

And my son had to go into a special care nursery. So he wasn't in my room with me and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the special care nursery so that I could nurse him.

So I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in, in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So I have just always been really interested in ways to improve. And of course, for the last four years is when I've been at the Aphasia lab. So we've focused on aphasia and being able to number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication. But also I teach the adult language disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication, uh supported conversation with family members and just trying to improve in general people's ability to communicate no matter what their verbal communication is like and no matter what their cognitive skills are, either, I have done research both with people with stroke, but also with brain injuries.

Oh, yes, I remember this one last time because um the only examples I could really think of were my mother and mother-in-law and father-in-law because they both had uh health problems which affected their ability to communicate. The one I really didn't talk about was my mother for the last 02 or three years that she was alive was getting, the focus was getting um dementia, mild dementia, certainly not Alzheimer's. But uh her short term memory was really starting to go. So I call her on the phone that want to about once a month or sometimes more. If there was uh anniversaries and birthdays and things like that or if we were planning to come to Philadelphia and this started while she was still living at the house. I grew up in, in Elkins Park in the north side of Philadelphia area. And, uh, I would talk to her on the phone and say me and are coming in May. We're going to New Jersey and then we'll be in Philadelphia and, oh, you know how long you're gonna be here visiting my brother and we'll visit here for a few days and, and, uh, then we might go see my cousin and, oh, that's nice. Um, when are you coming? Well, like around Memorial Day and the week after Memorial Day and how long are you gonna be here? Like, oh, you're gonna visit anybody else, then I'm gonna go see my brother and see my cousin and we would just do this exact same conversation. Yeah, a couple, two or three times. And then we talk about Jean's doing belly dance and like, oh, I didn't know that and like, how often did she do it? And then like we talk about that, we talk about the house and, and she said, well, when am I, am I gonna ever see you again? When are you gonna come visit? And like, uh, in about two weeks, Memorial Day and it would be really frustrating. But after I got kind of used to it, I had just try not to lose my patience and just, just tell the story again, third time or fourth time and, and it was just really short term because she can remember other things. Let me go back to going back to the 19 twenties. And I see when she was born had a very good memory for a lot of things, especially for people in the family that were unpleasant to her 50 years ago. She remembered, but she remembers vacations and different places."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto13a_307578_543431.wav", "aws_transcription": "Recover. Oh, well, I had to, of course, drink plenty of fluids, uh be sure that to take my medicine too. When I came home, I had to do that. Uh But the main thing was to, you know, drink a lot of fluids and rest and, and uh you know, uh just keep myself in good shape and I get run down. Um I suppose right now, my, I don't usually have a difficult time communicating, but I do at this particular time, have a difficult time communicating with the manager of, of the uh uh townhouse complex where I live. And I think it's because when I make suggestions to, to improve the conditions there, she perceives it as being, as me being critical. And like if I say, well, can we trim this tree or can this tree be trimmed or something like that? Then she, she takes that as being critical. So I find her, I find communicating with her as a challenge. And at this point, I'm just about to the point where I don't even want to communicate with her because it's not worth my time or effort. And besides that, it doesn't really make all that much difference anyway. Um, so that, that's probably my most, you know, I would say, oh, there's been times in the past with students who they don't understand what you have said and, and, you know, you, but you just have to go over it again with them. And I, but I find that's just a normal part of teaching. Yeah. Well, at my age, of course, there's always, there are sad, one has experienced sad events, um, death of loved ones, et cetera. But I guess I would choose to focus on the things that are the most positive and that would have to be, of course, the birth of my three Children. Um, those were very positive events. Um, think back on that you were very, very happy that they were born and they were healthy and, and, uh, uh, you know, very grateful. I, I wanted boys all three times. I got boys all three times. Although now I, I could see the advantage of having a daughter but I do have a daughter in law. So, um, that's, uh, you know, that's a problem. The other very happy times in my life have been the times where I had traveled and met people. I've been all over the world and, and I, I do a lot of mission work. So, um, you know, communicating with those folks and, and being able to share something with them and to see, go back and see the progress they have made. And, um, that, that's a, a very gratifying, uh, you know, position to be in story of a little boy playing ball or kick ball, I guess. Or he's kicking a ball and he, um, kicks it through a window, breaks a window, the ball falls in the, in a, in a man's lap as he's sitting in a chair and knocks over a lamp, breaks the window, knocks over the lamp and, um, the man then picks up the ball and goes to the window looks out."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL28-1_845825_1081665.wav", "aws_transcription": "And then they decided to hold a ball that they would invite all the kingdom, all the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to. So a notice was sent out and the stepmother read the notice and the girls were very excited, Cinderella hadn't been to a ball. So she was very, very excited. And then the stepmother maid had beautiful dresses made for her two daughters, but not Cinderella and Cinderella with the help of her forest friends or her animal friends. Um, and uh very godmother made a uh a beautiful dress. Um Well, I guess the fairy godmother didn't help that yet. Well, Cinderella made a dress and um then she was planning to go and the stepmother said, no, you're not going anywhere, you're going to stay home and cleaned the house, we're going to the ball and Cinderella was sad. Then she um had her dress kind of tore up and by the stepmothers by the stepsisters and then everyone left for the bollocks up for Cinderella and then she made a wish and the fairy godmother was there and she granted her wish to, to that she would get to go to the ball. So using the forest animals, they created a everything she needed a beautiful gown. They turned the pumpkin into a coach, they changed the mice into horses and um everybody participated. But the thing is they told her she had to be home by midnight when the clock struck midnight because the magic would wear off. So Cinderella went to the ball and she came in and everybody was um since it was a uh kind of a masquerade kind of ball too. Not everybody knew who everybody was, depends on which version you watch. Um So she went in and everyone danced with the prince and the prince fell in love with Cinderella um and wanted to dance the night away with her, but she noticed it was getting close to midnight. So she was leaving the ball and he was chasing her and then when she was going, um when she was on the steps, she had lost one of her class slippers which miraculously didn't change back into what it was prior. Um And she got to the cart just as that, she got to the carriage just as it was striking midnight. And then on our way home, it changed back into forest animals and vegetables or pumpkins. But she got home and Cinderella's sisters got home stepsisters got home with her mom and they couldn't believe who this girl was, who was at the ball that they weren't treated like they were the first of them. All the prince wanted to find out who it was, that was at the ball since no one knew who Cinderella was. And he decided to go on a search for the love of his life um by having all the girls in the kingdom try on the glass slipper and he searched and he searched and then he finally stopped at the, the house where Cinderella and her family lived and they tried the slippers on the sisters who each of the girls tried to shove their feet in them, but they didn't fit and then they whined and then they weren't gonna try anybody else because they didn't know about Cinderella."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL62-1_257892_493724.wav", "aws_transcription": "And this is, it's hard on the, um, the person without aphasia because even though you've learned to talk in more descriptive words, even subconsciously, there are always times that you don't and you assume they understand, they never give you a clue that they don't. And so you end up with the short end of the straw. All right. Now, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from any time. Um, boy, it's hard to think of things. Um, I have one thing I could say, but I'd be in tears so I can't go there. Um, probably the most important thing that's happened in our lives was the day he had the stroke. Um, and how much detail do you want as much as you wanna give? Ok. Um, at the time he had a stroke. He was working as an executive at a gasoline company and actually, that's not true. He had a different position by then, but he was doing an audit of a gasoline station and we owned some gift shops that I managed and I had come home early because my daughter was ill and school had said come pick her up, I brought her home, fed her, I just sent her up to bed. She didn't feel well. And my phone rang and it was one of the people who worked for my husband, he was a young man in his thirties. And he, he says that and, um, uh, you know, I'm, I'm here with your husband and I know he hasn't been feeling well. But, um, this goes on and on. He's, but he's on the floor. We're in this, the back of this gas station convenience store and he's on the floor and his eyes are open, but he keeps wanting to close them and he can't seem to talk. And I realized right away he had, had a stroke just because I'm a nurse. And I said to him, is he breathing? And he said yes. And I said, do you know how to do CPR? And he said, no, um, I said, well, here's what I want you to do. I want you to first call 911 and tell them to get there. And when they do call me back, I said, and in the meantime, I want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do CPR in case we need it. So he did that and he came back and he says, well, one guy says, he saw it done on TV. I'm going, well, it's not real helpful, but ok, he says, but I can hear the sirens right now and I said, that's good. That's good. I said, ok, I'll stay on with you when, when they get there, let me talk to them and I'll tell them what's happening and what he's taken and what his history is. So, anyway, long story short, they took him to a hospital on the south side of Indianapolis. I jumped into my car with an 11 year old and a, this is so old. I had a bag phone. Ok, this is 1996 even. That was not something everyone had. I had it because of the business that I needed to be able to be reached because we had these two stores.

And the fairy godmother says, oh, I see that you still have these rags on your feet. I'm going to turn them into beautiful glass slippers. This is an important plot device for later. So I'm pointing it up now. So Cinderella is all set to go to this ball and she's practically unrecognizable, not really, but just to her, you know, everybody because nobody actually cares about her in her life. So she's unrecognizable at this point because she's happy and beautiful. And the very godmother says, Cinderella, you gotta get out of this ball before midnight because at that point, everything's gonna go to crap. So you don't want that to happen in front of the prince. You want to make a good impression on this guy. And so Cinderella says, yeah, whatever, bye and goes off to the ball drawn by her mice and dog in a pumpkin and they get to the ball and she enters the grand entrance area four year, four year. I don't know. Um she enters and all of a sudden the prince is struck by her radiant beauty and they dance d all night and it's all very romantic and I don't think the prince asks her name, which is sketchy because you should generally not dance the night away with a guy. You don't know the name of just a general rule. But I'm willing to let her have a pass on this because she was raised by humans. So she's having a great time dancing with the prince. Nobody recognizes her and all of a sudden the clock start striking at midnight. And so she books it. She is trying to get to her carriage and get home before everything goes to crap because her grandmother actually had some fair points there. And so she's running down the steps and heels, which is very, very hard, like I, I sympathize and she loses a heel, which is fair and she thinks that going back for it, that doesn't really have time because she still needs to like it to the carriage. And so she just leaves the heel on the steps, the glass slipper and she gets to the carriage and they start driving off into the distance and they make it some distance before the spell ends. And she's left on the side of the road in rags surrounded by mice and dogs and sitting on a dead pumpkin. And eventually she gets over her sadness, she makes her way home. So that she can wallow in misery under a roof. And then she's, you know, just going about her business trying to not make it seem like she actually went to this ball because her step family wouldn't really be about that. And all of a sudden the, the kings, what did I say? He was advisor. Let's call him an advisor. He's good with the Monocle. He comes to the door and he says we have this shoe that the prince who marry whoever's foot, the shoe fits. And the evil stepmother thinks to herself, this is swell. Things didn't go over so well last night. But if I can shove one of my step, one of my daughter's feet into this shoe, we're home free. So she sneaks upstairs. This may have happened earlier. I don't remember, but she sneaks upstairs. She walks Cinderella in her room where she's following in misery and, and then goes back downstairs and they're all trying to put the shoe on their feet, but it's not working.

And then the prince said, I want to keep dancing with you all night, which caused Cinderella to look at the clock. Now, the very godmother had told her you can have, you can be at the ball until midnight. But at the stroke of 12, you will again become Cinderella in your tattered clothes and the pump and the coach will once once again become a pumpkin and everything will go back to how it was.

The son was not yet married and didn't, haven't really found anybody that he was interested in marrying.

And, uh, the wolf, the big bad wolf runs into Little Red Riding. The dad who scares him and they all live happily ever after. Ok. So we're gonna do something a little different. Now, um, I need you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As if I've never made one before. You take two slices of bread and you would lay them out, um, on the table and get a butter knife and get out the peanut butter and the jelly. And you would scoop out some peanut butter and slather it over one slice of bread and then skip out the jelly and put it on the other slice of bread and spread it all over."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL14-2_341393_576892.wav", "aws_transcription": "About this. Um OK, so in 1984 I applied and received a scholarship to do my master's degree at De Paul University in Greencastle Indiana. And during the first week of having arrived, even before classes started, we were just orientation, et cetera, et cetera. I found out that the Panna Games were going to come to Indianapolis in 1987. So I immediately applied for a job with the Pan M Games that took the whole duration of my master's degree to materialize. But eventually in 86 I was um I was appointed Vice president of International Relations with the Pan Games. And as such, I traveled extensively with the president of the Phantom Games organizing committee, including a trip to Cuba to meet with Fidel Castro and uh convince him or rather offer conditions that would satisfy him for Cuba to participate in the Panama Games in Indianapolis of 87th. That's the 10th Pan American Games. So essentially, we offered um that the athletes would not have to receive a visa. Anybody who got on the plane came to the games, that the plane would fly directly from Havana to Indianapolis that they would get a preferential area of the Pan American village to house their athletes. And finally, that the United States would lend every support it could to the organization of the 1991 games in Havana. So those were the four conditions that the Cubans requested. We said yes to everything. Of course, the last one was whatever is in our power to do because we are not the Pan American sports organization who is ultimately the one that decides where the next games are gonna be played. Um And so, so Cuba uh agreed to participate and I was the one person that got the call from the Olympic committee in Cuba from the Cuban Olympic Committee confirming that they were going to participate. And that was very thrilling because for a few minutes, I was the only one that knew that Cuba was going to participate in the Pan End Games, which was a, a very uh sought after objective. It was whatever everybody wanted. And I was the only person in the organization that knew about it because I was uh acting as an interpreter between the Cubans and the organizing committee in India. So that was a real thrill. Um And the Cubans participated and the Panna Games went to Cuba in 1991 I was not a part of that. But then in 95 I met the Cubans again because they came as consultants to my um to my participation in the Pan American Games in Argentina."}, {"segment_name": "wright10a_1228073_1463543.wav", "aws_transcription": "And so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water.

Carl and the baby were both very hungry. So they wandered into the kitchen, they got into the refrigerator. What did they find? Bread and butter? Carl got a package of whole wheat bread and he ripped it open, ate all the bread. Meanwhile, the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty, buttery taste. They found grapes and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth. They made chocolate milk with syrup. What a mess you can imagine.

Um I uh the person that I had the most contact with like this, that was my mother and she um started to have memory issues back in 1995 where she would repeat her what she had just said and without any awareness that she was repeating herself. And of course, at first that's, you don't really know how to deal with that. And I had a, I'm not sure, honestly, I don't, I'm not sure that I did this, but I think that I would say, yeah, mom, we decided on that, you know, a little while ago. And so we're gonna do this. And so I would tell her what we had decided when she brought that first time. Um So that gradually got worse. Uh It was diagnosed by her doctor's vascular dementia. So she was having little tiny strokes that were knocking out connections in her brain. And um the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright, real intelligent and she would tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something she would read in the paper that somebody had died and then talk about it and then later do the same thing and then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before. Um, and I didn't, and so I didn't know it. She would, she would make up reasons, logical, logical reasons why she hadn't known something. Um, she also got really good at asking questions instead of ask, you know, making, making, asking other people to talk, instead of having them ask her questions because she knew she didn't, wasn't able to answer questions. Um I, um so I think I'm not sure, but I think that this was some reading that I had done, which said that with a person with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely no point in trying to help them to remember or, or, or make them, or for heaven's sake, make them feel bad about not remembering things. Um Because of course, where there's a period of time in there when you, when you realize when my mother was realizing that she was losing memory and, and it was horrible for her. She felt awful and, and of course, after a while, it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore and that's really better. Uh at, at least it didn't hurt her so much. And um I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what experience these experiencing things mean when you means when you can't remember them, like we would go to um plays and musicals and, and concerts and this was when she was living with my aunt and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies really, but, but musical things, concerts and, and musicals, musical theater mom would have no memory whatsoever of that the next day. But she loved it while it was happening. Just was delighted. She was always musical and these, this kind of stuff just pleased her in the end. And so I had, it was really interesting to think about what she, what it means. What that means, is it valuable? How valuable is it when you don't remember it? And I decided ultimately, it was really valuable."}, {"segment_name": "wright80a_629080_864525.wav", "aws_transcription": "God.

I don't remember where Heidi went. The dog's name was Heidi and she was there. But I went, I got up the stairs because it was, uh, the yard stairs, went into the backyard, going down the stairs. So I had to go up the stairs that my husband built this porch. It was a patio porch and with stairs and we would sit out there and have our barbecue and that.

So I got upstairs and went on to the couch and I laid down and I, it was, wasn't hurting. And when my middle son came home from school, he said, what happened to you? And I said, well, I think I broke my foot because I heard this snappy noise while I was playing with Heidi. He said, well, you have better get to the hospital. And I said, oh, no, I'm ok. I don't have to go to the hospital. He said, oh, yes, you do. He must have been in about fifth grade. So you have to go to the hospital. No, I, no, I don't. And he said, well, I'm going next door to talk to Steve. His wife is a nurse. So he went and he told Steve and Steve told his wife the nurse what happened since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do. He ran off to find out some other advice. So the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor. So then I called my husband and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious. The nurse would know what to do, not me or not my son, but obviously he did know what to do. So when I went to the doctor, he, they x-rayed my foot.

Cinderella is a very, a good hearted, good natured young woman. She takes it all in stride tries to do her best her new place within this family.

And the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at the ball at the strike of 12, you must be out of there because at that time, your coach will turn into a pumpkin. Cinderella went to the ball. The prince could not take his eyes off her because she was so good and so beautiful and she had a wonderful time. But all of a sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike 12. She knew she had to get the heck out of there really fast in so doing, she dropped one of her slippers but it didn't make any difference.

But her, in her distress, her fairy godmother showed up and uh granted her the opportunity to have a gorgeous gown and uh shoes and, and carriage and horse, which she took all of the, the animals, the mice and the cats and what have you that uh were favorites of Cinderella and converted those into a fancy carriage and horses with a carriage master and so forth that took Cinderella to the vault. And so she had the opportunity to go, but the only condition was that she had to be back home by midnight because everything would go back to normal. The whole facade would be revealed after midnight. So she met, she had a great time. She got the opportunity to meet the prince. They enjoyed some time together and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company. During the course of the ball. Of course, the stepmother wanted her daughters to have that opportunity and was rather jealous over this girl that she didn't recognize as Cinderella at the time, but tried to force her way to having the prince recognize her daughters and everything. And so then when midnight rolled around, Cinderella had been having such a good time that she let the time get away from her. And at the very last second, she had to race from the, from the castle um to get in her carriage and, and make it home and just barely made it."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL18-1_298140_533423.wav", "aws_transcription": "So I had my screening after all of my treatments and I'm still in remission and it's 2020. So at least it's been that many years. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. Um So that's great. Um Yeah. Um So because now what I'd like for you to do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situation and I'm gonna meet myself. Ok? Um Well, I'm not, I'll just say a person or this person or um the difficulty in trying to communicate with this person is that this person uh lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time um conveying that in words and many times it turns into emotion or feeling and um which, you know, can be anger, frustration, um any of those sorts of things, but that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated. But on the outside, we have no idea because those words never came out. Um And so what I try to do is ask questions and see what kind of answers I can get to put together what the problem is. Um, because it's much easier, in my opinion, to deal with those sorts of things as they come up rather than waiting until someone, um, is like a powder keg and just blows up. Um, however, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate because then their problem is why are you asking all these questions? Um, and then it's sort of like, um then you back off and you give the time to, to calm down. Um But then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because say in this, in this situation, it's a work environment and you, I need answers and I need clear communication. Um So another thing that I have tried to do is I see uh one individual in our office who can communicate with this person. And so I take notes on how that person works with the other person. And I also use that person occasionally to help me understand and get information as well. Um I won't say that it's uh successful all of the time, but it is uh successful enough for me to get by. So asking questions, backing off as needed, feeling out the situation and finding uh an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage thinking back. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand what you already talked about might also fit this. But if you could choose something different to talk about in this case, that would be great. Um And it can be happy or sad. It can be from any point in your life, child, from child to now. So do you need a few moments to think about what you would? Oh, you know. Ok. Yeah, then I will meet myself and you may please tell me your story. Sure. Uh It's one story but it has two parts.

Her mother died and her father married a new wife who had two Children of her own. They came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father, her new stepmother and her and the stepmother's two daughters, Cinderella's stepsisters now didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful and they were mean to Cinderella and the mother, the stepmother decided that Cinderella would be, the maid would be like a maid and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work. She made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning. And she had to serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters. One day an invitation came, the prince was having a ball and all the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball stepmother and stepsisters were so excited and they started planning right away for the ball. Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs. And the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of of very long, difficult dirty jobs knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in order to go to the ball. Cinderella was so sad. She went in her room and cried and her animal friends gathered around her. She was friends with all the animals because she was so nice and the animals loved her. The animals helped her do her chores and they all worked very hard and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball. When it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked and the beautiful dress, they just went crazy with rage and they tore the dress off of her, the pins out of her hair and they pushed her down told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball crying. She went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her. Then fairy godmother appeared and took pity on Cinderella with a wave of her wand. The fairy godmother produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen. Cinderella looked beautiful. The stepmother or the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball, but she had to be back home by midnight because at midnight, her clothes and her carriage and everything were going to disappear and go back to normal. So she took some mice and with the wave of her wand, she turned them into horses, turned the pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. Cinderella climbed in her beautiful gown and went to the ball. Everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom and the prince fell in love immediately, they danced all night."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL40-2_26900_262107.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. Um See, other than uh being having babies. Uh and um don any kidney, I did have um numerous colds and ear infections when I was young. So about five, when I was about five years old, it was determined that they were gonna take my tonsils out. So they kind of told me what was going to be about and that I would have a scratchy throat and I can't remember everything because I was five years old. Um But I do remember waking up and my mom was there and she was so comforting to me very um difficult to swallow. So my, my throat was swollen and it hurt and this is a lot for a five year old. And my parents brought my um Ken and Barbie Doll and Little Doll House. I can play with that while I was in the hospital bed and I remember them bringing me Lime Sherbert and it was so good on my throat. Um I believe I was in the hospital about two days and the recovery was, was fairly easy. It took me a while, maybe about four or five days before I could actually eat something. That was true and solid, but that really did help with the colds because I didn't hardly have any colds at all. So, there you go. Easy peasy before we, I, I give you the actual prompt. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad, any difficulty communicating? Ok. Um, so then what I'd like is if you could tell me what the issues or problems are or were as well as what you do about those issues. Ok. Oh. Um, let's see. It was probably about six years ago. My best friend, her name is Sonny. We were used to work together. Um, and her husband Steven, tall guy. Nice, nice looking man. Um, he started doing weird things like, um, he left his glasses up in a tree. I'm like, what? And then he was forgetting things and then, um, it actually got worse and worse. So about two years ago she took him Steven to the doctor. They end up doing an Alzheimer's test on them. And sure enough, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and watching Stephen go downhill. Um, it's been so sad and, and to this day he's still going downhill and he's only 59 years old. Um, when I do see him, he now talks in two word sentences, maybe three or you'll ask him a question and he just kind of looks at you and sometimes you have to do your hands or kind of visualize something for him, for him to understand. Um, I, I think he's on medicine but that doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often. I haven't been there since the, the virus. But um I kind of just hug him and I just look in his eyes and just tell him hi, Steve and it's so good to see you and he'll say good to see you too. He doesn't remember my name. He remembers Sony's name, but he knows that he knows me. But, um, as far as what I would do to help him talk, I, there's not a whole lot I can do because his conversation skills are, are gone, they're just gone. But, um, keeping it really simple for him, maybe ask a question. Uh, that's maybe real easy for him to answer. That doesn't involve memory. Like, how are you feeling today or? You know, I like your pants, Steven, something like that. So that's, that's about all I know that I could do to help him is just keep it really simple."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL28-2_109377_344583.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um it was, it was only like a week really that it was like they wanted me to stay down.

Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? Um And this can be any kind of difficulty communicating. Um We keep it kind of broad. But what I was hoping is that you could tell me what kinds of difficulties, there were what kinds of issues and also what you did about it. Um I guess just learning as my mom gets older that her hearing is not as good and I obviously have a little bit of an issue speaking up. Um And I forget that she can't hear me. Um And we've tried different, you know, my brother's tried like different hearing aids for her to see if that helps and, you know, you know, buying the headless speakers and so stuff like that, it really doesn't help. So now I'm just really practicing, trying to look at her when I talk, which has become a challenge when you have a face mask on. Um But looking at her and remembering that she can't hear me because I don't always think about it because I've known my, you know, my mom's never been hard of hearing and now she has a hard time hearing. They just have to remember to speak up. And often I don't remember that until I, until I see her looking at me going. What are you saying? So we're working on that one. So I would like you to tell me, um, uh, thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Um Something that happened to you could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to now, just any important event that you could tell me a story about. Um, the day my granddaughter was born, my husband and myself live in Florida and our son and daughter-in-law lived in, live in Ohio. And what happened know that her, um, due date was January 1st and we wouldn't be able to make it. So we went up early for Christmas and we visited with, we were going to go visit them, but we stopped in Cleveland first. And my, where my father-in-law lives and my daughter and son-in-law, my son and daughter-in-law live in Columbus. So we were at my father-in-law's and my daughter had also flown in from Florida. She just got there the night before and we stayed up really late then we woke up in the morning and we were gonna go do stuff and we got a call that said her water broke and that the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car, drove 2.5 hours to Columbus and made it there before the baby was born just waiting in the waiting room with her mother and her stepfather and then getting the text that the baby was born and that they'd be out in a little bit. So it was a very exciting day. We got to go see the baby. We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off. So once again, I'd like to show you these pictures. Take a little time and look at each one and then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end little boy was or the teenage boy it looks like was playing in the field with a soccer ball and he kicked it really?"}, {"segment_name": "wright46a_943545_1178731.wav", "aws_transcription": "Sets a ball for the prince to choose his wife amongst the women of the kingdom.

Remembering this morning, Cinderella jumped into the carriage and she was off to the bottom. When she arrived. She was unsure of what to expect. She had never left the castle before her dark and dreary life had never been opened up in this way. Before, when she walked inside and saw the beautiful dresses and the shining earrings and the beautiful chandeliers.

He was determined to try your foot anyway. And he put the slipper on Cinder Cinderella's foot and lo and behold it matched. It was a perfect fit. Oh, Prince was very pleased.

So the mother suggested to her, her young son to take an umbrella with him as he went to school, but he didn't want to take the umbrella. He decided to go to school anyways.

But then the, her stepsisters tear her dress, um, somehow her fairy godmother gets there. I think she like, I think her fairy godmother just kind of appears, she doesn't really summon her in any way and gives her like a really nice dress and, uh, um, mm, like glass slippers, carriage and all that. And she goes to the ball with that, uh, dresses, dances with the prince. Well, um, one of the stipulations her fairy godmother gave her was that it would all end at midnight. So it's like 11 45 and she rushes out to leave and go back to her home and, uh, one of her slippers falls off but she just leaves it there. And, uh, so she gets back home, I guess, doesn't really think much of it. But the prince who really liked her, finds the slipper and decides to have a, like all the women in the area, try the slipper on to see which one fits. Um, Cinderella, she's like friends with all the animals in her uh castle. She just helps them out and they, like, tell her about that or something, like maybe some of the prints there. But uh, yeah, yeah, they, so the prince comes to her castle and like puts the slipper on her foot and realizes she was the girl and then they get married and live happily ever after. All right. Great. And then last, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Ok. Um, you just get uh, two slices of bread. Um, peanut butter and jelly. You undo the jar for the peanut butter, take a knife and get a scoop of it, spread that on one of the pieces of bread and uh, make it even. Then you undo the jar of jelly. Take a spoon. I get a scoop with that. Get a scoop or two depending on how much you need. Put that on the other piece of bread on the flat even surface, um, and use the back of the spoon to spread it around. And then you put the part of the one bread that has the peanut butter on it on top of the part of the other slice of bread that has the jelly on it.

That is interesting. How was um recovery from that injury? That was the story. That was my, my latest health story.

So my wife ended up driving the whole, ended up being close to 3000 miles once we were back from that trip, including including going to Oak Ridge lab in Tennessee.

Well, the only, the only experiences of that sort of thing where most recently in 2018, in 2000 18, um, first in February, my mother-in-law, who at that point was living at a care center in Bloomington, gradually lost the ability to, to communicate very well because of health problems of just reaching a, the point where seeing wasn't conscious a lot of the time and when she was, wasn't communicating very well. And, and she died in February of that year. And then uh my father-in-law in Gainesville, Florida, we were there in January and he was doing pretty well. But in March, he was in the hospital and, but communicating fairly well, but having some issues and but was much improved when we came back here. But then he had a downturn and died in April. And then when we were in Philadelphia in May of that year, my mother had some serious uh decline in health. And when the whole family was at her room in intensive care in Philadelphia, there were times when you could talk to her and she would notice and other times that she didn't, and then sometimes she'd be talkative and make sense.

The mother in, in the meantime, had obviously called the fire brigade to get dad down out of the tree. And that's the end of the story as I see it and we were living in L A and we lost our house in an earthquake. And at which time we decided to move to Arizona. Um shortly after we arrived in Arizona, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me because I knew no one here. I had no friends. Uh Luckily I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me and put me on a drug which I had to take called Tamoxifen. Uh I live in the lakes in which is a very pleasant place to live. And over the years over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication. I got to know very many friends who are extremely good, very supportive to me. And uh I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been 11 years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And up till now touch wood. Um, there is no recurrence of it. I can remember when I first I worked for the BBC, I was, I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney, Australia. And when I left with my German husband, when I left Australia to come back to Germany, my, my, my German, my gift of the German language was not very large. And um I already had one child who was born in Australia and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home. And I had to do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could, which wasn't very easy because I had a sister in law who was not very kind at that time. And every time I made a mistake in Germany, she used to, she used to laugh and make fun of me. And I used to be very resentful about that. But because I was, I guess so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects and I, I think this has something to do with musical ability because I'm able to hear how a language sounds, I learned, I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say. And that's, um, that's all I could say about language difficulties very much so. Um, I was four years old when the Second World War started and I was living in Cardiff that time, which is the capital of Wales. And, uh, we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit. And my parents had decided to send me to stay, to live with my grandparents who lived closer to the coast in Wales.

Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace and what was happening in the palace at the time was that the prince uh was it was time for the prince to be married. And so his father was saying that that they, he needed to decide who he was gonna marry. So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village. So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family, her stepmother received the invitation and her stepmother told her daughters about it who got very excited, but they didn't really say anything to Cinderella. And the daughter started preparing their dresses and getting the things ready for the ball. But they were not gonna give a dress to Cinderella. So she went into her treasure chest. She opened up a book and had some old fabric in it and she looked at that and, and decided to make herself a dress for the ball. But then when the time came for the sisters to all go to the ball, they said, oh, you need to fix my dress and you need to fix my dress and they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs. And before long, she had nothing to wear to the ball and they were not gonna have her go with them. So off the sisters went, Cinderella was so sad. She went out into the garden and there she saw happened to see uh a, a pumpkin and, and the mice and pretty soon uh a fairy godmother appeared and the fairy godmother said to Cinderella some magical words and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage. She turned the mice into horses or something or horses and she turned Cinderella uh ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown. Cinderella went to the ball but the fairy godmother said you must leave by midnight because then the the coach will become a pumpkin and your dress will turn back to rags. The Cinderella walked into the ball and the prince and she began to dance, but at midnight the clock struck and she knew she had to leave. So she ran out of the castle, she ran down the steps and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers. She ran and ran into the fields until indeed her dress returned to rags and the coach turned it back into a pumpkin and one of the mice had a key for some. Oh, I know because I guess they locked her up or something. I can't remember why, what was going on in that picture. But they uh the mice unlocked the key. Oh, yeah, because the prince was coming to, um, to see whose foot fit that glass slipper because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry. And when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe, uh they tried the shoe on the two sisters and it didn't fit. Uh, but Cinderella was locked up, but the mice found the key unlocked Cinderella's room. So she came running down, she tried on the slipper. It fit.

There was a, a one fellow on the plane, changed his seat to another seat and then my son wanted to move. Also, I don't remember why, I don't know why he wanted to move, but he wanted to move. So he sat next to this first fellow who moved, he sat next to him. Well, they struck up a conversation and this other fellow happened to be a pastor down in Haiti. I think he had about four churches. So they became acquainted and my son was down there to look to help people. And so pastor said the next day that he, he wanted to take him around and show him around the country sack which he did. And on the way back to my son's hotel Hotel Montana, the earthquake struck and my son had wanted to go right on back to the hotel, but the pastor wanted to take him out to another spot and show him another area or church or something they looked at and churches.

One is that help me communicate with this person, one is don't ask questions because they don't like questions and the other is to get them at the right time of day, um, or a good or if he calls me, um, he, he usually will have something to say. Um But if I really feel like I need to talk to him, um I know not to call him in the morning, you know. And, um, and I know to hang up if he's, uh, busy and then he'll tell me.

Once upon a time, a little girl was playing outside riding her tricycle with her cat and her dog and her cat got away from her and ran up and got stuck in a tree. So she called for her dad because the cat was stuck in the tree. So her dad went and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree to try to go get the cat. But the cat got scared and ran out on a tiny little branch and the dad couldn't reach it. And when he was trying to move the ladder fell over and he couldn't get down at that time, the girl's dog went crazy and started barking at the dad and the cat in the tree. So they had to call 911 and the firemen came with their ladder and they saved the day they got the dad down, they got the cat down and everybody was happy to see. And all right, so remember with Cinderella, I'm gonna show you the picture book. Um they automatically move forward after 30 seconds. However, I can move forward if you're ready before then and we can go back and review any of them after we finish going through the book. Um And then I'll take it away and ask you to tell me that's great. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Mhm. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. The anything you wanna review? Nope. All right. So whenever you are ready, um go ahead and tell me the story of Cinderella. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella and she lived alone with her dad in the little village because her mother had died when she was young. One day, her dad decided that she, he needed to get married again so that she would have a mother. So he met and he married a widow that had two small girls of her own and all things seemed good. At first, she was kind of mean, but she was ok until Cinderella's dad died. And then the stepmother got very, very mean and her daughters were very, very mean. Also they made Cinderella do everything around."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL11-1_271901_506090.wav", "aws_transcription": "So then we started pursuing the adoption route. And uh very interesting. I never thought that all how I, I never thought how complicated it was to do that and, and all that goes into that and it was a long process and probably took close to a year. We went through a domestic, a adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute. So that was kind of heartbreaking at the time and then finally adopted my daughter when she was about two months old. So, you know, we always say we were just waiting for her and, and of course, she um always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her and we didn't have any choice with him. He's just what we call. So, you know, I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because I gave birth to a child. And also I adopted a child. I think it gave me interesting insight to both sides of it. And there's certainly pros and cons to both ways to be becoming a mom. As well. But, you know, a lot of people say, oh, you could never adopt. It wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah. She's my child. Just like my son is. There's no difference between them. So, um, and she, and she's interesting too because she says that, um, she wants to adopt when she's ready to start a family that she would like to adopt a child from the foster system. So, I think that's kind of interesting her perspective on that. All right, same idea here. Um, take a look at these pictures. They also tell a story. Um, I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story, the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp. The dad stood up, got the ball and looked out the window and glared at his little boy. Um, these pictures tell a story, take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school and his mother said, Johnny, you need to take an umbrella. It's going to rain today. And he said, mom, it's not raining. I don't need an umbrella. And he left. And sure enough as he got halfway to school, it started raining and then it started raining harder. So he turned around and he went back home and he told his mom you were right. It started raining and she was not very happy with him. And so he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school. So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this store in this picture and then tell me a story about what you see. Um, ideally a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Ok. So the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard and she was playing with her cat and her dog and all of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree. And so she was very upset and she called for her dad and she said, Dad, Sparky is chased peanut up the tree. And so the dad said, well, let me see if I can go get the cat. So Sparky is still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree. Dad climbed up the tree but he couldn't reach the cat. The cat scared to death."}, {"segment_name": "richardson195_397193_631257.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um So there was a wealthy widow with his daughter. And the daughter also had a dog who remarried to a not so nice woman with her, not so nice Children. And they had an evil cat. And so eventually the, the father passed away and the daughters and the mother just kind of ran Ciro's life. They made her their servant in a nutshell. And Cinderella did everything that she was asked to even though she didn't like it, but she always dreamed of being a princess at the castle. And so conveniently the prince needed uh the king wanted the prince to be married and made the duke in charge of it or the general or I think it was the duke if I recall it. Um And he's made him in charge of getting the son to be married. So they decided to put on a ball. So the invitations are sent out and Cinderella gets one as as well do the um the evil steps. This dude and the stepsisters are gonna go and Cinderella says she can go and the mothers, the stepmother says that she can, but she has to do all of her chores and find a dress. So Cinderella's animal friends make her address uh the birds and mice. Um And then when she gets all presentable and she goes downstairs to leave, they tear her dress up and tell her that she can't go. And so then they leave and she's very sad and her fairy godmother shows up out of nowhere and says that she'll give her all the things that she needs, but it expires at midnight. The blessing. And so Cinderella gets a nice dress and the carriage and the mice are turned into her guards or whatever and she's brought to the castle and to the ball and the prince immediately rushes to her much to the hatred of the stepsisters and that life. And you know, they have a good time and they fall in love but the it hits midnight and so all of her stuff starts disintegrating and the advisor to the prince, the general or duke or whatever his name was, um, chases after her, but she gets away but she drops a slipper, one of her shoes and everything else goes away except for her shoes. And so she's left with one and they have one. And so the prince says that he wants to and she goes back home and the princess that he wants to like find her, so he decides to try to shoot on every woman. And so eventually at some point, he gets to their house and the stepsisters can't fit in it and the stepmother doesn't fit in it. So they try Cinderella and it's a perfect fit and it's a match made in heaven. And all right. I see. Ok. And then one more um one more story, it's a little bit different. I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I have never made one before. Ok. Do I assume that you already have all the ingredients available or do you need to go and get them? Um, it's kind of up to you. I'm just gonna assume you already have it. Ok? Um, first you're going to want to take the twist tie, take the bread, take the twist tie off, open it, take off the first piece of bread that he'll love. Um, the heel of the loaf, take it out, take two pieces of bread, place them on a plate. So one side by facing up 2012 and you're gonna wanna take a knife and then place it into the peanut butter and scrape peanut butter onto the knife."}, {"segment_name": "wright57a_380166_613983.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. Um Cinderella's father married a woman which was became her stepmother and the stepmother had two daughters. And um so they all moved in together and then the father died. And so Cinderella was left in the care of the wicked stepmother and she was very mean to her and made her work very hard to do all the chores. And the steps sisters were very mean also and, and they called her names and made her do all their chores as well. And so she made friends with all the animals and because she was lonely and, and then um and then an announcement came, someone came to the door and announced that there was going to be a ball. And so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball. And since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters, the mother didn't want her to go because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince. So she locked Cinderella in the tower uh and they went to the ball and so the, the animals um oh well, this was before the animals made Cinderella dress and it was real pretty. And that's what infuriated the stepmother and she tore up the dress and then locked her in the room and then Cinderella was crying and then she, then the very godmother came and let her out of the room. And with the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers and fixed her hair all up nice and turned pumpkin into a coach, turned mice into white horses and the dog into a coachman. And, and so she was able to go to the ball and she met the Pran dance with him. And the very godmother told her that she had to leave by midnight or everything would return as it was. And so she was dancing with the prince and the clock started to strike midnight and she said I have to go and he didn't want her to leave, but she started to run away and she lost one of the glass slippers and she ran and ran and got back in the coach and they started going down the road and then everything when the clock start at 12 turned back to the way it was.

There was a grand ball going on at the great palace and the invitation came that said all the ladies of the house could come to the grand ball. So everybody was really excited that they were gonna go to the grand ball. So everybody was getting ready. Cinderella had a nice dress and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters. So her stepsisters got jealous and wrecked her dress. Uh made fun of her. Cinderella was upset and she couldn't go to the ball because her dress was rude. Stepsisters just laughed at her and made fun of her. So Cinderella stayed at home, the step sister is over out to the ball. Meanwhile, there was a magic mouse that uh granted Cinderella wish and Cinderella wish you could go to the ball and have a nice dress, go to the ball and, and so, oh it was a very godly the fairy godmother granted the voice to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was turn the pumpkin into a carriage so that she could be escorted in to the to grand ball, nice carriage with her nice dress.

So Cinderella was so enlightened, enthusiastic about being at the ball with a beautiful dress and now dancing with the prince, it was like a dream for me. But uh a very godmother said you have to be home before midnight. So otherwise everything won't go back to normal. So Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight. So she runs out the out of the ball right after the dance with the prince. But the prince wanted know more about Cinderella. And so the prince chased after Cinderella was running down the steps, lost one of her slippers, but she didn't care that she had to get home before midnight. So she gets in her carriage and often gets so escorted away back to her own, but she makes it home in time. So everything turns back to normal. Her nice, her beautiful dress turned back to another, just an apron dress. The carriage turns back into a pumpkin.

Um I travel a fair amount for, for my job. Uh At least I used to uh not go anywhere right now. So, um but she was, she grew up with, with the Disney Princesses. Um She would love Disney movies when she, when she was really little like two or three and this is probably a testament to, to bad parenting. Um, we had to stop, uh, letting her watch Mary Poppins and bed knobs and broomsticks because she was developing a British accent. And, uh, so that was kind of problematic for us and we had to kind of dial dial back that frequency with which she was watching those movies. But that's, that, that's how much she was really into Disney. So, um, you know, we got up early one morning and, and we told her that, um, you know, we were driving me to the airport because I've got this, you know, I gotta fly out for work.

We're getting on it, you know, you're all packed, we're going to Disney World and uh I was so excited uh to see her reaction and she did not react at all. It was like, what?

So Leo was getting ready to walk to school and his mom said, hey, you, you really should take this umbrella because it is going to start raining and you're gonna be really uncomfortable when you're walking to school with no umbrella and you get all wet. He doesn't really want to take it. So he says no, thanks mom. I I got this, I'm in a hurry and get to school really fast and I'll beat the rain. So he says goodbye.

The rain's coming down harder and faster and he's not gonna get to school. He's barely even made it a a quarter of the way to school. So he is going to rush back to the house as wet as he is and have to look his mom in the eye and say mom, you were right. I probably should have taken the umbrella and I'm sorry, I didn't, but I really need to take it now.

Here is a picture, I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. So um try to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end and you can keep this picture up as you go. So you can use it to describe. Does that make sense? Mhm. Ok.

It was a uh a day that this little girl was playing outside and she was clearly playing with her dog and riding her bike and the cat got out and the cat ended up in the tree. So she had to ask her dad, uh, to come help her get the cat out of the tree. And then her, her dad got stuck in the tree.

Uh, one of them is to get out the bread that's already cut and uh put peanut butter on it, actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store. And so all you have to do is just use one and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into the, into the jar and you can put it right on the bread and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Very lazy. Very easy. The good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread. Cut it in six inch long pieces, slice it long ways so that it's open. It's nice and crunchy on top. It's very soft on the interior. You take your peanut butter, crunchy and some and regular, you mix those together, you put it on the peanut, you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich. You take the jelly. Uh I wouldn't use grape jelly but, uh, you can use other kinds of jelly and I, I like strawberry. Sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together. I put it on there and then I take that sandwich and I put it in the microwave and I heat it so that the peanut butter, the jelly and the bread all soak in together. I still have crunchy on the top, but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm. And then I eat that. Uh, four years ago. I, uh, uh, had my knees replaced. I had them both done at the same time. It was, uh, scheduled for July the fifth. Uh, however, they, uh follow up on the scheduling. So it wasn't done until the next week, which is, I think July though 12, uh, we, I went into the hospital, uh, at, uh, seven in the morning, 6 30 or seven in the morning. Um, they prepped me and I went into the operating room about eight and woke up about 11, 11 15 with two knees. They told me to go ahead and use the, uh, the morphine drip for pain.

He apparently retrieves the umbrella when he, after he goes back to his house and starts out again. This is a picture of two people. One looks like a rescuer because he has on an orange vest.

So her dad goes up the tree to get the cat for her, but the ladder falls and he can't really get back down and neither can he get the cat.

He said, no, I don't want to take the umbrella. Well, you better you might get wet. Nope, I'm not going to. So the little boy began walking to school and sure enough, his mother was right, it began to rain and then it began to rain harder and harder and harder.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat and the cat was chased by a dog and the cat ran up the tree and way out onto the limb as the dog stood barking there and then she called her dad and she said, daddy come and help me, help me get my cat down. So the next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the tree and he got part way up and then he got stuck and he could not get down and the cat wouldn't come down. And somebody must have seen this and called the fire department because finally they came with their ladders and they probably shoot away the dog and they put the ladder up against the tree and they helped the father down.

Get out the bread knife slice two slices of bread. Then I would put the knife back in the cabinet. We would take the two slices of bread, put them on the toaster and push down the toaster. Then I would wrap up, twist the bag, hold the bag at one end and spin it a few times, fold it under and open the refrigerator and put the bread back in the refrigerator. While the refrigerator is open, I would find a Joe jelly and put it on the counter and close the door. Peanut butter is probably in the cabinet, but it actually there isn't any except for what we use for the mouse traps under the house. So we get the peanut butter and get a knife out of the door and spread the peanut butter on one of the slices of toast. After it came out of the toaster, it is out of order like most recipes where it's like what was I supposed to do when, when I do that and, uh, I'd lick off the knife and then I'd stick the knife in the jelly and spread the jelly on the other piece of bread, which is now toast and assemble the two slathered pieces of toast.

And Cinderella has to do all the work around the house, feed the horses and everything like that. Then one day a king tells his son that he needs to find a bride. So the king tells his son, I'm going to have a dance and invite all the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to the dance and you can pick one and that's the one you'll have to marry.

Um I had, I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell, it was just, it had no like, you know, that old song, what a difference a day makes. I mean from the pregnancy, which was just wonderful. I ate everything I wanted. I felt terrific. I was working full time. Uh My freezer looked like an all right convention. I could eat, you know, my crinkle cuts, my shoe strings with pasta. I could do anything. I looked like meat loaf. By the time I got to the hospital I have to say and my, my, my obstetrician, you know, during the, the build up to this would say you'll be sorry. He and I said, you know, I cannot imagine regretting this. You know, I'm eating, I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the, the, the the it's two pieces of pound cake, you know, with the Honda in, in the middle. So then I get to the hospital and um it was really nasty. It was really, it was probably the worst experience I ever had. Um I was told that if I had, um, um, automatic weapons, there would have been no one alive left on the Maternity ward. That's what I was told. And, um, I did, um, it did spark, um, revenge in me that I actually carried out. You know. Um, my, my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook. He said, well, we're just gonna break your water. It'll move things along. I said, no, don't step back, step back, just leave me alone. I can do this myself, you know. And then, um, he kept saying, relax, I don't understand why you're not relaxed. And this is psychological. I'm sure every time he said, relax, I became even more infuriated. You know, this is the effect it had on me. And he wasn't listening. When I said, stop saying that when you tell someone stop doing X, you expect them to stop doing that. So, anyhow, to fast forward, my daughter was beautiful. She was born, smiling right away, recognized my voice. It was just the most special experience of my whole life. And um, so now I went for my first postpartum checkup and I'm sitting on the table and he, you know, does the finger prick and to get some blood out and he turns around and he puts the little tube in the machine and he turns it on and the machine is worrying and I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock. It happened really fast and I threw him onto the table and then I jumped on top of him and put my knee in his groin. And I was, his glasses were askew and he, his tie was crooked. And I said, relax, relax. I don't understand why you're not relaxed. What's the matter? You know, it was such a calamity and, you know, it was all in good fun because later on, you know, he and his wife used to work in his office and they had a nurse too and they said selfishly, Linda, we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives.

But, uh, I would take and, uh, spread the peanut butter on the one piece of bread and then take the spoon and drop some jelly on the other piece of bread and spread the jelly evenly over that piece of bread. Put the two pieces together ready. We have a real pickle here. Uh, looks like the family cat has been chased up the tree by their dog and the father has gone to rescue the cat, his daughter and just crying wanting the cat to come down. She's off her tricycle. The father gets up on the lamb of the tree, the stepladder falls down and then to the rescue, somebody must have called, there's a bird watching it all, but somebody must have called the fire department and here they come running with a, with a ladder. All right. Um, I haven't had a stroke, but I did have a couple of stents, um, done two years ago, this past February. And I smoked up until that time, up until about two days before. Then it was February the ninth or 10th. And the surgery was on a Wednesday in the procedure. And Monday I ran out of cigarettes. I had one Sunday morning and I thought, oh, Pete, I don't want, I'm not gonna do any smoking. They're gonna make me stop anyway, once I get in the hospital. So, so I didn't, I had that last one Monday morning and I haven't smoked since then. But getting back to my story, Wednesday at 11 a.m. had already been to the doctor. He had done a stress test and he, and said that we needed to look at you more closely. And what they do is they, uh, they put you somewhat under and they go up through your groin with the camera and take a good look at your heart. And, uh, so I was sort of out of it, but I do remember it and I remember, uh, the doctor's name was Richard. Richard. I can't think of the last name, but they called him Rapid Richard because he was so quick. And, uh, he went in and I says, I must have woke up. I said, uh, well, Doc are you there? He says, yep, I'm there. And I said, uh, how's it lock? He says, well, we're gonna have a couple of cents put in and there's some, got some problems, says, all right, must have gone back out a little bit later on. I said, uh, why are you doing? Are you about to do? And he says, just finishing up, we should be done here in just a few minutes and then I went back to sleep and, uh, I don't remember them rolling me back to my room or getting in my van.

That's probably the like the singular event that's most significant. Ok, I'll tell you a story. This is a story um about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind and I still still is making sense. So my first semester of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa in Iowa City, but my family is from DC and I had a car and, uh, so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car. Um It's about 1000 miles. So it generally takes about two days. Uh So the first semester back, um it's winter, I am driving across I 80 which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn. So it is an extremely boring, repetitive drive. There's a lot of, you know, driver tunnel vision that happens and it's cold and gray. So it's not even pretty green field. It's just empty, empty, empty fields. Um But I'm, I'm kind of proud of myself because it's my first semester went. Well, I was, you know, independent, excited. Um, so I'm on I 80 in sort of the middle of Illinois and there's a slowdown and it's very flat so I can see a hat. I don't see that there's construction, I don't really see an accident but I, you know, figure something's happened probably a minor accident. It looks like it's a rubber necking delay. It's kind of pissing me off. I 80 at this point is only two lanes in each direction. Um, and there's like no exits, nothing built along it and we get closer and closer and closer and I still cannot see what's going on. I'm just like, what, what could this be? And we get a little closer and I see, ok, it looks like I'm on, I'm in the left lane. Um, and then there's a medium between the, you know, eastbound and westbound routes and I'm going east. Um, and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left and it looks as I get closer, like an animal and I get closer and it looks like a fairly large animal. And I'm thinking, is it a cow, is it a moose? I mean, I mean that there would be a moose in Illinois, but it looks, it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it. So I getting a little bit more for giving up the rubbernecking delay. But I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes going. Why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal wasting my time? I just want to get home. Um, I get closer and I can see that there's these kind of large hind legs so it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car and there's kind of a long tail and it's brown and it's this big hump. Oh my God. And I get, I'm getting closer and closer and closer and I, you know, my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern magic going. What is this thing? I don't, it's not a cow, it's not a deer, it's too big to be a dog. And I'm literally, as I'm passing it, like my head is, you know, we're just creeping on my head is sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view and it's only till it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that it, my mind kind of pattern matches and goes. It's a kangaroo. You know, again, I have to turn around and look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me. And I felt like the next five miles going. There's no way I was a kangaroo and they go, but it, it wasn't anything else. It was a kangar. It was clearly a kangaroo I saw the ears, I saw the big, massive tail, I saw the big hind legs. I saw little tiny front legs. It was a kangar. And so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know, I just don't know. I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo. And I've even, I mean, this was ok. So this was the winter of 2000, 2001.

So I let them do that instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle. And finally, they got upset with that and told me to stop. Well, I immediately went into shock and being in basic training there as much suggestion to do as one is told in myriad manner of forms directly and indirectly. So my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through.

In fact that I was unable to take the B DS, which are the battle dress uniform, which have a very, very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants from being able to be lifted up to my knee, my calf was so swollen. Uh, unfortunately, that was the major holiday of that. Um, the whole fort combination of its anniversary and fourth of July. So the crew at the clinic on that Saturday, which then being a Saturday buses never ran. So I had to walk about 2.5 miles on that condition did a very cursory and less than effective. Look at my injury and described me as rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches. The next, without and just giving me mild anti inflammatories the next day because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity, my battery was given KP duty and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing KP because everyone else had been working and I had just gotten on to a sick leave myself. I was in shock continually this entire time. So I never volunteered for any of the KP duties and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very, very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee. Well, regardless to say, as I got back on Monday, the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very, very traumatic problems in my symptoms and pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neural dysfunction within my calf and knee itself.

In this kingdom, there was a family who the mother died and they had one child called Cinderella.

The stepdaughters and stepmother did not like Cinderella and they treated her like a maid. She had to do all the work. And one day a letter came in the mail announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom so that the prince could find a suitable wife.

So the day of the ball came and the stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy um horse and carriage. And the godmother did her magic. She turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. She turned uh mice into horses and she used her magic powers and her wand to dress Cinderella in a beautiful ball ground. And she saw that Cinderella got into the carriage and went off to the ball. Her only admonition was you must be home by midnight, Cinderella entered the ballroom and everyone turned to look at her because of her beauty and her graciousness.

She fled so quickly that she lost one of her glass slippers and root and she fled back to her carriage and was taken home to the barn yard. And the reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight or else the the spell would wear off and her true identity would be revealed. So for days afterwards, Cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience but also saddened by her lot in life and the fact that it was such a short lived pleasure. But one day a knock came on the door and it was a, a court magistrate from the prince who had this slipper and was going around to households trying to find this special lost um woman. And he knew if the shoe fit, he'd identified this mysterious guest and the shoe fit for Cinderella. So with that, she was whisked away and rescued from the arms of her diabolical relatives and brought to the prince and they married and lived happily ever after. All right, now, we'll move on to something a little different. Will you please tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? That's exactly what we did the last time it is. Ok.

You'll use one knife to spread the peanut butter on one of these faced up slices of bread. You'll have to open the jar first. But once you've opened the jar, you'll have to stick the knife in and spread the peanut butter on and enough to cover the bread kind of with a bit of abundance. So none of the bread shows through. Then you'll take the other knife. You'll open the other can, which is of the jam and you'll put the knife in and spread the other slice of bread with this jelly also liberally so that you can't see the bread"}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL14-2_816038_1047471.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um my sister would not lend me her tricycle.

And then, then the next problem was that she didn't have anything to wear. So then she waves her wand and miraculously, she's got a cool hair do, she's got um, her hair is all done up. She is wearing a beautiful white dress and glass slippers. So off, she goes to the ball, she gets to the ball. She looks so amazing that no one knew who she was. And of course the prince was like, oh, he's wonderful. And so then the prince um can't take his eyes off of, off of her dances with her all night until the clock starts to strike 12. So then um she remembers something that the fairy, the older woman, the fairy God fa fairy godmother had said you have to get home before the last strike of 12 at midnight. So she runs out of the castle because she doesn't want anyone to know her true identity.

So they send out the one of their uh servants to go out and try to find this woman by having all of them try on this class slipper. Of course, it's not fitting. It's not fitting ironically that no women seem to have a foot that fits into these. I don't understand why does she have like, such tiny feet? I don't get it. But at any rate, yeah, that doesn't seem to work. And, uh, then somehow because of the mice opening the door, she's had been locked upstairs in some sort of a tower. I don't know what it was.

It was, it was just a regular training flight to add our to my logbook and that of the airplane and also proficiency just practice, practice this practice that. Well, in those times, we um um we had a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway and um 340 knots air speed when directly over the air. When we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back the airplane onto a wing and suck back on the stick in a very tight 180 degree turn in order to dissipate air speed sufficiently that it would be safe to drop the, the landing gear, the flaps and the speed brakes, which I did and that was called the downwind leg at 180 degrees. After that, the airplane is slow enough so that we would, we would have not have touched the throttle that would have cut power completely and just bring it on around a full 360 degree turn and then land on the runway. Um, the, um, the, the legs of the, of, of the pattern are called the approach 180 degrees. The downwind 90 degrees from that is the base and following that is the final. So you're actually flying in a circle. Well, here I am on the base leg with no power. All the garbage is out. We call it garbage. The speed breaks the flaps and the landing gear and all of a sudden I'm about, I don't know, 3 400 ft off the ground no more than that, maybe 5 6 7 800 ft, something like that. I'm not really sure. The airplane started to shutter. A sh shuttering is the sign of a stall. That means the, when an airplane stalls, it means it's falling out of the sky. And I knew immediately people do not survive these situations like this. And yet I automatically didn't, I almost didn't have time to think, but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of records off the end of the runway and I didn't want that to happen.

I said, it's just like my head's too tired to hold up my neck anymore. So then they did an MRI and they said, oh, yeah, good. Thank you. Try to say something. Then I did 100 and 40 steroid shots over a year and I gained \u00a350 and I looked like a balloon and I was not addicted, but I, I lived on Oxycodeine, um, because the pain was just so tremendously bad.

You're lucky you didn't lose the use of your right hand because there's almost nothing left of your nerve over there. So then they scheduled me, they cut open my neck, moved everything to the side, put some Titanium rods in there. I went through some physical therapy and I was off work for three months and I couldn't drive and I couldn't run the vacuum even though I felt great. I wasn't allowed to.

And then those uh the, the way the scope went, uh the second one, they were able to get some additional pieces that had fallen out. The third one, they were looking around at the knee and I remember distinctly the doctor saying, oh, what was that? And he moved the scope a little bit and saw a piece of meniscus floating by the scope and he says, oh, we must have missed this on this, on the last surgery. So that was that. So after that, I was still relatively young. Uh But it got to the point where I started getting uh pains. Once I was 55 I started getting pain. I went to an orthopedic surgeon. Uh He worked with me for several years, did injections trying to take care of uh lob the knee. So it would be ok. And eventually, those, uh, lubrication did not work. So that's when they went in for the total knee replacement. And since then I've had lots of fun. Uh, I've actually been back to a different surgeon because we found out through going to a different surgeon that the appliance that they used in my knee. I was one version and the guy that I went to said, wonder why they used that one. And what they found was my PC L which holds one part of my knee to the other part of my knee was basically, he used the word mangled. So it had been stretched out and twisted so much that my knee would pop out of place. Um, and he gave me two options. One was surgery and that changed the appliance. I'd have to do the full another total knee replacement and put in a new appliance or go rehab. So I did rehab. I actually did a unique kind of rehab. I use a personal trainer and they were able to send him the information about my injury. So he was able to work with me knowing what the problem was. He worked with me to get to the point where I was in very good shape on the knee. I still have problems, but most of the way I've been recovering, um, our next prompt, uh, we can move on here. Um Have you ever had an experience with people who have a difficult time? Communicating. I have had a, a case where I was working with, uh, and a, a person that was doing that, a network evaluation.

Um There's a ball that uh two teams of 11 people each vie for control of. Um Yeah, so I think of that those 11 1 is a goalie. Each, each team has a goalkeeper and a goal uh on a pitch of grass about the size of a football field maybe. Yeah, so like 300 ft, uh lengthwise, maybe like 100 and 50 ft width wise. Um So that, that comprises the boundaries of the playing field, the playing space and the 11 players including the goalie, um comprise halves of the uh playing space. So that, that playing space is cut in half, there's 11 on one side, 11 on the other and then at half time sides are switched. But um the way it starts is um a coin is flipped and whoever wins the, the coin toss, that team will start kicking the ball to its teammates um from the center of the field. Um So what happens is it's 11 on 11, there are uh different lines of that 11, the way it's uh ordered on, on the field, the, the people in the front of that group of 11. Their main task is to score on the opposing goal. Um, the ones behind them are kind of defense and offense they can score, but their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score and then the people behind them, it's usually three or four are like the last line of defense, they're called defenders and they keep the ball far away from the goalie if they can. And the goal is the absolute last line of defense kind of guarding the goal and keeping the ball from going into the goal. The major rules is that the only person that can use their hands except on out of bounds, throws are the goalies. The goalies can use their hands at any time. But like any of the players, they ever touch the ball, that's a penalty with their hand. They, they're just moving the ball by doing what's called dribbling or passing with their feet. Um, scoring happens when the opposing team kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net into the netted goal and they can do that through what's called a penalty kick, uh a corner kick, um or just regular gameplay kick into the goal. Um The duration the contest will last 70 to 90 minutes and the teams that do the best are constantly moving the ball in triangles. I think this is my theory where they're passing. Um The ball to each other in triangular formations, they're spreading out in triangular formations over the playing field uh and giving uh the person with the ball, like, you know, options of, of, of passage, you know, passing of the ball to uh two people at different points on the triangle.

You got left over clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear and she was usually in the kitchen and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball, I think in prince chairman or somebody and evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they can get married and be rich. And um, so they all got fancied up to go to the ball and Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go and she wanted to go and she was crying about it and a good fairy godmother came along. I'm not quite sure how she got there. Um, and she was able to turn ordinary things and creatures around her into fabulous ones and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and old mags into beautiful horses and turn the mice into something anyway. And she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers. She went to the ball after everybody else had already. And when she came in, the prince saw and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her and they dance the night away. And the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry. Then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight, all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning.

I wonder if you could tell me what you remember about any illness or injury that you've had. Ah, I think, apparently already told, told the story of the elbow. Hm. So, previous, what else have I ever had? Ah, there's the thumb. Which one is it? Oh, it's that one? It was, that was when I worked at Fermilab in Chicago for a couple of years and I lived in an area called West Chicago and had a motorcycle I bought when I was living in Bloomington after I'd graduated geology degree, but didn't wanna leave. Well, I didn't leave town until I got the job at Fermilab because I kind of, for, to, to do something. I was working for the university physical plant, doing sheet metal and roofing stuff and wasn't getting paid much, but it was enough to buy a Kawasaki H one 500 CC two stroke three cylinder motorcycle, which was very fast, but handled really badly and so be very careful. But, um, the only real wreck I ever got into it. I was in Chicago and I was going home from Fermi Lab back to the house, I lived in sort of in the country between the Dupage County Airport and the, the rural town of West Chicago. And as I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and the bike started vibrating really badly and I didn't recognize it because I've had back tires go low before, but never had a front tire go low before. So all I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder on the front brake and push the rear brake. And since the front tire had gotten really low, it just suddenly like down into the street and tossed me into the ditch. No, I got up out of the ditch and there are two problems. One is that, uh, back then I wasn't very good at wearing protective safety gear. So I was riding a motorcycle without a shirt, even have pants and shoes and I learn about a shirt. So I had gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder that, that I hit the shoulder. But the other problem was the thumb was just kind of dangling like it wasn't connected anywhere because it wasn't. This phone here was just broke and clear off. So this was really too many years ago to remember. It's 1979. But I think some of the neighbors are driving into the same gravel drive that I lived in and, um, help me roll the motorcycle kind of up the little hill a little bit and park the motorcycle and then I, maybe they give me ride home. I don't know. I just remember getting into my car. Hey, and then I had two cars. So one of the cars that would go to the, uh, Dupage County Hospital and went to the emergency room and they looked it over and they bandaged it up and made me appointment to come back in on Monday. It was Friday. Apparently I went back Friday."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto10a_441776_670346.wav", "aws_transcription": "Well, more recently, I guess the whole world has suffered. Just what do you want to call it, crisis, recession, depression, whatever it may be. The financial, from the financial end of it. I, on paper only, I guess I've lost maybe $100,000 but as long as you don't sell nothing, you haven't lost it. If you understand what I'm saying, that's where a lot of people and I don't understand the business world telling these people, especially the, the mutual fund brokers and that telling people to cash their stuff in and go to a mutual fund. Well, that's, to me that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example, I've got a lot of Procter and Gamble and it was up, oh, last, last summer, I guess, around $74 a share right now. It's about 48 or 49. Now tell somebody to sell that and take a 30 $35 share loss. It's kind of ridiculous to me. But now that, I guess that's the way these agents, you know, make their money by talking to people, the public into relinquishing what they've got. That's good. Now, I don't say you should keep all your stocks, but you give them a blue chip, you know, then, I mean, I, I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive Cheers. As a matter of fact, this last Friday I went out and bought 1000 shares of Ford and also I put in, uh, about 1000 shares of A K Steel. Now, if you really are being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier and I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday. When you get a lot of, uh, diversified, you know, opinions and, uh, to, to, to sell the automobiles out, it doesn't make sense. But now in a K Steel, that's the same way. They were $74 a share. And now I put a bid in for $6 a share and I'm pretty good. It was, it was 5 76 when I started playing phone tag with the broker. And, uh, so like I said, last Friday, I went to the third, met a broker there and we put it in a buy for now. If you don't understand what a buy means, it will sell 6 21. I said when it goes down to six, buy me 1000 shares of it. And my reason for doing that is Obama wants to, uh, excuse me, improve all the infrastructure, ok. Infrastructure means steel. And that's where a case still comes in and all that. They haven't completed you know, through Congress, what they are wanting to do, what they're trying to say by American. I really don't believe in that. But, uh, it's really gonna push the American steel up and all American industries are gonna start making recoveries. But it was funny, I just listened this morning on television before I'd come down here and, uh, the state of Kentucky is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States. We're trying to pass that right now. So that's, to me, that was the most interesting thing to me. And the, uh, the worst thing was losing all that money in my age. Of course, I don't have to sell anything and I'm not gonna sell it and maybe my heirs will help my wife will.

We came in as uh I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe and needed an assistant. The assistant was brought in and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us, we all kind of looked at each other and said, what did he just say? He's Filipino.

Ok. The end. Well, the most recent episode is a broken bone, but it was, it's not a big deal. I had been having pain in my left foot. The more I walked, the more it hurt, but I really just kind of ignored it. I was more concerned about my right foot with the toenail looking like it was lifting off the bed. And I didn't quite know what to do about this. So I made an appointment with the foot doctor, but my foot doctor is in Waukegan, Illinois. And uh let's see, how did that work? Oh, boy, we came, we came directly from, we had been on a cruise and we had visited our Children in, in Orlando and we came directly from Orlando to walk Egan. So I could see the foot doctor. And uh man, I don't remember what happened. But anyway, when I finally got to the foot doctor, uh she just explained that the reason the nail was lifting off is because when she had removed the growing toenail, a new nail was growing underneath. So she just took the top nail off, took half a minute that was done. And then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting. And so of course, she feeling it and found a very painful spot and that led to x rays which showed there was a small broken bone which led to my having to wear a boot for a month and then come back for more X rays. So I came back to Arizona. Then I turned around and went back to Waukegan more X rays. And the stupid thing is not healed yet, which is usual for me because this whole scenario happened once before. And uh she says another month with the boot and to do ultrasound treatments every day and I forgot to do it. No, I did it yesterday. And, uh, she also told me that when I came back, when I would be coming back at the end of this month, she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else. And of course she's following him. And nice thing about the visit is I really like that foot doctor is a person and she's pregnant and she's gonna have her second child.

So in preparation for the ball is the steps sisters were getting ready and preparing their thing. Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house and then they saw how sad she was and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such. But, um, Cinderella, I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball. So as the day became closer, the stepsisters were getting ready to go and they had beautiful dresses and she had to help mend them. And um, let's see what happened.

And um she realized she had to go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight.

And then the prince was found the slipper and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper. So he and his coachman, whoever they are, went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on and they did come to the home of the um where Cinderella lived and they, the steps sisters tried to get that shoe on their foot wasn't gonna fit.

And Ralph remembered the time when he was little and he had hit a baseball into his neighbor's yard and how embarrassed he felt. So, rather than going outside and yelling at Elliott Ralph went outside and he said, you know what? I did the same thing one day, let's figure out how we can fix it together and they did.

I'm gonna say he died, he died or ran away and the stepmother started treating her back. They treat her like like a servant. She would have to like take them things they would call and she would just have to answer to them.

I wish I could live in the palace. I guess, and the guy came in and he was, I wanna say, I guess inviting them somewhere because the lady, the stepmother had like a little script and was the daughters were surrounding them and they look happy.

And so I guess Cinderella got invited too because she started looking for a dress and she got a pink dress and when she was on her way out, I guess the sisters ripped her necklace off, I guess they were being mean or she had because she was pretty or something.

I'm thinking that was, and she met someone like she, she had a wand and she got dressed up and went to the party and she got there and, and started dancing with some guy.

She was there with the prince and in the background on the clock was midnight so that she had had a curfew and tried to run home, put her on her way, running down the stairs. She lost her shoe and she didn't notice or was so to turn around. But she kept running and got to the house and the little mice were there with the key. I guess the letter in before anyone noticed, um, the garden house did she get yelled at? I don't think she got yelled at. I'm not sure I forgot. But, um, in the end, like the guy, one guy was looking for the person who lost her shoe and her sisters were trying to get on but it didn't fit their feet.

So now moving on to something a little bit different if I've never made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tell me how you would make them. I would first, I'd go into my pantry and I get some bread and I take the bread and I put it on the counter and I get the peanut butter out of the, the pantry also. And I get the jelly out of the refrigerator and I would first spread the jelly because I wouldn't want the peanut butter to get into the jelly if I spread the peanut butter first and then I would spread the jelly on one side and I'd wipe it off by spreading whatever's left over on the other side. And then I'd spread the peanut butter. Very nice and neatly on the other side. And I put it together and, um, probably put it on a paper towel and bring it over here and eat it at the table. Thank you. Ok. So now I'm gonna show you, um, another, uh, pictures, these pictures also tell me, tell a story. Um take a look at them and then I'm gonna have you tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end and you can look at these pictures as you tell the story. It's the same as the other one. Ok? Go ahead. Um So looks like the little boy is refusing an umbrella. So mom said it looks like the mom's like you need to take an umbrella because it's gonna rain today. He said, forget it. Mom, he gets outside and realizes that his mother was right. So he runs back in and he's not too happy to it. Mother admit his mother's right, but reluctantly takes the umbrella and uh goes about his way. Ok, thank you. So now here is another story. Um Look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Ok? Looks like a cat ran up a tree. A little girl realized that it was her cat. She yelled to her dad to go rescue the cat. So the dad gets out the ladder, he climbs up the tree and when he gets to the top, the ladder falls. And as a result, the dog who loves the dad starts barking very loudly and alerts neighbors who call firemen who come and rescue the father. And ultimately the cat"}, {"segment_name": "wright47a_2750_225515.wav", "aws_transcription": "You take out uh if I was to make it uh uh I like uh peanut butter butter and jelly on white bread.

And then if I'm really hungry, I put a second layer and make it a double decker. Uh It's little Jonathan's seventh birthday and he's having a birthday party. He's invited his friends and his friend's parents over um for to open presents and have cake. And um right before everyone is supposed to arrive, um the dog smells the delicious cake on the table and jumps up on the table starts to eat the cake. And Jonathan comes in and finds the dog eating the cake and begins to cry. And the mom gets uh really angry and grabs a broom to punish the dog. And the dog sees the mom with the broom gets scared. Runs under the couch trailing icing on the carpet after him and all the screaming and crying going on. The birthday guests arrive at the door and they open the door to see what's going on and they come in the living room and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere and they wonder if there's still gonna be a party or not. You probably laugh because it's kind of a unique story. Um I once owned two black tailed prairie dogs and we uh some friends of ours liked uh our prey dogs so much that two separate friends of ours each bought a pair of pray dogs. We had six prairie dogs among the three groups of us. Anyway, one of them was going out of the country and needed us to watch their, their prairie dogs. And so, um, we did and one of them was a male and he was a little aggressive and he didn't like me very much. And so I was trying to kind of call him, pet him. Tina could pet him. My girlfriend could pet him, no problem, but he didn't like me very much. And so I was trying to pet him and I was rubbing his chin and he was getting all bristled up and I really didn't read the warning sign very much and he bit me and took out a good chunk of my middle finger. I opened up a so, uh so I'm actually home alone and I look down and I can see, you know, some of the bone and the fat and my finger, it's a pretty good bite. And I realized, well, I should probably not, um, I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it. And I don't always do well with sight of my own blood. Like I have no problem around other people, but I got all white faced and had to sit down for a while and I'm like, oh boy, what do I do? So ironically or funny that Tino is actually swimming at a su at the pool here. So I had to wrap my finger and drive just a mile or two down to a su and interrupt her class and to get her to drive me uh to the urgent care at the hospital for stitches. And uh so I was standing there when she came up out of the pool. You know, I'm standing there, I'm like um the dog bit me. Can you drive me to the urgent care?

Soon she heard that there was going to be a wonderful ball occurring at the castle which made her very excited. You need to go to it. Um Stepmother knew that the ball was gonna be hosted by prince because they wanted to a better chance in life. They wanted to see if one of the daughters would marry into money so that they can get more money. Um So she was preparing her daughters as well to be ladies to be able to go to the ball. When Cinderella asked to see if she can go to the ball and stay inside, they were like fine, but you would have to do all these chores that could not be in time. So as um she continued to work hard to try to make her her step and her sisters were able to go and make sure that they gave her more work before she left sad because of the fact that she could not go. She made a wish. And as she made a wish, a fairy godmother appeared to answer her plea. Um But there was conditions for favorite, but she can go enjoy her night, but had to return at a certain time for like she was able to go to the ball with all the magic that was bestowed brought to her on that occasion, she was able to meet the prince.

Um as she was leaving, she accidentally left her shoe and she was trying to leave before anybody were to see her change. She got barely home, but she changed. She was still happy at the experiences that she had. Stepmother came home, saw, thought, knew who that she had, was able to go and saw that it was dangerous that the prince was able, did like her war and her stepsisters made sure when she heard that royalty were coming, that she would not be seen somehow she was able to escape so that she would be able to prove that she was the mysterious girl that they needed for the ball that the prince met. And when she put on the shoe, they found it was her. And so he was happy she was able to get out of her. All right. Excellent. And then last for this first test, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. So how you like that? Um, you go to a store, you buy bread, peanut butter and jelly. Um, they're two separate items, bread, peanut butter and jelly. Depending on which one you like. Some people like strawberry, some people like grape, go home and you take two slices of bread. On one side, you would take a butter knife, grab the measure a peanut butter slided on one side.

Ok? Uh They, the mother of one little boy had decided to have a birthday party for his fourth birthday. Um They took the, the boy and his two friends and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day and were planning to come back home to celebrate later in order to prepare for the party, the mother had baked a three layer cake and was really excited that the boy would like it. However, when they came home from the park, they found a bad surprise. The dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house. So when they got home, the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with a broom. Um You're not gonna believe me. But anyway, two weeks ago, I was Saturday night, two weeks ago, on a Saturday evening, about 6 p.m. I started feeling a stomachache, I thought, or like a side stitch. Ironically enough, the pain started to travel down my back. I could feel it moving. It wasn't a muscle. I couldn't, I, I'm much sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle, it wasn't a bone. Something was really weird and it was moving. They were kidney stones eventually I found out. But I remember thinking, I don't have yet insurance here and I've just moved back and I haven't been to a hospital here in 20 years. This is going to be really horrible. And I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where I had a fever of 100 and one or something and it just was doubled over and couldn't even really stand. Um, as the thing was making its way down. So we went to the hospital and the first thing I walked in, as I said, I'm sorry to bring you a bad news. And the woman said, why did my husband die? That's the receptionist. And I said, that's a good joke. But anyway, I don't have insurance and she said that's no problem. That's, you're gonna get it. I'm on hand and I remember thinking, ok, this is gonna be all right. Three hours later, we're after some medicine and vomiting at least 40 times because of the intense pain. The most intense pain I've ever had in my life. Just imagine like stones going through that little opening, sorry. And, uh, suddenly, and I was having this little strainer thing and seeing them come out and, oh, and then for about a day of the blood and everything else, um, but I was amazed the body and how, and once, once they told me what it was, I read a little bit about it and realized it's not such a simple thing and how often we don't realize it. So water, people drink cola and coffees, cola bubble gas drinks are the worst. And then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested. So I learned and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasn't even vomit. I thought my my throat is going to come out because of the convulsions were so strong. And I just remember thinking my wife and son are coming next week and oh my God, here I am in the hospital. So I was really, I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it for the first time in my life. Ever, not death.

All right, we have a, a boy probably in his backyard playing soccer, practicing and he kicks the soccer ball and it goes through a window. We don't know if it's his home or his neighbor's home, but it goes to the window breaks. The glass and not only does it break the glass, it knocks over a lamp probably breaks it too. Um, and there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and plant falling over and he gets up and goes to the window, holding the mall and that's all I can see.

He took mother's advice and has the umbrella. Thank you. So here is a picture which you have definitely seen. I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and then tell me the story. Ok? Um In this picture, it appears that we have a cat that the dog chased up the tree because the dog is still barking and the cat is out on a limb and there's a little girl trying, holding her arms up, hoping to catch the cat. Her tricycle is in front of her and there's a ladder on the ground and dad, apparently dad is up the tree and I am guessing that dad got a ladder and climbed up the tree to try to get the cat and the dog probably knocked the ladder down, but that's not for sure, but the ladder got knocked down. So now we have cat and dog or cat and dad stuck in the tree and someone has called the fire department. There's a fire truck parked out on the street and we have two firemen running towards the tree with a ladder to resolve everything.

I don't remember, but he was going to overpower me and I could sense that. And so I said, I repeated the same words to him. Yeah. And he said uh oh, you're gonna get in so much trouble. And he screamed, Mom Mary just said the dirtiest word in the whole. Uh So that's my story. Oh And then you know, he continued to be, he started to become like he just, I became like his picking point uh for walking home, he'd throw things at me and just he was a bully, not a terrible bully, but a bully. I was scared of him. Uh And he was on my walk home back when the kids used to walk to school. But anyway, and so once again, um these pictures tell a little a a story.

But Cinderella had her other, the other glass slipper and came out and uh the the mice she was put in Cinderella was uh actually locked up, but her animal friends were able to get her the key and unlocked the door. So she was able to show the princess assistant that the glass slipper did indeed fit her and she was the one that was wearing the slippers at the, at the ball. And the prince and Cinderella lived happily ever after then. Good. The family's kitty cat apparently climbed up the tree. The little girl is calling for the cat to come down. But no luck, the dog is barking at the base of the tree to either try to get the cat down. But the dad coming to the rescue climbs up there, but apparently he gets stuck in the tree and can't come, can't get the cat nor make his way back down. So the firemen were called and they were coming to his re he and the cat's rescue by bringing a ladder to climb up on the tree and get them both."}, {"segment_name": "wright48a_341923_559801.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. Um, during my childhood. Yes. Ok. So I have one. I grew up in New York the first part of my life. And so in New York it was like, you know, you don't trust anybody. You don't go with any strangers. You know, everybody's bad. In New York we had the completely different view of California. California was like this fantasy land, you know, awesome place to be. You can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody. So when we moved here, when we moved to California from New York, I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you. And one time this, um, man stopped and he was like, do you need a ride? And I was, it was one of those days where it was, the evening was coming and the bats were like, flying around and I was like, oh my gosh, I was so scared. Am I gonna make it home? These bats are so it was like a Godsend when he stopped, you know, I was like, oh, ok. And get all right. And I have to deal with these bats. And I'm thinking, well, every and everybody in, well, I'm in California. So a person can't possibly do me wrong. So I get in the car and I'm driving and it's like, how are you? And you know, what's your name? And where do you live? And, um, then it's, then it just started getting weird when I said, make a right and he said, well, I'm gonna make a left and they're like, no, go right. And then that's when I was like, ok, something's wrong here. And, um, so I just prayed at that point like that he would go right, go towards my house. And, um, he's like, are you sure you don't want something to drink? You know, I'm like, no, just please just go right. And so he turned right and then I said, here's my street, please turn and, um, I, um, anything, I didn't know what was gonna happen at that point, he pulled up in front of my house and he was still kind of rolling and I just kind of opened the door and just kind of jumped out of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house and nobody was home. So that I'm knocking on the door and the sun's going down and I'm like, oh, gosh, what if he's like, just still right there waiting for me? And so when I thought he was gone, I ran over to my neighbor's house, which is my, you know, my best friend's house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home. Flooding began in Arizona this past weekend. And, um, it flooded one of the, um, one of the streets and, um, one of the washes over flooded and, um, a little girl was playing in the park where one of the washes are and she, um, got pulled into the current, um, she started yelling for help and they called the local, I don't know, fire department and they came and with all their gear and, uh, tried to figure out how they could get to her. And, um, one of the firemen was able to jump into the water and grab onto a branch and pull the girl to safety."}, {"segment_name": "MSUC05b_687558_905332.wav", "aws_transcription": "Uh once upon a time in a land far away, there was a little girl named Cinderella and she was brought to the home of a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her. And she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters. But as it turned out, the sisters were not very nice and neither was the the mom, her stepmom and they actually put her to work and she had to do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose. Um But Cinderella was happy nonetheless and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the birds and such. And she was a very kindred spirit in that Cinderella. And um she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom, they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride and they invited all the eligible women from the kingdom. And in her heart, she thought, oh, I would just love to go to that ball. And uh she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of course, she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella and uh but the step sisters were going to go and she had to help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball. And Cinderella was sad. She went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said we'll help you Cinderella and they brought out some ribbon and some, some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her. And um she had the dress but she had no way of getting to the ball. And she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared and it was her fairy godmother and her fair, my fairy godmother said, don't cry, my child. I know you want to go to the ball and, and I can help you just fetch me a pumpkin and I'll turn it into a coach and your mice friends will be the coachman. And so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the, the coachman and off, she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world. And when she got there, she approached the ball and looked down the stairs and there everyone was dancing and they saw her come in and they turned and looked at her and the prince looked and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman that he had ever seen. He invited her to dance and they just had a nice connection and she uh engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing. And um, suddenly the time had gone by and it was midnight and she had been warned by her very godmother that the magic would end at midnight. So quick, she ran from the castle and in doing so, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper and she found her way home and um the prince retrieved the slipper and was determined to find the fair maiden who left it there. So he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them. And everyone tried on the slipper. And when he came to the house of the where Cinderella and her step sisters lived, the steps sisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper and uh it didn't quite work, but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in a room upstairs and the mice gave her the key and she got out and she came down and she said she'd like to try on the slipper. And with that, she tried on the slipper and her fairy got her um, step wicked stepmother. And her sisters were amazed that she could have been that beautiful person that night. But as it was, they, she tried on the slipper, he knew she was the princess that he wanted and they got married and they lived happily ever after. I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL11-2_25608_243221.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok, we'll just take, not be redundant. I'll talk about something else. I did think of another surgery that I had when I was younger was a, when I was a teenager getting my wisdom teeth taken out. And I think a lot of people probably have had that, that done as a, I'm telling you, my dog does this every time I know that messes up the transcriptions. Don't worry. Sorry. But anyway, what, so when I was 16, I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again, I'd never really had to have any, any anesthesia or anything like that. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course, it was an outpatient situation, but since a lot of my friends had, had it done before, I kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then because I know now people videotape people coming out of the anesthesia. But, uh, I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I'd never had anesthesia before. So it was um kind of interesting and I just remember being, having the cotton all in my mouth when, when I was trying to talk and, uh, it was rather painful. I remember that too. And then having just, it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had. Um, I know from last week that you do, in fact have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. Um So again, just share what problems that you've experienced um, with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help. Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research, it's been really interesting to me having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on uh a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has aphasia. I'm, I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this, but I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate. Uh Make sure that I ask questions, ask, yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman who is actually in, in Mexico, they went on a trip to Mexico um before the quarantine and they actually kind of got stuck down there because they don't want to put her on a plane. And um, so anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit and we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So it was, it was a challenge to help because she did have some, some probably moderate aphasia. Her son was on the phone too. So I was on the speaker phone. So just that whole thing of really slowing everything down, asking her questions several times and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that was definitely, definitely makes you think about all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have aphasia. And I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one on one communication with folks. Um, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life could be happy or sad? Um, from when you were a child or more recently again, you can tell the same story as last week or you can choose a different story, a different story. I have lots of stories. I think all speech pathologists have lots of stories.

We say it is and he gets up and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out to the whole of the broken window and he sees the boy and we don't have any more pictures here. But I think the little boy says, oh, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry and it will, we'll assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry, sir, that I broke your window, but I will work for you to try to replace it. And so that's what he did. So again, these panels of pictures tell a story. Um take a second to look them over. They go left to right and then bottom and then left to right again. Um Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see with a beginning, a middle and an end, the little boy has his backpack on and he's getting ready to go to school and his mom says it's raining outside or it's going to rain and you better take an umbrella and he says, no, look, the sky is completely clear. I don't want to take an umbrella but I think you better, the weather, weather report says it's going to rain but he won't do it. And so she said, all right, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school and sure enough, pretty soon it starts raining, drip, drip, drip. And it, then he, he keeps on, he, he starts to continue, but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now. And he's really upset and he runs back home drip, drip, drip on the kitchen floor. And his mother says, I told you and he said, well, you are right. I do need an umbrella. So this time he was willing to take the umbrella, he put it up and off. He went in the rain on his way to school. All right. So this first picture, um, tells a story, take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story, you see with a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat. And one day the dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree and there the cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see from the picture the dog is still barking. So of course, the cat isn't going to come down and she probably cried and cried. And finally her father came out and what's the matter kitty cat is up in the tree? And the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat. And so he did, but the dog is still barking. It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage, but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get, but he can't get as far out as the cat is. If he did, he would surely break the limb and he would fall. So as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody, maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening and she called the fire department. And so here comes the fire department, they are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree, but the dog is no longer barking. So the cat jumps down the end."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto53a_408899_624940.wav", "aws_transcription": "He, he has a, um, it's female who, uh, had the same ailment that he had.

Can you move your leg? Can you do this? That or the other thing? And their attitude was a very nice thing.

He sustained a severe horrible head injury called the ambulance. We got him to a Methodist Hospital where in the middle of the night he had three hours of skull surgery and the surgeon told us afterwards, well, I fixed his skull but I cannot fix his brain. So after that, he was one month in Methodist Hospital in the traumatic brain injury area. And then he was discharged and he went to a community rehabilitation hospital for another month for both speech and physical and occupational therapy. After that, he was sent to a sub acute rehab place called Hamilton Trace where he spent the next three months, then he came home to our house and we set up a hospital bed for him here in our living room. And then he had um uh speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy and a nurse who came to see us in our home. And that occupied just about every morning of, of the week and that went on during the summer. And then they decided they'd done what they could for him. And then we, then we signed him up for rehabilitation services at community um outpatient uh places, one place and he went there, think it was three times a week for 2 to 3 hours at a time. And that lasted until pretty much the end of the year when they gently said, we think it would be good if you would take a little vacation from us now. And what they really meant was we've done all we can for you. Goodbye. But we also got TED signed up with a place called Neuro Hope and Neuro Hope offered physical therapy, but not the other two modalities. And so he has been a patient at Neuro Hope ever since. And I cannot say that he has made much of any progress in any of those areas. His speech is still limited to. Yeah. No. And once in a while, I don't know, but I have learned pretty much to tell what he wants even without language. We have tried Scrabble tiles and if I yesterday, for example, I asked him what kind of sandwich do you want?

So I need to go back to school and I'm gonna have to let my teacher know that she was right. I need that umbrella so that I don't ruin the school's tablet. So he went back and that's what he did.

Um Cinderella um in this book evidently opens up a chest and finds a ball gown and maybe a diary or something of her mother. So I don't remember that as being part of the story as I would call it, but that's what seems to be in the book uh and puts out the ball gown to plan to go. But when she gets stressed, everybody rejects the idea that she could go and she stays home. Um, the uh her godmother arrives and arranges for her to go. Um, and uh, um, gets an even more beautiful dress for her to, to wear stories. I remember always had the carriage that was generated from a pumpkin that she goes in. I don't even remember seeing that in the book. Um, she goes to the ball. She's makes a hit with a prince. Uh but she has to leave at midnight. She's got the instruction to leave at midnight. Otherwise she will return to the clothes she was wearing before she got the ball dress and the carriage will turn into a pumpkin and she races out of the ball before trying to get home before midnight and loses a shoe and, and the glass slipper in the course of the process. Um uh uh the princess left having no idea where to find this young woman that he's become entranced with and he has only the shoe and they put out a proclamation that the shoe should be taken throughout the kingdom until they find what it fits.

Um So Cinderella hears her and likes goodbye and then she travels to the ball where she meets the prince um and dance with him. He, they sort of have the love at first sight kind of thing going on.

And so she rushes away but in her haste to get a to run away for the spell, um elapses, she loses a glass slipper um, and the prince picks it up and he doesn't, he says something like, what's your name? Where will you go? How will I find you? And she runs away? And so, um she had a wonderful time at the ball and, you know, Cinderella is actually pretty ready lived to, is ready to live, pretty content on the fact that she had a really nice night and life sort of goes back to the way it was except for the prince is looking for her because he loves her.

And um by the time the messenger arrives at their home, uh the step sisters and Lady Tma have actually realized that the king is seeking out this mysterious girl that he met at the ball. And um Lady Tremaine actually puts together that Cinderella was at the ball because Cinderella is singing a song and dancing and is happy.

But although they try to deceive them into thinking that it does, but really their feet are too much, too big. And um the animals meanwhile, steal the key from Lady Tremaine pocket, take it all the way up the stairs and unlock the door. So Cinderella comes out just in the nick of time and the messenger is happy to see her and Cinderella is like, I'll try on the glass slipper and Lady Tma trips in and the glass slipper breaks and the advisor is really upset because she thinks the king is gonna be mad.

They couldn't believe how incredible she looked. Uh But what she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having, she tried to remember one thing that their fairy godmother had told her, she said she needed to be back by midnight. She says if she wasn't back by midnight, the pumpkin was gonna turn back in or the carriage was gonna turn back into a pumpkin and that the horses were gonna turn back into mice and that the uh chauffeur chauffeur was gonna turn back into the dog. So Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself. Until then she was having so much fun. She lost track of the time when she looked up at the clock, she noticed that it was almost 12 o'clock. And while she was dancing with the prince, she quickly broke away from him and says, I gotta go, I gotta go. And she's, and the prince says, no, you can't go. I think I found my true love. Cinderella continued to run. I got to go. I must go. And as Cinderella was running out, she left the shoe behind. She hesitated for a second to get it but realized she didn't have enough time. So she quickly hopped into the carriage, the carriage drove, drove off and uh got her home just in time. Clothes turned the rags, the carriage turned into a pumpkin, the horse turned into mice and the chauffeur turned into the dog uh back at the palace, the prince uh while he was chasing, Cinderella noticed that there was a glass slipper that was still there. So he picked up the glass slipper and said, I must find this woman whosever foot can, whosever woman's foot can fit into this shoe. That's the person that I'm going to marry. So, so the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit at you one house after another. Uh None of the female's foot would fit into the glass slipper. Uh And so finally he came to Cinderella's house. As the prince arrived, the mother and the evil stepsisters, they locked Cinderella into the closet uh where she couldn't get out.

So uh the prince asked her to try on the shoe and she did and magically, you know, she transformed back into the lady that he saw that night.

Um But she is uh rescued by her fairy godmother who creates a dress for her and uh changes a pumpkin into a carriage and I think the mice are the ones that become the footmen.

But what I came to find out about her was that she was Jewish. I am Christian. She was in a concentration camp in Germany. And thank goodness she managed to make it through and she was on one of the first boats out to this country because she had relatives who had come over generations earlier in, in Chicago. And she ended up in Paducah, Kentucky. And we liked each other so very much that we became Scott troop leaders together. And in the process of all of this, of all the planning, we spent a lot of time together. And she told me much about her life in Germany and about the terrible, terrible times of the Holocaust. And one of the things that I remember vividly, the only reason that she really lasted, her mother was gentile. Her father was Jewish and the line goes through the mothers if you probably know this, uh the Jewish Jewish line goes through the mothers. And because of this, her, her uncle, this merciless uncle was her mother's brother and he was, of course gentile and he was the police officer in the town where she lived. So he was able to keep her off the list of the Children who were going off to the concentration camps. But finally, at the end, he couldn't do it anymore. And she told me one time, which just broke my heart, he sent her and her three siblings off to concentration camp and, but he would not look at them, her and, and her mother, the mother and the father managed to stay in Dresden and they were both killed in the fire bombing in Dresden just before the war was over. But probably that was one of the most and it was second hand to me, it was all, it was not something that happened to me, but it was something that I became very much involved in because I listened to her stories and she didn't just tell me the story. It was things she just told me little by little. And finally in the village where she grew up, they were going to, they, they asked her to come back, they wanted her to come back, they paid her would pay her, you know, to get her to come. They, they wanted, they wanted some closure for them too because it's a, it was a terrible time and she wouldn't go and she wouldn't go.

So there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father apparently died, she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters and they used to make her clean and they used to make her cook and they were very mean to her and they made her live in the attic and they made her wear old ugly clothes. She was very, very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative. And she befriended all the animals in the house, the mice and the birds. And when she looked out the window every day, she used to see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father, the king and queen of land. And so she used to dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown. She never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear. And they always said to her, you'll never go to the ball, you'll never go to the palace. So one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big, very big dance because the king was sick and tired of his son not getting married. Seriously. All the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men.

So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella and she was so surprised and so excited. Then she went to the ball and at the ball, she met the prince and it was just love at her sight the way it should be. He loved her and she loved him. And they had a wonderful time dancing and then her sister saw her and were very, very upset that she was there and they were pulling her dress and they were tearing her skirt and they chased her away and made her go home.

And I said, well, right, if you are sure, well, it took all night long and Rick was on one side of her bed and I was on the other side and we just had the most delightful evening. Pam wasn't enjoying it all that much. What Rick and I were, and when the baby really started to come and the doctor was there and of course, I was still there and Rick was still there and I wanted it to be a girl. I was an only girl. My daughter was my first child and she was a girl and we're all named for my father. We carried his family name down and I wanted this one, the first grandchild to be a girl. So I could have the name carried down again and had an ultrasound. And they told him this boy and she was so afraid I was going to be disappointed and I was looking and looking and trying to see. And finally the doctor looked up at me and he said, grandmother, if you move back, just a little bit, I might be able to catch this baby when it comes out. So we laughed and he did catch the baby. But when it came out, it was my girl wasn't a boy. They made a mistake on the ultrasound. And well, my name is Evelyn Brewer Smith. Pamela is Pamela Brewer Smith Foster. And that baby is Rachel Brewer Foster. So I, that was, that was my and to be there and to actually see her born and course the doctor gave her to Rick first and then Rick gave her to me. And so I laughingly say I always love my son-in-law but never quite as much as I did that night. He really became mine that night.

What, how it started is that a cat? This little girl's cat right up into her tree, right up into the tree? Um, she was riding along, riding her bicycle and I guess the cat was playing with her and the cat goes up into the tree, um, is not willing to come down. So this man will say if her dad decides to help her out and to climb up into the tree to rescue the kitty cat, um, then this dog decides he's not happy about that. Um And so it's either barking at some combination of the bird, the man and the cat, um, has somebody tree, I don't know that he really cares to. Um, there's, I guess the dog has probably also knocked this ladder over that the man used to climb up into the tree. Um And then because now everybody is stuck in the tree. The fire department has been called for them to come and rescue to help the little girl get her cat out of the tree and then to help the man get out of the tree without getting attacked by this dog. Um And this little bird is just over here not really giving a care about anything and is just enjoying the whole scene. So we will assume that all of this worked out nicely and everybody came down safe and sound, the cat is rescued. The man is no longer afraid and the firemen have sufficiently done their duty. Thanks.

Then he, he denies that he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to use it. Um leaves for school without it. Uh As he's walking to school, it starts to rain.

So two more stories with this one and then another story if it doesn't have pictures. Ok. Ok. Um, so in this one, there is a guy kicking a soccer ball, um, just playing in his yard eventually or as he's playing, kicks it a little too hard and knocks it into ups it through a window in a house. Um, as when he goes through the window, it knocks over a lamp and sees the guy sitting on the couch.

But I used to run 35 40 miles a week. So I'm used to running. But a couple of years ago I was just running across the little grassy field and I started to speed up because it had started to rain. And as I was running, I got this sudden pain in my left leg and I had to like walk and walk with a little bit of pain back to the car. So when I got home, I put some ice on my knee, didn't think a whole lot of it till the next couple of days. And what would happen then was that I would get excruciating pain at times when I would attempt to put my left foot down onto the ground and the pain would only be gone as I lift my leg off of the ground. I had no idea what was causing this, but the pain was so severe. I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer. But in this case, you know, you hit it with a hammer and it's gone. As long as I stood on that knee, that intense pain would be. So I finally went to an orthopedic doctor and after taking x rays and an MRI they found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot handle tear where the femur had actually gone through and the meniscus was still totally intact, but it looked like a teapot where you have that slender handle above the top of it. And he said, well, that's going to continue to do that to your femur unless we go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery and you know, you, you plan these surgeries and unfortunately, things don't always go real well. I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day. I think this day it was 1 p.m. So I got there, you had to go there an hour or so ahead of time. I ended up having it done at ST Joe's Hospital even though I was going to be an, an outpatient. And I went in there and they, you know, clean your bag up and everything. And it turns out though that this particular set of surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up. So my appointment at one in the afternoon actually took place at six in the afternoon and they finally wheeled me into the room, not having any idea what they were going to do. I'm pulled into the room and they put me off of the one bed onto the room. Thank you. Uh, I, I feel these doctors like grabbing my leg and slamming it up against this rubber, uh, mount to the left of my leg. And, uh, I knew that they were going to do arthroscopic surgery, but I had not had any inkling on how this would all happen. In fact, I thought it might have been so simple.

As when Mommy and Johnny stepped out of the kitchen, they walked back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken chunk. There was a big bite taken out of the cake and they looked to see that the prince led right to the dog under the couch. Mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrive and Johnny cried the guest, the guest walked in, they said, oh my, what are we going to do now? But the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything. So the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home in fourth grade. I was outside, um, during recess in New York and as you may or may not know they have, um, we play in the streets in the public schools anyway, in the inner city we don't have a playground so they put up the barriers and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street. So, um, I was standing against one of the cars and a friend of mine ran right into me and uh my wrist went right around the um the rear view mirror and broke. So, um they called my mom and my mom came and I was just crying and she rushed me to the doctor. Um we took, I think we took the bus because she didn't want to pay for an ambulance. So I'm in pain on the bus, I'm crying, I'm trying to keep it still and um got to the hospital and they had to put a cast on me and that was my first time having a cast and um got back to school and all my friends signed it. And um, so that was cool. And then the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside. And so I remember one time my mom used like a one of the straws from the broom to try and itch and it broke in there. So then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to, to it. Um, and that was about all I remember about that. And I, oh, and then I remember using it as a weapon too. If somebody bothered me, I'd hit them with it, but then I would feel it too.

So I guess the standard, the standard story would be the cat climbed into the tree and really wasn't having any problems. But the girl who was really concerned that the cat is trapped in the tree and to end up being a cat skeleton up there in a few days. So she got her dad and her dad climbed up on the tree and uh couldn't really quite get out as far as cat. Meanwhile, the dog knocked over the ladder that dad used to climb up the tree and his kind of angry with dad.

Uh, well, this is not good. Uh, and this was in high school and back then, uh, uh, they had to go to a school nurse first or anything. And so then she took a look at it and obviously sent me to the school doctor. Doctor said it, it was just, it wasn't broken, it was just dislocated and he just pulled it out and push it back together and put a big splint on it fine. And two weeks whenever going by and I go to the doctor, uh, and the doctor said, well, now we have, we have to start bending this finger because otherwise it will get stiff. So I stick my hand out there and he bends it and I'm going through the roof. I mean, this is, this is not a good thing, you know. Oh, come on. He says, come on, this is, this can't be hurting that much, you know. Uh, oh, we gotta bend it one more time, one more time. I stick my hand out there and, and he's going nuts because he's mad because, I mean, this is hurting but he's, he's not having that. So he puts back on and said, we'll come back in a week and we'll look at it again. Will you clear? Come back? And he said, well, we gotta be your finger. Stick it out there. No, not doing it one more time. I said, I, I'm not sticking my finger out there again. We're not bending a finger anymore and he just threw all the stuff down and discussed and said, well, get out of here and fine. So by now, no, I, I, I'm at the University of Iowa. So I go to student health over there and they sent me to the, uh, orthopedic, you know, group there and, and they determined, well, there's nothing they can do. The bones are laying side by side. They've been laying side by side for so long that all they can do is cut the knuckle out and pin it back together. So they have a little shorter finger and they put a little curve in it and as it turned out. I believe it would have been a lot better if I just had them cut it off. Uh, because when you make a little, I can't bend that finger so you don't have a lot of strength in that finger either. I think if they had cut that off, I'd have had a lot more strength and it's just favoring that finger so much over the years. I think that's what's causing my writing process.

So that's another way that an out can be generated. Um, let's see, um, the way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from 1st, 2nd, 3rd and then touches back on to home plate, that's one point or one run. Um, I mentioned that there's a field beyond the diamond, there's usually a fence behind that, those, those players that are in the outfield, it's called the outfield. Um, if the batter hits the ball over that outer fence, then it's a home run. And so he gets a free unimpeded trip around from each base and that's a point if the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around and he scores a point and then the batters gets a point. So it's a two run home run. So you, um, you try to get more points or runs before you are all of your 27 outs are exhausted. Um, if you are taught, if the both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning, then it's a kind of a sudden death like whoever gets the most runs where both teams equally have a chance to score runs. Um, after that, um, they win the game. So if you, if you're tied in the ninth and then the visiting team comes up first because they start the, the game, they start batting, they score a run. They get, then they get three outs. The other team doesn't score, they get their chance, they get three outs with no runs, then the visiting team has won the game. There's no time the, the games can conceivably last forever. Um The, the, the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points. Um, some of the strategies that people employ are, um, you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball and there's different types of pitchers. There's some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow. Um, and then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So, because if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm, can throw the ball to first base and before that batter gets there, then they're, they're, they're valuable um, for the offensive team. Um, some skills that you want is you want someone that is strong that has really good hand eye coordination and uh that, that can hit the ball far and hard. Um, some specialized players are there, they're skilled at speed. So if you have someone that is marginal hitting, but he's fast, um and they can hit the ball and, but they're fast the first base and can get there before the other team is, um, he is able to get the ball and then it, and then, um that's a valuable, valuable position as well.

But the fairy godmother told her at the stroke of midnight, it all goes away. So just as it, it starts chiming midnight, she runs out the door, one of her, her glass slippers falls off and she runs off into the night. So now the prince is in love with this woman and all he has is this little glass slipper. And so the kingdom begins a, a search for the girl whose foot fits in the glass slipper. And so when they go to Cinderella's house, um the stepmother tries to sabotage it so they won't find out that the slipper belongs to Cinderella, but of course they do. And Cinderella and the prince look happily ever after. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally and she had a beloved cat named Fluffy and Fluffy got chased up in the tree by a dog that lived down the street. So her father came along and saw that she was quite upset and he got a ladder and he got it up and climbed up in the tree to get Fluffy down for a little Sally. But when he got up there, the ladder fell and now both Fluffy and dad were stuck in the tree. So they had to call the fire department and the fire department rushed out and saved dad and Fluffy.

It was, I'm sure the most important thing that ever happened. Um, the most memorable day was the day our son was born. But I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how, how interesting that all was. We were students at Mont Clare State and in those days, freshman still had to wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures. And in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus, we had to sing the, the alma mater. But the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at, at Life Hall and he noticed the sign and said something about, I think I had part of it was covered and he said, are you a speech major? And I said, no English and I un unveiled the, the words English, but he was a senior and I was a freshman. And so I got to meet one of the, you know, the upper class and got his signature. And then later, um, we just had, it was an easy conversation. We just, we talked a little, he, he continued, um, when I, whenever I saw him to say hi and, and people were telling me he's a BMOC. You know, he's a, he was a, a vice president of student government. And I said, oh, my goodness. But the more we had to talk about I was a student leader in my high school. And I thought when he, when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee, but it turned out that he was, he was interested. So our first date I think was the something like the Kingston Trio or something like that. Some folk group. It was really nice. They were on campus and Joe had probably arranged for them to come. That was one of his duties. But when I just think of how all that unfolded, just uh I knew I was going to finish school. And so we, we paced ourselves, I guess, you know, to, to be logical about things. Get to know each other, no surprises along the way because you have time with the person and you, you see them in all the seasons and all. But I think when it finally came to, to getting married, um I don't think there was a formal, we, people ask us, but this was not even a formal proposal. I think everyone around us assumed we would marry. So we did. And so I, I wasn't engaged. You know, we, I was pinned and someone said to me the next day, you know, you're, you're engaged to be engaged. I said, no, I'm not. And he said, well, that's what that means. And I said, oh, I thought it meant sort of going steady college style. They said, no, you're engaged to be engaged. And I said, wow, we have some time to go before I said it means what it means to the individual couple too. So I tried to assert myself, but I guess it might have been right.

So they send out invitations to around the town and the stepmother gets the invitation and all the girls are so excited to go to the ball and try and become the wife of the prince. So they get ready Cinderella has the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress and she gets dressed and comes down to go to the ball with them. But her sisters say no, she can't go. She has to stay and clean and they rip her dress. She goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball. Then the her fairy godmother appears and says she will create the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball. But she has to be back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin. So and she gets glass slippers. So she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her and her stepmother. And the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different. And then it gets to be midnight and she says, oh, I need to go home. So she runs away from the prince and in running away, she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs and she runs home and her dress turns back to rags and the coach turns back to the pumpkin, but she still has her glass slipper. Then the next day, the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was so they show up with a slipper at her house and the stepmother locks her in the room, locks Cinderella in the room and they try and fit the slipper on the step sister's feet, which it doesn't fit because they have big feet. And the mice steal the key and bring it into Cinderella so she can escape her room and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper and lo and behold it fits. So they bring her back to the prince and they get married and they live happily ever after."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto33a_493668_682758.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um, got out of the hospital.

They get you up, make you move a lot and you guys up the first day actually walking up and down the hall and then I was, I think I was in the hospital five days, went home to my daughters and, um, she made sure I got up at least three times more. If she could get me up, we walked up and down the sidewalk out in front. Um, and, um, anyway, after about a week I went home and, um, did very well. I healed fast and it, it went well and then, um, they sent me to an oncologist who, um, put me on chemo. He said that it's not good if you have a blood transfusion after surgery, they don't really know why in this kind of surgery. Um, but anyway, he put me on chemo. It was the pill form. And so he took chemo, I had to go see him every three months and he did a cat scan and, and blood work every three weeks. I mean, and, um, which is not too bad except that iodine really messes your system up that they couldn't and, uh, do what they call a contrast when they do the cat scan and, um, the chemo, um, there's on the pill form on this particular prescription, the major side effects. I didn't want nausea. That's, but it's, uh, mouth sores and your palms of your hands in the bottom of your feet blister. So I just told the oncologist I wasn't having any part of that. I didn't want it. He just kind of looked at me but I didn't have that. And, um, I think there's something called mind over matter and I just decided I went and, and deal with it. Uh, one of the big side effects of all chemotherapy is fatigue. And, um, another thing which is, I really didn't have that until like the last went to a family reunion in, in September and, uh, kind of wore me out but then the fatigue hit and once it hit it was really, really bad. And then I had, uh, I have a little arthritis anyway, but I had severe, um, joint pain and muscle ache. But all in all can't complain about that. It could have been much worse.

So she walked toward a tree, toward the sound of the bird singing and while she was there, she saw the cat and even though the cat is just sleeping she wanted to bring the cat down from the tree.

Um, once upon a time, there was a little boy, he was getting ready to go to school and his mother came and said, before you go to school, you need to take your umbrella because it's supposed to rain today. The way the man said it was supposed to rain. And the little boy said, I don't want to take an umbrella to school. None of the other kids take their umbrellas to school. And so, um, he finally talked her into, I don't want to take the umbrella and she finally said, ok, but if it rains, you're going to get wet. So I don't want to hear any complaints. So he makes it about halfway to school and guess what? It starts raining and then it starts raining. Even harder and he has to run back through the puddles and the rain to his house and he comes back and he is absolutely soaked from head to toe. And the mother says, well, and he said I should have listened to you, I should have taken the umbrella. So she dries him off. She gives him the umbrella and he heads back to school.

So there's, um, this sequence of pictures and I just want you to again look at the pictures that they tell a story and, um, tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So, uh, a young boy lived in the neighborhood and loved soccer and he was constantly kicking a soccer ball around his yard and down on the street and everywhere he went. And one day he was going down the sidewalk and he kicked the soccer ball and it bounced off the side of his foot right through the plate glass window of one of his neighbor's home. So his neighbor was sitting watching TV at his house and crashed. Here comes a soccer ball through the window. And so he was upset about it and he picks the ball up and he looks out the window and sees the boy and the boy is just very apologetic and says that he'll mow the man's lawn or clean his garage or clean his attic to make up for the cost of the broken window. And, uh, so the man said that he would just hold his ball until all that was done and the window was replaced and they made their deal and that was that right? Ok. Now, the last story that I want you to tell me, um, it's a little bit different. I just want you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. All right. Well, you, you start by removing two slices of bread from, uh, the, the loaf, lay them both flat face down, open, take, uh, a jar of peanut butter.

So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first, you need two slices of bread. Um and then a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly and a knife. So first you lay the two pieces of bread out and then you open the jar of peanut butter and using the knife, take some peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread of one slice of bread. And then you open the jar of jelly and you take the knife and you spread jelly on either on top of the peanut butter on the one slice or you could put it on the other slice but only on one side.

So let's see. Hm. All right. Well, there was a period of time when I was approximately 48 49 years old, when I began having a series of lung collapses and what a mysterious thing this was. But it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual period. And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor and I was sent to the, er, for x-rays for this lung collapse. And um, it was never complete. It was only about 15 to 20% of my, it was always my right lung. And so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse and I spent some time trying to figure out what on earth could this be? And finally I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm. And at the start of each menstrual period, I think it is bleeding, breaking and bleeding into my plural cavity because I have found 69 examples of or I have, I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation. And the doctor said, well, you might be right. We'll send you to a surgeon. So I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery. I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had, um, ectomy and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm. But instead he, um, cemented the top part of my right lung to the cavity that holds it in place. So that the next time I would have a bleed into this area, if that's what it was. In fact, my lung would not fall down and create a partial collapse. So that's what happened. Um After that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened, but I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end, the surgeon said, well, I guess that's, that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis that bled into the plural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of, of a type such that I would no longer have menstrual periods and it all turned out happily ever after I had no further lung collapses."}, {"segment_name": "richardson58_311895_496716.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok.

And, um, I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intravenous antibiotics, which I'd been on antibiotics for a long time and they did all kinds of tests. They couldn't find out what was wrong, but I was slowly dying and they knew that and that I was filled with infection and they couldn't locate it. And so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory and I agreed because I knew that I was not going to make it. And so they went in and what had happened, I had like peritonitis and um, it had diverticulitis and one of the worst and that would have been peritonitis with the infection. But my body being as wonderful as our bodies are, had tried to close it off and it had sealed it except for a little area that then it was leaking for several months. And so I was, I guess what they call septic. And so they did the surgery and it was a long, long surgery and I ended up with a colonoscopy, no colostomy, colostomy. It was the back. And, um, then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that.

I thought if that thing gets in the house or gets out, it can bite the kids and it might be rab rabid. Um, so I called the animal shelter. I think it was and they told me that they, everybody was on lunch and so they wouldn't be there for an hour, which I blew my stack and told them that I wanted someone there now because if someone gets bit, I will sue the city. So somebody came out and uh the uh men uh were not happy to see this possum either because he really looked mean and they took off the vent and somehow they caught him and then they discovered, I believe this is, they discovered a nest of baby possums which all looked very cute when they're babies.

And when they got to Cinderella's house, that was Cinderella's shoe and she got really excited. But um the evil stepmother locked her way so that she couldn't try on the shoe. However, somehow the duke found Cinderella, the shoe fit and then Cinderella, they took Cinderella to the castle and she married the prince and they lived happily ever after. All right. Great, sir. Ok. And then last for our stories, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before.

I really didn't know what the procedures were. And then, um, it went very smoothly and then just having a child and having it placed on my stomach. I mean, my husband and I, we were both just bawling because we couldn't believe we brought a baby into the world. So that for me was like a very life changing altering work of God. You know, it was a miracle. Here are some more pictures that tell a story, um, take a look at all of them. And again, I'd like you to tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Ok, one day, Billy was playing soccer in the yard and he kicked the soccer ball extremely hard and broke his neighbor's window with the ball, the ball landed on his neighbor's lap and the neighbor looked out the broken window to see who had kicked the ball. So here is a sequence of pictures that tell a story. Please look at all of the pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you may begin when ready. One day, a little boy was going out to play and his mother told him he needed to take an umbrella because it was going to rain that day. But the little boy said he was ok, he didn't need an umbrella because it wasn't raining at the present time. And he got on his walk to school and it started to rain and then it started to rain even harder. So he ran home, explained to his mom that he got caught in the rain and he picked up the umbrella and proceeded to walk to school. Ok. So for the first part, here is a picture, I'd like you to look at what's happening in the picture and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Go ahead and go. Are you ready for me? Sorry. Yes, you may begin. Ok. So there was a cat that got stuck in a tree and the little girl went to have her dad get the cat out of the tree and he climbed up the tree to retrieve the cat, he got stuck. And the mom who's not in the picture called the fire department to rescue both the dad and the cat up in the tree."}, {"segment_name": "richardson166_310055_485087.wav", "aws_transcription": "Um so it's just Cinderella and her dad and it looks like they have a dog and then um stepmother with her two daughters show up and they, they happen to have a cat. And so mhm. So then they all moved in to live together and Cinderella tries to befriend the cat and she, she has to kind of serve her sisters because they're kind of lazy. I don't really know but she does everything for them and, and then it doesn't really show that in the book, but her dad does, I guess then um so a letter comes and it's about going to the ball. I think before that Cinderella was dreaming about the castle in the far off distance and then the letter comes and it's about going to the ball to get to dance with the prince and maybe find him a wife. And so Cinderella starts making herself a dress and she uses a book and she gets it all together and then they get ready to go to the ball and her stepsisters out of jealousy, destroy her dress while her stepmother looks on very proudly about what's happening. And so then her stepsisters head off to the ball and the fairy godmother comes and she makes all these wonderful things happen for Cinderella. And Cinderella gets to go to the ball and she gets to dance with Prince Charming as her stepsisters watch obviously. And then she has to leave the ball in a hurry because she has to be home by midnight and she loses her little glass slipper in the process. And the princess, I'm not really sure what he is, but he comes around with the glass slipper. Well, actually I think she gets locked up and then her little mice friends give her a key to let her out. But while that's happening, the little man comes with the slipper and the stepmother is like, there's no one here and somehow she gets out with her little key from the mice and she ends up with pretty strong. I'm very excellent. And last, but not least this first test I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Ok, we're gonna need peanut butter and jelly, a knife or a spoon. And then you may want a paper towel or a plate or something. And then you're gonna need some bread, I guess, like a two slice peanut butter and chili sandwich. So you have two slices of bread and you'll take your knife or your spoon and you'll get some peanut butter and you'll spread it on the slice and then with your other slice of bread, you'll use your knife or your spoon, whichever you prefer, you'll spread some jelly on it and then you'll put the two slices to get."}, {"segment_name": "wright73a_730_175685.wav", "aws_transcription": "Now, here's a little girl and she has her tricycle and she's holding her hands up to a tree on the limb of the tree is a little cat. It's her cat and she's begging the cat to come down. But the cat's holding on to that limb. But then her father must have come to see if he could help and he had a ladder, but he didn't take the ladder. He just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch, but he's stuck there now because he can't get to him. Otherwise that branch will break and then he'll hurt himself. In the meantime, the little girl's dog comes and he's barking and barking. What are you doing up there? Come on down. I can't come up there. Another bird is taking this all in but he's singing. He's on another branch on the opposite side and he's still happy. But lo and behold, we have, see two firemen with a large ladder running toward the man because they're gonna get the man out and certainly the cat off the branch. So they're parked and they're going in the back. But the thing is the man should have taken the ladder and gone up safely. Not the, what he tried to do by himself and the girl will get her cat back because the firemen are gonna get the cat down and gonna get the man down and the little bird, he'll just stay there because he's not gonna be bothered. Birds are that way. They, they stick to a place if they like it and the little dog will stop barking and go home with the girl or maybe they'll go, he'll go where she goes on a tricep or she's gonna go home with the cat. Make sure he's all right. And the dog will follow. And the story is when you have your tools, make sure you use them first. I need whole wheat bread and there's a special bread that I like. It's called 17 grain bread. So I get the bread, I'll get two slices. I get peanut butter and I like it with the nuts in it. So I wish, wish that around my, um butters spon and I spread it very easily on both pieces. And then I have some jelly on the side. It could be raspberry or strawberry or whatever I happen to have, I'll say raspberry and then I just put it over it very gently. So the sandwich will stick nice and then I cover it over and I cut it in four pieces so that it's easier to eat instead of holding the whole piece of bread. I hold this one piece at a time and, uh, I know I enjoy that type of sandwich. Well, that would be my car accident back in quite a few number of years ago.

The first thing you have to do is go to the freezer and get the bread out of the freezer and you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesn't dry out. And if there's only two of you in the house, you don't go through a loaf of bread a day. So it's important to keep it fresh. So you keep the bread in the freezer. So go to the freezer, grab the loaf of bread, take it out, untwist the twist tie, take out two slices of bread, put the twist tie back on, put the bread back in the freezer, close the door, uh grab a plate out of the cupboard and get a knife out of the silverware drawer. I go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter. Uh bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter. Go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly, put the jar of jelly on the counter. Uh, open up the peanut butter, take a knife, um, grab some peanut butter on the knife, spread it on the bread. Um Put the put the peanut butter on the whole slice of bread on one side and put the lid back on the peanut butter. Open up the jar of jelly, uh take the knife and take the other slice of bread and spread the jelly on the second slice. You never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with. So put the, put the jelly on the other slice of bread and you find it because the bread is frozen. It's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly. After you've spread the peanut butter and the jelly slap the two sides together. Turn them over like this. Cut them in half or quarters. You can cut on the diagonal, you can cut cross eyes, you can cut vertical, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want. If you have a five year old grandson, you cut them into about eight pieces after you've um, cut it. Now you gotta put the peanut butter back in the cupboard, put the jelly back in the refrigerator and put the knife in the dishwasher and then go get a glass, pour yourself a glass of milk, take the peanut butter sandwich, peanut butter jelly sandwich and the milk. Sit down at the table and have a nice lunch. We have a crisis on our hands. Spoke if this was the evening news that would be reported by one of those talking heads that's very serious about everything. We have a little cat that's up in the tree and the cat belongs to a little girl and dad who's gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down, climbed up on the ladder. Something happened, the ladder fell down. Now, we've got the cat and the dad up in the tree, the dog is helping by standing at the bottom of the, of the tree. Barking a lot noise always helps somehow or other. The firemen found out about it and they've come and they've got a ladder and they're going to come over and set the ladder up, get dad out of the tree and I'll probably get the cat out of the tree too. And then dad will be happy. The cat will be happy.

If it looks like you're starting a, uh, a run, you know, like if you have the queen of hearts and the nine of hearts and the 10, then you know, all you need is a jack. So once we've gotten our hands all organized, we flip over the top card and then we've decided that you're going first because I was the dealer. Ok. So you look at that card and you look at what's in your hand and you decide if that card will help you at all as you're trying to build your gym. If it looks like it would go with what you have, you take it and you put it in, then you have to discard because you never have more than seven cards in your. It's my turn if I want the card that you discard it, if I can take that and then I discard one. If you want the one that I just discarded, you can take that. We go back and forth and back and fort, but eventually one of us is gonna want something other than what was put down there. So you flip the next card over or you have to take.

Eventually one of us is going to have created the hand of Jim. And so what you'll have is you will have picked up a car, let's say it's the one you've been waiting for into your hand. It goes and you've been holding on to this one extra card over here that you really don't need and you take that card and you put it face down. I think you see when the person screams because they realize that you had the cards, they need it all. Then the way it's scored is you have to lay your cards out. If you have three of a kind, then you put that over to the side. If you have four in a row, you know, we put that over to the side, anything that you have that's left over that didn't fit into your hand.

It was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become sore and aggravated. So I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out. The best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better. But afterwards, going home, I had to take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better, which gave me vivid dreams. And I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo. And when I woke up screaming, my mother had come in to take care of me. And it turned out, I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake. And apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsil. After about a week, I got better and I was happy that I never had to do that again. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes, please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it. I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired and in order to work with her and explain directions and meet with her on a regular basis, we went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from my speech into sign language to explain what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates, meetings, et cetera. In addition, we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily, to get around any communication barriers that we had because of her hearing impairment."}, {"segment_name": "wright69a_95780_270070.wav", "aws_transcription": "Well, yes, I remember being hospitalized. The most recent one was in New York City. I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt Hospital. And, um, my right lung had filled up with fluid. And, um, so they kept me, I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked. The towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower. Uh, they didn't come. So I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel. Um, I have veins that are very difficult to get blood. So I'd always say kiddingly to the people. Are you really good at this? And one man named Joe L told me he was terrific. He, he, no problem. After about 20 pokes in my hand. I said, could you find someone else to draw blood because we're not getting it done here? And, um, it was really all I could do to get better so I could get out of the place because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need. I can also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night. Of course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things and she couldn't find the bathroom. So she just used whatever facilities she could find. And when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient that's dying. So I was so un accustomed to hospitals and I'm probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before. And, um, I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there. So that was my experience. That's probably the worst experience I've ever had in the hospital because everything else has always been done very well.

So I went to the emergency room and the nurse checked me out and put some uh iu were cut in my eye and give me a pain pill, excuse me. And she called the doctor and the doctor called when I got home, made arrangements to meet her at the office. So we got down to the office and she checked my eye out again with another machine and then it was just a rub mark. It wasn't a scratch or a tear or anything when the lubricant would work. So I went, when we went, she gave us a prescription for the lubricant. We get down the drug if that it was for somebody else's name, another patient's name. Well, the first drug store we went to, they wouldn't cover it. It was a Walgreens, but it's not the Walgreens that we normally go to and they wouldn't honor the prescription. So they suggested that we got an over the counter lubricant which wasn't, uh, didn't have any antibiotics in it. So I was reluctant to mix them. So we got home, we called the doctor again and that was say, 12 o'clock, one o'clock. And by the time we finally got a call back from the doctor, I had called, I had a call twice to a service. When she finally called back, she laughed. She said, oh, I should have know that. So, what she did that was around six o'clock.

Um, I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather because he was the, one of the most important people in my life when I was a child. And I was, it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten, it was in July. And, um, it was just a normal day. I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street. And it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom. You, you went out the door and came in for lunch and then he went out the door and there really weren't very many parameters and there were lots of fun adventures to be had. And, um, we came home to find out that he had had a, that they didn't use the word stroke, but that's what he had, um, that he had to go to the hospital from work. And so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home, he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like I have that feeling of what it felt like. Um, to find out that, you know, he wasn't coming home and just as a child, an innocent child, um, kind of coming to terms with life and death saying, wow, and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And, um, I had, my four sisters were there and my cousin who, um, was in the nursing home, she was around because she, she kind of lived with us for a while. And it was just, she actually, I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard. Everyone went to all the adults went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that and I was hysterical crying. I was so, so sad and she didn't know what to do. So she actually slapped me to get me and it worked. She wasn't being mean, but I was beyond being consoled at that point. And I, I felt very alone in my grief for some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who is my grandfather. But anyway, that, that, that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future. And I remember a time when, um, I was in sixth grade and we were having a sleepover in my friend's backyard, happened to be with a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots. A girl who lost her young brother to Leukemia. The other girl had lost her grandmother and I had lost my grandfather. And we, it was like they could make a movie about the bond. We were all in the tent and we were just talking and I can see us all sitting there and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there. It was probably the safest place to ever let it go. And we all just, just let it out. And I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this and it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is, is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life. You know, as I grew up and also as I had mentioned yesterday that um I didn't know about angels then, but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe.

My husband's favorite, um, from there we went to is in Malaga. A very nice city, very friendly people, interesting architect back to Genoa and then on to Genoa where we spent a night and then flew home, we'll leave the airplane trip back in the realm of nightmares, at least from Charlotte to Phoenix and Us Air.

And if you want to contaminate your jelly, you can use the same knife. If not, you might want another knife to spread jelly on the other piece of bread.

She, she got to be fair but not really Ferri because she was ugly at that point. Sort of Dorian Gray going on here, but she gets struck by lightning and she dies. I feel like there's more to that. So the seven doors come home and they're very sad and traumatized in the fact that Snow White is dead. I guess they decided that it was because of the apple because she's holding an apple.

So Susie was outside playing, uh, on her tricycle and their cat Scruffy was, was out there with her and Scruffy decided to climb up the tree and, uh, just like most cats, uh, likes ignoring humans. So it crawled up the limb and crawled up to way far out. And so, um, she went inside to and told her dad to come and say, hey, can you help me get the cat down. So the dad decides that he's going to uh rescue the cat Scruffy with the by getting the ladder and climbing up there. So as he gets the ladder, puts it against the tree, um the dog sparky uh came over and actually knocked the ladder down. So not only was the dad, uh not only was the cat scruffy in the tree, but the dad was to. So meanwhile, someone had to call the, uh, fire department to come and help because the dad was too far up. It's too high to jump. It's, uh, he can't climb down because there's only a few branches. So the firefighters are on their way to come and save the day.

But he said we had a little bit of help from somewhere other than what I could do. And from that moment on today I have not had any problems except occasionally since it was a tender area. I was not able to wear high boots or high shoes because it would irritate it to the point where it would heal. But we finally got over that and I went through the service, I wore a combat boots and that a problem at all. And I've never had any problems since that time, never had any limping or anything else. It was foreshortened by about maybe a half an inch, but my body adjusted to it and my right leg bowed enough so that I never had a limp. But that did create a problem where I had to have a knee replaced a few years ago because of the angle and the pressure on that knee caused by this over the years.

He's like a farmer kind of guy living in a small town and one day he had a stroke and he was left in a chair and this was, I mean, this had to be like the seventies or the eighties. It was a long time ago. Right?

Nor could he be able to express himself the way that he wanted to. And I remember, uh, his wife was, her name was Vita also very sweet woman and she would run around and try to help him as much as she possibly could. And, and I just kind of as I was probably about nine or 10, but I remember thinking, dude, she's trying so hard and, and I probably was in my mind, I probably wasn't very kind to him because I could empathize with her more than I could with him. But I thought, you know, I think that he needs to realize she's really working hard to make it, make this man happy. But now if I look at it from his view, he had the full capacity to walk around and, and he was a, a man, you know, he'd go out and build things and mow the lawn and do all of these different activities for his entire life. And that's what defined him. But then all of a sudden he wasn't able to do that and he grew really quite cantankerous and very, very frustrated. And, um, you know, in the end, I don't remember what ended up happening with him. It's like, but I just have that really strong memory of how much that he was struggling and she was struggling.

Otherwise I may have taken it off the counter for my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread because it would give me the extra flavor of the crust. So, once I located my bread, I now have my peanut butter. I would go to my drawer where I keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife or a dinner type knife and begin spreading the peanut butter onto the bread. What I like to do. Uh In, in, in here, this is where the jelly messes you up. Is that when I make, I usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of the, well, on one side of, but on both slices of bread, in this case, I have to go and alter my pan and have them the peanut butter only on one piece of bread and I would use the jelly on the other. Now, since I don't have a whole one jelly in my house, I do keep at least one bottle or a jar or whatever you call it in my refrigerator. And it will usually always be strawberry because I just like strawberry and it's just like a, it's a good default jelly.

So when they, so uh Cinderella didn't have her own to compare with it. But when um they came to the house, they turned it on Cinderella and the Cinderellas, but we're not married. Great. Ok. So last for this first test, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Ok. So you're gonna buy a loaf of bread. You can either buy white or eat, it doesn't matter. It's your personal preference. And then you go and get, um, peanut butter. The best kind is chippy. And if you can get jelly, it doesn't matter. Um, strawberry grape, whatever kind. And then you're gonna open up the bag of bread. You don't want to get the first slice, get the slices after that and you lay them flat like this. And if you're like me, you're gonna cut the crust off first with the knife, but just don't take any of the actual bread off, just the crust. And then you're going to take that knife and you're going to dip it in the jar of peanut butter, get some peanut butter out of that knife and smooth it over the bread. Just one slice. And then you're gonna take that same. I don't know, you're gonna get a spoon and then you're gonna skip some jelly out and you're gonna dump it on the other slice of bread that you didn't put the peanut butter on and you're gonna smooth it over that slice of bread and then you're going to um, put the two pieces together on the peanut butter and jelly side.

There's about 100 and 25 of us there, there was about 15 men and 100 some odd women, mostly, maybe not exactly that, but it was that kind of proportion.

Well, this reinforce that. And uh it's very women have a, that's why if you go back to that story, I might have said this women have a need. Men do too.

They don't need any dialogue on it or not, but they need somebody to listen. So I learned to, to just sit and listen.

So fortunately someone has their cell phone and they call the fire department and the fire department comes and gets the daddy down from the tree and gets the cat down from the tree and the little girl named Molly.

Pretty much. I think I was like, not sleeping for two hours, but for some reason I just didn't, you know, I, I'm oblivious to these things. Like when you're not married, you don't have a wife that tells you go to the doctor. So I went to work on Monday and ended up drinking. Noticed I drank, must have had 15 cups of tea and I was like, yeah, you're probably sick. But, yeah, you're not. So you stayed all day. And then Tuesday, I woke up feeling totally crap in bed all day, stayed home from work. Same thing Wednesday. And then Thursday morning I Wednesday actually, I called, made an appointment for the doctor and then Thursday I canceled the doctor appointment thinking well, you're not that sick and went to work. And then by Thursday afternoon was sick again, had really bad sore throat. Thursday night went to the doctor Friday and the doctor said, yeah, you got swine flu probably. But since you've had it for a week. There's nothing we can do about it. So, just go home and drink liquids and chicken soup and whatever bad sore throat. Friday night, slept all day Saturday, slept all day Sunday and felt like crap, but a little bit better went to work Monday and then still kind of felt tired the rest of the rest of the week and that was swine flu.

Well, apparently there was a cat and this cat ran up the tree and like cats are known to do, the cat wasn't coming down and it looks like the dog actually possibly chased the dog, the cat up the tree. In the meantime, we have a little girl with her tricycle and she has called her daddy to come help get the cat out of the tree. Daddy took a ladder to the tree and somehow I'm gonna guess also again, the dog knock the ladder down. So dad is up the tree. He hasn't got the cat. There's a bird singing, but I don't think the bird has anything to do with this story. Somehow someone called the fire department. So they are on their way with a second ladder and you can see the fire truck parked off in the distance to help retrieve the dad and retrieve the cat. And that will be the end."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL6-1_806028_954558.wav", "aws_transcription": "Oh, goodness. Ah, ok. We have a little girl. There was ok, one, there was a little girl whose name was Annie. Annie had a cat whose name was, uh, uh spot. And one day Annie was playing outside the spot and also with her dog, uh, Rover, and he and Rover chased the cat around the yard and the cat ran up into the tree, got to a far branch of the tree and sat down. Well, Annie was really worried about that. She was afraid that that spot, the cat was not gonna be able to get down. So she called her dad and ask him to come, please please help get the cat out of the tree. So her dad use a ladder to climb up onto the first main branch of the tree. And the cat was on one of the, the smaller branches branching right off of that one, but he couldn't get any farther and the ladder he ended up, I accident pushing the ladder down. Thank goodness, the ladder didn't hit any. But meanwhile, Annie is still very, very upset. So somebody perhaps her mom called the fire department. And so the fire department, the firefighters have brought their truck along with a, it looks like about the same size ladder and, uh, they're going to help either the dad or the cat out of the tree. Although perhaps both my guess is the cat can get out of the tree any time she wants to. Um, but so my guess is once they help the dad out of the tree, then they will go in the house and get something nice to drink and the cat will come down on her own and the dog, especially if they get the dog back in the house with them so that he can stop barking at everybody. So I think that's what's going to happen. The dad got down from the tree, they went in the house, the cat casually climbed back down out of the tree and disappeared behind the house and"}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL6-1_230779_379129.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok. Ok. Um, uh, I guess I have with my mother. Um, although it was, it was stroke related but it was not aphasia, it was, um, dementia.

Um, I saw her once a month, uh, she was living with her sister and, uh, so I didn't have the brunt of the difficulty my, uh, my aunt did. Um, and so what, what I ended up doing when I came to visit was primarily trying to support my aunt and her supporting of my mom. But what I discovered one time I had to stay with my mom while my aunt was in the hospital and I was finding it very frustrating and difficult. And, um, so what I discovered is that if I, if I was really frustrated in having a hard time, kind of doing what I needed to do. If I would ask her about her childhood, I could get all kinds of fabulous stories and she remembered lots and was able to tell me stuff that I hadn't heard before, which was wonderful. And, um, later on after my mom died, my aunt ended up with just age, just eight. Very old. She, by this time she was 92 or three and was very hard to communicate with because she basically didn't follow what you were saying and couldn't really understand necessarily. And so what we did then I say we, because it was me and my cousins, her Children, um, basically just tried to tell her that, you know, listen to her when she wanted to say something, she, she would tell jokes which just used to just amaze me that she would tell this crazy. She always loved goofy dumb jokes. And so she would continue to tell those. And so we had to, we enjoyed that and we made sure she knew that and we just tried to reassure her about who she was and where she was and who we were and sometimes she had moments of clarity and sometimes she didn't and we just had to keep up with her whatever she was doing."}, {"segment_name": "wright24a_91820_239866.wav", "aws_transcription": "No, has a speech problem.

But now that he's had the speech classes, you can understand him a lot better. Now, um let's see, I had, was driving down the street uh with my kids in my car and my husband and we were stopped at a traffic light and I happened to look up into the rear view mirror and saw a van coming at us and everybody else was stopped and the van was still coming. So I got scared because I knew we were going to get hit by that van. So I put my foot on the brake to try to keep the car from sliding forward when the guy in the van hit us, which he did hit us and we did go forward. We had some shaved ice and when he hit us, the shaved ice flew all over inside the car and I had stopped the car, put the brake on. And so we didn't hit the car in front of us, luckily, but we were very scared. We got out of the car and the guy took off and so we just pulled into the next place and called the police and waited for the police to show up. Ok. Um, It looks to me like in this picture, uh it looks like that there was some bad weather, a lot of rain, maybe some flooding and it looks like a lady might have got, have been in a car and either got out of her car to try to get out and get out of the water or whatever and she was floating down the river and got trapped or stopped by a tree branch. And someone on the side may have looked and seen and called the paramedics or 911.

Are you cold? Do you want a jacket? And he can tell me yes or no. Recently we have tried something else called um Well, it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles and I put them into letter boxes for him to see if that might work. If he could make some words to show me what he wanted and we have had a very limited success with that, but I would not say it's the magic bullet can make a simple word if I ask him to such as cheese. What kind of sandwich do you want? Cheese or bacon or um, what do you want to drink? And he can write, he will sometimes write juice with the letter tiles only on two occasions though.

So it was really something that I think I really remembered. In addition to me being sad, I thought about how difficult it was for my father. Um, and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas Eve, we put everything up then and then we would get up. So my mother did have all of us do that. But I remember thinking how sad my mom was and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers and my dad didn't come home. Till very late. And then he was there, of course on Christmas morning when we got up, but it was a difficult Christmas and I do remember that very vividly. Yeah. Mhm. That's some story. Ok. Now we're gonna switch gears a little bit. Something very serious. Something ridiculous. So I'm gonna show you some pictures. So take a little time to look at these pictures because they tell a story, take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end and you can look at the pictures as you tell me the story. Ok, one day, a boy was walking home from school playing with a soccer ball and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbor's window. His neighbor was sitting watching television and the ball came through, knocked over his lamp and caused quite, um, and caused quite a loud noise. His neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off."}, {"segment_name": "richardson59_36690_181593.wav", "aws_transcription": "So a little boy is kicking a soccer ball around and he kicks it either too hard or too far into a window of a house that he's nearby. And the man or the owner of the house sitting in a chair right next to the window, it hits a lamp right next to my coffee table and he gets up, picks the ball up and looks out the window to see where the ball came from. Ok, great. So next, um, pretty much the same thing again, I'd like for you to take a look at these pictures and they tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So, um, whenever you're ready, just go ahead and tell me that story. So his mom is telling her son to take an umbrella with him to school, but he doesn't feel like he needs it. He leaves realizes that it's raining and then it starts to rain a little bit harder. So he goes back to his mom. His mom is a little bit angry at him. We're just a little bit, uh, I guess just angry at him for not taking the umbrella. And he finally finally decides to take the umbrella with him to school. Ok. Ok. So now, um, I'd like for you to take a look at this picture, you can see there's a lot going on here. Um, but together it tells a story. So I'd like for you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So it looks like the little girl was playing on her tricycle and probably noticed the cat that was stuck in the tree. And then the man that is in the tree probably came by and was either trying to help get the cat out of the tree or the dog chased him up the tree and was because he was trying to bite him or a combination of the two. And then he probably decided since the girls looks to be really young to call the fire department to help them get the cat out of the tree as well as himself."}, {"segment_name": "MSUC03b_18509_163264.wav", "aws_transcription": "Oh, gee. Hm. Actually I fainted once and that's a terrible feeling. And I guess, you know, I guess we could compare that to a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset and you do have a short window, if it's the same as a stroke. In my case, there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong. And you do have time to, to be cognizant of being in big trouble. In fact, I remember one time I, I, uh, I fainted, I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house and that was, I was really afraid of, of the fact that I was in a hard tile room. And, uh, my daughter was downstairs, I guess she was, oh, maybe around seven or eight. And I just in a panic, I said, Dolly call 911. So I knew I was in trouble and I, I, then I, I was able to just slowly go down myself and then I went out of the picture and the paramedics did take me to the hospital and I had food poisoning. And, uh, when I got the, now that was really frightening because you know, they're racing me through the, the, er, they're asking me, you know, all sorts of information and, and the pocketbook disappears and then, you know, testing and monitors and all that and they said, you know, your potassium level is in the basement. So it was really, and, you know, you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either, you know, in the hospital or even dying. And they told me, yeah, when the potassium levels go down to those sort of sub levels, organs can start shutting down rather quickly. So it was truly an emergency situation. So when my daughter, as young as she was, you know, I credit Natalie with, you know, the fact that it wasn't worse that she, she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed 911. Yeah.

So I had went and had an electrocardiogram at my primary care physician. And he said that was all right, which they don't show anything anyway. He said he suggested a stress echo. So I, I had a stress echo and I went to it and I failed it and I was kind of shocked and I was going to do things afterwards and I just called my wife and talked to her and then I went home and, and then they did a cardiac cat the next day and, uh between the first day and the second day, they gave me nitroglycerine and I just didn't do anything because I didn't want to have a heart attack and died."}, {"segment_name": "wright85a_442263_581765.wav", "aws_transcription": "Ok.

And the step sisters dressed up in their finest and they went to the ball. Well, Cinderella's fairy godmother showed up and told her she was gonna get to go and Cinderella said, oh, but I have nothing to wear. So the very godmother waved her wand and she had a beautiful dress on and glass slippers and she says I have no way to get there. And her godmother showed her outside that there was a big pumpkin as a carriage and there was mice that were the footman and the drivers. And she said the only thing is you have to leave by midnight. So Cinderella went to the ball and she met the uh prince and they just loved each other from the moment they met, well, the clock started to strike 12 and Cinderella remembered what her fairy godmother told her. And so she left the ball running and she lost one of her glass slippers on the steps. And so the prince started looking for her and he couldn't find her, but he found a glass slipper. So he said, I'll go find whoever this fits and that'll be her. So naturally the step sisters decided, oh, this glass slipper got to fit one of us. Well, they tried it, their feet wouldn't fit in it because Cinderella had a Danny little foot. And so finally, um Cinderella got to try on the glass zipper.

But we, I had a full airplane and we were coming in to land and, um, the pilots decided to go around because they couldn't see the runway and when they went to go around because we're down in this valley, the mountains all around, you have to circle in, into this valley in Aspen and you can't see anything where the mountains are while we were circle coming in and they decided to go around and they didn't pull the gear up when they went around. So they stalled the airplane. And what that feels like is your whole airplane is like shaking and shuttering and going like this and, and we could see the tops of the trees and somehow they put it in a nose dive to get the speed up and then they were able to barely able to pull it out. And everybody's looking at me and I'm the flag. I have to smile. And, um, um, my crew is normally they're allowed to make two, attempts and they said that's it. We're done. We're going back to Denver. We're not even, we're done for the day. And I guess the guys that work on the ramp are the ones waiting flag us, saw, saw the airplane come in and they saw what happened and we almost crashed right over this really, um, fancy area called Starwood where all the celebrities live. Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and Don Johnson. They all had their homes up in Starwood, Denver at the time that we almost, they said they, they saw us, like disappear over the mountain and our hearts just went in their throats.

Mother and daddy always told me my birthday was May the 13th, 1938. I sent to Frankfurt for my birth certificate. My, my birth cert certificate had a number of problems. It said my birthday was May the 15th, 19 and 83. It said to this woman had been born, seven other Children, all of which are dead.

So I got some very expensive, uh, suppo and, um, they really didn't work very well. And by the time I got to Vermont, which is where we went, I could tell this was coming back.

Yes. And you take that knife and you stab it so that you feel less bad about scooping some out. So you scoop them out and you spread it on one of the breads, which hopefully, at this point is cool enough that you can do that. Bread should be a little crunchy but not toasted per se. And so you spread that on there. You don't want too much, um, say a centimeter of peanut butter. Like maybe that's a little too thick, but that's the idea. You want like a decent amount of peanut butter and then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you don't want to wash it off in the sink and get another knife. It sounds like a lot of effort. Let's be Frank. And then you put the lid back on the peanut butter, put it back in the cabinet, you pull the jelly toward yourself, you unscrew that you set the lid down, it's new. You feel less bad about ruining it because even though it's an equally perfect surface. It's kind of darker and so it's not as pretty as the golden loveliness of the peanut butter. And so then what I like to do is I like to stab it also and stir it up up a little bit because it's easier to spread if you're not just like getting out a g loop of it to stir it up. Some, get into a nice, you know, little liquidy consistency, but it's still, you know, jelly and then you angle it over your second slice of bread and then you take the knife to scrape some out. You can try to just scoop them out on top of the knife, but it will fall off. It just scrapes them out of the loose stuff and then spread that thinly on top. Not too thinly, little less than you did for the peanut butter, but not much. And then you take these pieces and you take the peanut butter piece and you put it on top of the jelly piece because you don't want the jelly to fall off if you put it on top of the peanut butter piece.

So this girl named Little Red Riding Hood was sent to visit her grandma in the forest to bring her some food from her mother. And as she was going along the forest, this wolf spotted her and wanted to eat her. So the wolf thought that he'd go and go to the grandma's house and pretend to be the grandma.

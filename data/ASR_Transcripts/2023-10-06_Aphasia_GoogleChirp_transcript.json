much you couldn't remember anything about it um but it's you just take your time trying to me and my mom my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything still i can't but if you get to rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about those things but then you forgot about the other things you get back so it doesn't keep everything in their lone so you just got to keep everything keep where you're for getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk mostly taking my time so if i talk too much people have no idea what i'm doing and they talk to me real quick this is kind of weird because if one person talking to me kills me if there's three people i can understand other people i can understand what it is but so it takes time how i'm getting around everything so um so it's just it keeps going every year and stuff like that just get a little better um i don't how long i can go but it's just it seems like i'm still doing something with it so um and it keeps going over time so so i try to ride every day all kinds of stuff like cat but um i just my mom's very helping that and my sisters have helped a little bit there too if they needed to do something like that and um i have my brothers too"}, {"filename": "NEURAL42-2_407714_408984.wav", "transcript": " just anything you're telling me or"}, {"filename":

there for five days i only dately remember some of that and then stuff i can start to remember is when i was brought back and i stayed there for 10 days and pretty much most of that i remember remember but i guess again i couldn't read at all at that point i could speak but a lot of words i you know people could kind of understand what i was saying but i couldn't always say what i was trying to say"}, {"filename": "UNH01b_421656_545259.wav", "transcript": " i like that term golden people that's interesting no they are golden people is that for the golden dog oh is it for the owners or for the dogs it's for gold golden people have golden retrievers yeah i love it all right now i'm just going to show you some photos um so you can have a few time to look at them of course and then i just want you to describe the pictures to me they tell a story so if you could tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end all right so i guess the beginning i see a child out in the yard playing with a socker ball and apparently while he's playing he kicks it and it goes through the window and it goes through the window i'm assuming it's in his well i guess it's i'm assuming it's his home there's a there's a gentleman here that will just assume it's his father so it goes through the window it the father sees that ball probably actually hits him and then he grabs the ball and he looks at the window and yeah he's clearly i'm assuming not very happy that his window was broken bit of all wonderful i know thankfully that's never happen never did that to my mom yeah cuz whether whether that's the parent or just the owner of the house it's probably not very happy i know i know i don't know what i would be more scared of if it was my neighbor yeah i know and i guess technically from this we can't tell the person is um all right and then here's another photo for the same thing it tells a story with the beginning a middle and end so just look at the photos and tell me that all right what i'm guessing from this is the child is getting ready to leave for school from his home and i would say his mother is saying you should take an umbrella and i'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella and so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella he gets part way to school and it starts pouring so i'm assuming he's unhappy that he's soaking wet and looks like"}, {"filename": "UNH01b_740345_973220.wav", "transcript": " so like obviously i recognize i guess strangely i don't recognize this person if she is really that person yes so why is she

through most of the think she's story yeah you remember her that way yes that was my only question all right now i know what she is i cannot come up with the word for what she is okay i get the gist of it all right so tell me the story of sinderella well see again the just of it was not the right words but i mean cinderella was was a young girl that she was she was working for them and the other girls i guess she was helping taken care see again that i don't have the right words of who they were but the mother and the the two sisters and and they were going to the ball she wasn't supposed to go to the ball i guess she saw one of their in that picture it looks like one of their dresses and she thought it was a very nice dress and she tried it on and i guess they saw her tried it on they must have yel they didn't look happy but cuz again they the the other girls went to the to the ball um cinderella wished she could and when she wished the woman appeared who i cannot come up with the word for what that magical woman was called but she came up she showed up and she raved her magic wand gave her a nice dress and sent her off to the to the wall um the prince picked her out and oh i know the woman her magic wand i still can't come up with"}, {"filename": "UNH01b_975904_1060054.wav", "transcript": " she was only cinderella was only allowed to be dressed up that way and be there

carriage but anyways they were all going to go back to where they came from the the woman with the magic wand turned them all into what oh and see that's this is where i get stuck with words she was riding the horse was pulling the carriage but that's not what i want to say but anyways that would all turn back to what it was originally and so she when she knew she had to leave she ran away the prince was looking for and all he found was her shoe her glass glass shoe her glass something it's another word her glass slipper there we go um and so then he went to search he took the glass slipper and went to search for who would fit that glass slipper and tried it on to the other two girls who were there and they wanted to be that person and it didn't fit them and they tried it on cinderella

got two and a half years ago was for the um yeah the see if i can remember psychological evaluation so i had the like the reneurological evaluation anyways i i was in within the normal range i think

is only allowed to be there until midnight and so she's kept looking at the clock she's good at that she's watching and um so as they were dancing or everything she thought oh i got to go and so um of course he probably said can we just longer and she said no i got to go so she's running and um i'm sure even the one of the guys who work there even had a question and she i think she said i got to go and um so as she went one of her shoes fall down and um she gets all the way home and of course you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for back and there's the dog and everybody's sitting

wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around to be able to do all that at the beginning they started doing some little task for me like um we played cards to see how many cards i can find looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that but we were doing that just here and there feeling um i was also very sad very um emotional feeling didn't i couldn't even remember who i was and so i'm getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are i was more panicked than that kind of stuff um once i remembered who i was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year to uh days i figured out how people were that i remembered so um said let's go for our therapy now let's start walking around and stuff so once i figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit um we started working on therapy and um they said you have a phasia um and my talking i couldn't say pretty much any i couldn't say anything they were saying like do you want something to eat i didn't understand what that meant so they give me like a cup do you want something to drink they take the cup and show me and i go yes or no it took me a even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it if you don't want it it goes this way took that long to figure that out little things like that that i didn't remember um then once i was able to at least think a little bit more we started with um uh pictures like that bird and the and the boy and the banana and uh we start that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words and um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else so still working on therapy myself i have a a book at home that i still do my homework

time i spent time as a at the rehab hospital of indiana as a volunteer 04:307 uh and um because i i started o4 which is 20 years after the 84 84 injury and it became rather troubling to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain injured in those years so there's no therapy just you are able to survive is to like you're able to just get discharge hospital go home uh and uh buse they just did not do therapy in those years and and over the course of next 20 years uh wife and i found out about uh from people that had at theerapy brain injuries later that the uh uh divorce rate amongst the brain injured approach 90 and the suicide rated points to brain injured is four to five times national average is what they're telling people even 15 years ago um and so i wanted to to wanted to share that with with the patients at rhi to just to give them hope that uh that recovery is recovery is possible but it is tag long time and in 04 when i started there at rhi uh it was i heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families a year to a year and half recovery year to year and half recovery year to you never recover hey you don't stop recovering the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty radically after a year to year and a half but you never never stop recovering uh i had a in the 84 incident i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left tip and it was just something that i accepted and it was like compunction without it you know no big deal but to stick a pin there wouldn't feel it uh no no big deal and then it was probably believe five years ago or 20 25 i think it was yeah i think it was 0.9 25 years after the 84 incident i was in the in the bedroom put on my sock socks one morning and i had feeling in the spot i had no feeling for 25 years so what i'm what i'm telling you ashley is that the recovery may slow down like i say and mathematically described asymptotic but but still slow down significantly but but still you never stop recover you just don't stop recovery yeah i'm done preaching"}, {"filename": "tucson20a_11097_12827.wav", "transcript": " pretty good for me"}, {"filename":

And by this time, her carriage had turned into a pumpkin and her Horsemen and turned into my home, but she finally got home. I forgot exactly how, but she got home and there she was by the again, but in the Cinders by the fireplace and the other two daughters off course. They had this story to tell. ButHello came an Envoy from the kingdom and he said we're trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper. And of course, the mother. Mothers that I would go back to the the center's we get through with you."}, {"filename": "example_segment1.wav", "transcript": "And that's it. Here, we have a mother and a child with the number of the mothers holding the umbrella. And the mother is trying to get the child to take the umbrella and the child is saying the boy it is saying no nothing Michael, take it. Which upsets the mother, but she doesn't get her way. So the void takes off and it starts dripping, and it gets harder, and it starts raining more, and it's not anymore. But he goes back home. He is soaking wet. She is upset with him and he's got a download face, and then off ends with him walking back, I guess towards school with the number,Okay. This looks like a fireman. Or arrest man in the rescue system and I could be in the ambulance system has a life jacket on. Has jumped into a swirling sort of a creek, trying to pull out a little girl, and who's hanging on to this women getting and saving the little girl from the from the Raging Waters of this swelled Creek, due to The Rains of the cock.This is the story of a little girl Little Orphan girl. Comes from a very poor family. My name is Cinderella and she is just set off to another home. Like a woman and two daughters who are not very welcoming at all. In fact, the daughters are quite jealous.And the woman is quite almost mean she. She tries, they make a servant out a friend or relative, she waits on the the daughters and the mother and and foot cleaning picking up after him, trying to take care of a cat, which has long horns on it. And the cat doesn't like it at all. Well, Cinderella, there's a big ball annual ball coming up at the castle.And McCain has raised holy Cain with his son, about finding the wife. And and defies, but throw this poem. To get him introduced to the young ladies or the young ladies. And the community introduced to him, that he might be able to find a wife. She looks out at the across the rooftops to the castle. And she wishes, she could go but she can't. She's poor them in the daughters jealous of where they don't want her to do anything. All they're interested in is in their own well-being and how they're going to look at, while they're going to dress and what I'm going to put on and this and that, and they squabble and bicker and fight among themselves. And in the meantime,Cinderella looks at someone in the gowns with the girls are going to stop and think, well, there's about four mice. Enter the picture about this time who are friends of Cinderella and realize her predicament and by golly, they go to the Fairy Godmother and and and and they take Cinderella there."}, {"filename": "example_segment2.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so Cinderella, Once upon a time, there was Maybe Cinderella or Ella and then I think they added the cinder cuz she was dirty or something cuz she had to clean anyway so there's this girl and she found family and her father was a little well off and then her mother ended up dying. And so her fatherHer father remarried, a woman the evil stepmother who had two daughters Anastasia and maybe I don't think I remember. They had like longer kind of a mouthful names and so they ended up moving in and like the Two Sisters, they took care of a lot. And the the step mom didn't like Cinderella and then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the E. Mother and the two evil stepsisters.And this is so weird to tell like, and so, then the evil stepmother was like, you're not going to be a baby in the house cuz she didn't really like her. So she like exiled her to like a rip in the attic and that made her pretty much a servant and One day, the prince, prince charming and that was that he was having a ball. I think in order to look for a wife or something like that, andThe step sisters or the mother really wanted. The steps are sister, got the steps just wanted to go to cuz they wanted to go meet the prince and have their shot at him to see if they could marry him and Cinderella's like Uncle. Maybe I'll go in the stepmother like got nope and so I think Cinderella has her animal accomplices. I know one's device. Name is Gus Gus. I don't know if the other one and off her animal in the birds and stuff the same cards and they make like a dress for her. She's like looking through. I think it was her mom's stuff so she gets an old dress up her mom and then they may get all pretty and stuff for her. And so she's getting ready to go to the ball and she walks downstairs to go out and the sisters and the stack mod. They're like rip her dress apart and her buffer jewelry because they don't want her going andI think maybe they walked her room or something. I don't know how fans of getting out, but anyway, she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the bar, getting ready to go and then Fairy Godmother appears. Okay? So, doesn't try to sneak out the Fairy Godmother to finish first, and then it's like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess, and then she turns her gown. It's like this beautiful ball gown, she's in the woods somewhere. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods and the Pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into the carrot and like her animal friends, turn into horses off. And then she goes to the boss, he makes his late grand entrance and a prince is like, very fascinated with her and so they have a dance, but one of the conditions of this magic from the Fairy Godmother. Was that expires at midnight? So she's dancing with him in the clock strikes. Like, symbolized that the exact time or like midnight is coming. He said"}, {"filename": "example_segment3.wav", "transcript": "So I may as well do something right now to help make up for that. And so she cleans the place with all the help of the Woodland creatures who like the way she sings like dear dead birds and bunnies. I don't know, I think number shows up. So, she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling and then she yawns and falls all across the beds. There are seven of them and she just Falls all across the minutes about her height, give or take and said, she passes out there and about this time of the dwarves are Marching home from work. I hope I hope they work in the mines. There isDark, happy grumpy, don't be bashful. TG. Sleepy sleepy sleepy so 7th. Okay, so there are those seven dwarfs and they work in the mines Gathering, precious gems and whatnot and the cult of watching home. Because, of course, it's their home, there's a little bits for several dorms and they enter their home.And they see the strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that and off. So she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent-looking the dorms are all like. Yeah. Okay. I believe you should stay with us as long as you're in danger as long as you keep cleaning up to place and like make your food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she schooled bad. And so she lives at them happy for some time. And then the evil queen has been sitting snug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day, she saunters up to magic mirror. And she doesn't mirror mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, Still Still Snow White.Still, you didn't kill her and the evil queen flies into a rage and she decided we're going to do something, right? Do it yourself. She probably kills the hunt song, probably interrogate him, and then, kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. So, she goes down to her Lair, where she makes love potions, because as an evil queen, that's something you required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white Apple into, and pulls it out and it took his blood. And it is, of course a poison apple because that is how she rolls.And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples, hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically read and delicious looking I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified, but then she disguises herself as his old Crone and she marches off into the forest. I'm not I don't remember how she found Snow White but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her and all the doors are off to work. And Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her and a friend's broccoli and Snow White answers. The door and says, oh look an old Crone with a magically delicious. Looking Apple. I'm probably completely safe.And the old phone says, what do you like an apple child? And she says, yep. Still safe. And she takes the apple and the current says he has.

my babysitter um because really i wasn't sensible you know about a little kid you know and i wanted to get in trouble and being being bad as we call that you know um so he really had to watch me kind of um but things that he would do is he'd write down like one two three he would put all my colors down and stuff like that so those are things that i could then start practicing and stuff like that when i got well enough to the point where i they set could set me up um on a computer then i could you know look and try to figure out cities and things like that because that was like foreign i mean i didn't know where i lived i mean i know that i was in florida but i wouldn't know that name unless you say it then i would say oh that's florida so that was a big challenge because and it's still a problem names are still a problem that way um like it's you when i got to the point where i was getting simple words and things like that you know you're trying to um introduce somebody you know like my husband if i'm going to say okay this is my husband or something like that well i couldn't think of those words it would be i'd sit here and i think i can't even think of his name of course i've only been married with him you know married to him for 35 years but you know it's like well i just sit here and i could think um he's that's my um the guy that i live with that's the best i could come

stressed night anyways cuz i was on phone with a oh lawyer and different things because they weren't they were screwing my husband about stuff and you know so i got involved in that whole thing that night and of course then i usually i typically will stay up a lot because i work all the time so my husband went to bed about 11 that night and my son was working um doing some probate stuff with me so he stayed up with me until about two o'clock and he says no mom i'm getting kind of tired now so it's like okay you go to bed and i'll just keep working on what i'm doing because i was still kind

there's there's differences in in the names is a big deal still um like i say the states and stuff like that and you say where do you where do you get better well that's something that's important to me because i got to know the world is open there and i got to get those words again you know it's like okay i know we got capitals and i got to figure that out and i got to get that right again and stuff um so i mean it's just been a process of you know thinking of what what next would i have to think about you know because when you're not a person who is thinking it for yourself it's good if

sixth grade uh my cousin and myself uh we wrote um books on indians because we grew up in shitek which is indian for you know the native native um so um we we wrote a series of books and then we took first of course to the state so that was a kind of a cool thing you know but that was something that i figured we would do and of course i always wonder see that's something i want to go back and see if i can find all of my stuff everybody i i know it's all in this um basement in wisconsin but in what where you know i know my mom i used to um write um when i was in seventh grade my uh a teacher that was in eighth grade picked me out as the one that she would um prep for writing and um you know she says i need somebody to write articles every single week for the newspaper and so i did that for those two years and i mean she was awesome and i did find out a year ago that she's still alive and i'm thinking i'm gna try to find her um this summer because with the stroke this has been tremendous from me being in seventh grade learning all of this i can hear everything she's still telling me from the beginning when you're writing the uh paragraphs it's your start here you go there don't forget you don't vere off here you do that and it pops in all the time which is really interesting"}, {"filename": "whiteside20a_814633_971676.wav", "transcript": " and she would probably love that cuz i'm sure she'll remember me it's not about that but she would think how important it was in my life now especially i mean it always was because she was an awesome teacher you know i mean and it's like she says well you were a good student i told you you wrote it this is how it's you know this is how it goes so you know that's why proof reading and all that um i would all the way through college i would help all of the students because this was easy to me because i got it way back when you know it's like oh yeah i can look at your term and it's like on get to fix it you know so i mean it's it's okay but it was just simple to me but for them it was difficult you know or like um you know i think when i was a nurse and i was in my last um year um one of my uh is um she gave us a uh term paper and it was supposed to be like 10 pages and it was supposed to cover this this and you know all these things right and i can't tell you exactly what it is at this moment but um i know when she was doing um meeting with everybody she says 10 years you're the only one that's getting 100 and i thought okay that's a good thing you know because she says you covered everything you know and it's like well and and she says when did you write it and i says two days ago but i had it in my head which i always wrote right that's how i would write though it was always here but now put it putting it down you know then i could just go and there would be you know and um so i thought so that's kind of a cool thing that and but the one she thing she did say is that you will never be an er nurse because you think you'll have it all perfect which is how it is you know it still is in my head i can't do it quick because i'm going to make it i might make a mistake and i wouldn't want to have a mistake so therefore i would never put myself in that position she was absolutely right she says the way you write i could tell that you will never be any our person and i was like nope i mean i've had plenty of emergency things but that's usable"}, {"filename": "whiteside20a_96696_138816.wav", "transcript": " so i'm thinking about four o'clock though i've got all the stuff tomorrow so

something was going on and i was afraid it was a stroke but i couldn't say it was a stroke but i knew there was something going on and sharon could communicate with me well enough to know that there's problem it took me to the hospital and um did the scans and so forth and sure enough i had another i had another stroke uh while i was there in the hospital um up until that time i could not move my

wear it for a while over the side and you but i could have one eye open that time because i couldn't see uh with both eyes i see with both eyes but i'd see different different things and so uh what i had the second stroke or what is third stroke in the hospital uh i the vision started clear and i you remember telling me telling sharon i said my vision is getting better i can see better i can focus i can focus with my eyes and and i turn up i could and then i also told her that i thought i could start move my leg a little bit and you know because when you're when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not you think you're moving it but isn't and i said you look at my leg and see if it's moving and uh because i really felt like it was and indeed it was moving it was moving so

went to his office went to uh where he had an office he did have an office there he had a he came to he came to uh a university here and he would meet with people there at the university and i i was still in wheelchair at that time and uh i worked with him well i was still in world chair and then went on to work with him when i was when i was actually in and a walker for another another year and

abilities and he helped me a lot yeah in fact some of the things that we've done here remind me of some of the stuff that he's done that he did with me telling stories and and uh a lot of different

uh when i when i actually when i finally finished to the point where medicare would not provide anymore physical therapy for me uh i went to the ymca and a got membership in the y and and and hired at the y a personal trainer who who didn't really know anything about strokes but she learned she was very good at studying and learning the first time that she saw me uh and i i was so stifflish that i couldn't move like i couldn't move anything my arm was just if you see it here your arm is just like this and it's clenched fist and everything and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like holy crap i i can't move it and it would move she worked with me uh i went twice a week to go with her uh and then in addition to that uh but probably after a while i went started i say sharen take me down to the wine and let me uh i was i was still using my walker i'd say let me just take me down the y and let me walk around the track with my walker and i'm sure people probably thought stupid here's this this little guy walking around with you very very slowly take me you take it's a six six times around the track for a mile and it would take me uh half hour to walk around that lap and but i was i was determined to do it and i did it i did it and uh then eventually i got to the point where i could use my cane i still go very slowly uh i'm doing it so i'm going to have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself and i'm not trying to pat pat myself on the back i know some other stock victims who do not have the drive that i have and i'm sorry for them they don't but i think i think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive i did not lose my drive i've always been kind of driven anyway i have always been driven but i was driven to her to improve and get better i'm still doing that and i'm getting there and it will never come to an end but i will keep working at it thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you could

up in the tree to get the cat down and he he lained the ladder against the tree uh to crawl up there and uh something happened i'm going to guess maybe the dog that's barking up the tree uh ran into the ladder or something but something hit the ladder and knocked it down the dad stuck in the tree and uh i don't know who called the fire department unless he had a cell phone maybe it's maybe it i don't know he must have a cell phone he called fire department and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters carrying their ladder and they're running over to get the man down out of out of the tree uh meanwile the dog is barking up the tree i don't know if he's i don't think i don't think he's mad i think he's just barking up the tree because he wants the guy to come down or something so the uh the firemen are on the way they've got their ladder uh truck sitting out sit on sitting out on the street um there's a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away um and uh yeah and that's that's pretty much yeah it's a it's a it's a big tree big tree yeah and it is it's summertime because the trees have leaves on on uh yeah okay well that's that's not good okay"},

then uh so she says great you know i've got my two doll daughters and she can be they can all be friends yeah when when she's gone it turns out that uh cinderella actually became more of a a servant and a friend uh she must have she must have been sleeping in the uh uh at the stable with the animals i guess uh she in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters um she was doing the laundry she was doing all the work and uh like said she had become more of a slave than than anything else so um they lived in the in the shadow of of castle and um i think she dreamt about the castle um looks like she was in one picture it looks like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that it's what it looks like anyway and uh so it turns out that the the king fat king why the little short why king is all short fat but he is uh is looking for somebody to marry his his daughter and uh is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in

didn't understand where to go exactly she i think she knew she went to the emergency room but didn't know where it was and i saw the red lettering and i couldn't read it that is so significant to me because remember i could not read that word i knew what the word was but i couldn't say it to save my life um but i could say i just couldn't read it and uh so i pointed and i said emergency and so i wasn't reading it you know it was like it's red and i just know what that word is because it's red and so we got to the entrance and there was like uh i want to say a canopy but not really a canopy uh but something to keep you out of the rain and um overhang or whatever um and i caught the eye of a policeman that was uh sitting or standing there his job is to check people for weapons before they

find uh the origin of the stroke i think at this point they know what happened they just can't figure out well how come why and they never figured it out um but uh so they put me to sleep for that and

but mostly words and i tried to get that stuff done before i saw her next and um it was like really important i was just super motivated and um and then when i was released it was going to be a month

she um sent me a lot and um she just like in the hospital she was willing to send me as much as i could handle and i was so thankful for that and so i just worked on and and so i'm not in the hospital

says oh you're home early and he says no he says it's 5ive o'clock so between that time when the story was about to start and 5:00 i was out but i could talk i could walk i could nothing nothing

one that's chosen it is hard but the um mom realizes uh-oh better not have with cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen so cinderella had started to get her out fit ready and again i always like that part of the movie as i recall because i liked how the little uh animals were even helping her cuuse everything loved her cuuse she was so wonderful so they made this made her beautiful thing but then the stepmother got where she she she couldn't go and so then cinderella was really crying as i remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows cinderella understandably being heartbroken and you know how could they not even let me do anything and then there's fairy godmother person pops out of nowhere and makes it where cinderella can have a beautiful what is going to wear and where she can be driven if she gets there and she can dance and he sees her and wants to dance with her and uh he's captivated by her and um all of a sudden cinderella realizes on no it's by this it mid night where she has to leave before everything was going to change back so sinra gets home and she's still kind of happy um which is i thought that was always amazing she was still just happy and so honest about wow i got to actually do something like that she thinks that's the end that would ever be but she was still happy and so then with the prince he is like i have to find out who that who that was which i wouldn't really blame him of course he's going to want to meet her and goes he wants to he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her so um he has to go has a decree i guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person has to be uh figure out who that was

starts off least so i remember starts off showing how her husband and wife were very um very good people and they treated her as they should very very very kind and with with a lot of love and um that would would of course have been great except um like her her like mother died and i guess a lot of those like disney shows do that sometimes and um so the dad was a good man but um like a lot of people i guess would eventually think that maybe he might want to try to meet someone else and so that ends up happening and really messed up by marrying this other woman who ends up she's just so cruel and so selfish and um okay what i should said before also is that they even show earlier how happy that cinderella is with her life and so what i mean now is that the uh what is it called the other woman um she now has uh the power i guess where she's really being awful with um with with cinderella and and i guess maybe even the her dad might have died i don't remember about that anyway so they're showing they would showing the story then now how cinderella her life has just totally changed she went through um a really nice life which was deserving to her buse she was a very very very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone so now that the other mother is now there um the other mother uh makes cinderella do everything all the washing and uh everything you can think of cooking i guess cleaning whatever you do and these those two sisters that the other those called those two other girls um are just so mean to her and so just very like very snatty horrible don't even care about cinderella at all"}, {"filename": "NEURAL45-2_2384690_2592705.wav", "transcript": " only that they can get whatever they want they make her do

what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place i can't think what it's called um beautiful place so sorry somebody's walking back here and i'm i'm getting this um okay so um okay i think then the next part of the story is it shows that the um that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman i guess so oh this is hard so the um the like track where they are so the so it's made by decree that they should have a they should have this like okay this like this like ball where in the ball every girl that is not married needs to has to come there and then they'll be able to dis to figure out who's the best one that he should he should marry so then they showed in the picture if i remember right uh his her new mom seeing reading oh good we all get to go to the ball and she's excited cuuse she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will will be uh they will want one of them so they're all excited including cinderella was excited but lo and behold um i think it showed that the other mother says oh no you're not going there seems to me like i remember like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear i think"}, {"filename": "NEURAL45-2_2833068_3042468.wav", "transcript": " and they get to dance and it's just almost magical there's just obvious those two are met to be like in love so then cinteroa leaves a seas oh no it's almost midnight so she has to suddenly run he's thinking wait wait come back come back and as she's running down her slipper grass slipper they call it whatever um falls and she has to keep running so then i think the picture show that she's back home and she's she's just happy that she got to do something um and then they find out that oh boy my brain that there was a screws slip slipper or they're going to find who was that woman who actually would of course have been cinderella and so they go to every unmarried young woman and none of them it doesn't fit right with any of them with the slipper grass slipper i can't talk that with the slipper and um it does for for the cinderella and so she becomes married and i think i missed one thing in there it seems like the the mom ends up breaking that or something first i don't remember that but anyway they find the other one like i say and and that fits it's the only one that that fits right and it's obviously she's she's the one then it shows that they get married and happily ever after i think that's it can you tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly saying sandwich uh yeah you open up each of the each of the like sorry each of the like jellies excuse me it over again peanut butters and jelly oh wait a minute i'm saying the backwards oh yeah okay first i have to get out i can't

particular part or i know i'm have to talk to somebody to describe something i write it down in my my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if i have difficulties with it so that's what i do or my help that's a really great strategy um do you remember your i do because i woke up one morning with a splitting headache okay uh i normally in the

in and uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast and uh while i was there i usually read the first section of the paper and i opened it up and i could not read what was on the newspaper i couldn't see a whole paragraph it blocks of characters were missing all together so that's the first thing so i just i set the uh paper aside and said okay i get home and uh got dressed and went to work i droving driving from work 22 miles from my house to the office and uh what i was seeing on the highway again on the uh dashboard of the car i couldn't see all of the instrumentation on the dash but i able to

uh talked to my boss and told her what was going on she said just take it easy for a while and see if you can later remember and i took half hour 45 minutes and still couldn't so i said all right i just can't do it i'm going to go home i came home took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day that was on a thursday on friday morning i got up and i exercised on friday monday wednesdays and fridays i exercised the group early in the morning so i went to exercise class and um i exercised but when i was with the group i was talking and what i was saying wasn't making

reason because she the change of the cinderella and the family changed dramatically and she became more of a slave than a a sister in the girl and the mother and uh things got worse and worse as she got older and uh one point in time she got acquainted or is that she uh learned to live with the animals in the home and the family or in the house and the outside the home as well and uh they became

we they planned on a uh ball to meet all the eligible girls in the the kingdom and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave not take set brother cinderella and and cinderella had a gown somewhere i think from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but a trunk someplace and she got it out and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters and they ended up tearing it up and she didn't have anything and then the animals that mice and the cats and dogs helped her to uh redo her dress her other uh whatever very god mother there we

normally would go to work i couldn't go to work i told patty that i need to go to the see my doctor and basically at that time the only doctor i was seeing was the heart heart coller uh i'm called a heart doctor and she talked me instead to go to the emergency room went to the emergency room and they discovered that i had a stroke and so they put me in the hospital and uh i was there three days they were trying to basically my heart was out of rhythm and uh beating too passed and lots of different things so they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized and then three more days basically discovering that i had a a stroke and a phasia and then i was went home after the trying to think what another week it was wednesday wednesday i went home and uh thursday i drove back to the drove then buse i could drive i could do everything i needed to do except talk so i went to make an appointment with the uh speech therapy at that point and that's where it started you mind telling me a little bit about that like your recovery so what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke well it started out with something simple because basically i could look at anything know what it was but i couldn't pull the words out and so we started with a simple things like in the room for example looking around the room looking at each object in the room naming it trying to find the the word and say the word out loud so that's where it first started and it built from there just and some of the things we saw looked at just a few minutes ago like with the pictures look at the picture name the picture and over time that gradually got better and better but uh that's where i think the start with the therapy was and then part of my was actually writing my story out and i found when writing taking a paper and pencil and writing i couldn't spell properly anymore and that was something i had to work at so i found that with my keyboard i could do better than i could with a pen and pencil and with uh note word here the same thing it it has a spell checker and a spell uh i'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker but it starts out if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work so that sometimes helped a lot as well writing so uh you i've done a lot of that"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-1_485541_725029.wav", "transcript": " but it's mainly uh working with seeing what a seeing the words and then saying it out loud that's done more i think than anything else and i worked hard at it for a long time and then i took got kind of afterwards i've kind of got a little slow about it or not slow but just having done it as bell as i used to but uh for the first months after the stroke i was i worked hard at it trying to pull those pictures back and i found that it's like learning in school again grade school you look at a word you learn that word and oh that's that word and it comes back and it says back with a phasia doesn't stay there it's it's more like having a an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled you know it's like okay i know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be it's over there instead yeah that type of thing so so thinking back can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life to be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently happy i think when my grandson was born he was a joy to be with and uh i got to spend a lot of time with him when we was little as an infant and uh watching him grow and just that was special he's 10 now and he's doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as i would liked then and he's off doing other things so here are some more pictures that also tell a story take a second to look at them and then whenever you are ready tell me the story that you see with the beginning a middle and an end okay now first of all these uh pictures are under the last four uh story so i can't see what's there there are two ways to fix that um we can click and drag the um our like windows or you can minimize it all right got it all right all right let's do this there we go down below it now okay boys out kicking the soccer ball he kicked it got a little too close and kicked it through the window i'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad but uh window came through the yard and the uh i'd say his dad saw it open looked out the window and noticed who and kicked the ball here are some more pictures they also tell a story so take a second to look at all of them and whenever you are ready tell me the story you see it's a beginning a middle and an end okay in the beginning mom sent little boy out go to school she had he had a backpack"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-1_725074_804705.wav", "transcript": " and he didn't want to cake his umbrella so he said i'll be fine without it all he went out and he went out rain started draining and so he ran back to the house his mom was upset with him for going out without the umbrella and so we got a umbrella and went back out with the umbrella the next time take a second to look at it and whenever you are ready tell me the story that you see with a beginning a middle and an end all right well it looks like the beginning a little girl was riding her bicycle or tricycle and her dog or cat were out in the yard and the dog chased the cat up the tree and so she called back to her dad and said the cats stuck from the tree and he got out of the ladder went out to climb up to get the cat down and the ladder fell and so they had to call a fire and to help him and the cat get down out of the tree so that's pretty much the story"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-2_1400737_1613405.wav", "transcript": " okay all right cinderella story started out when she was a small young girl and her uh apparently her mother died and her father brought home a stepmother and uh they met with when she was young and met with her stepsisters as well uh and as they grew it looked like more and more she was acted as a servant rather than uh a child or a girl in the family as part of the family she was more of a a uh servant and uh so they grew up that way uh and then uh over time she uh got to know the animals in the home horse and the dog and the mice and uh had more of a friends with those than with the other two people uh and then uh as group the uh family or the king in that neighbor neighborhood city whatever uh had a son was grown same time and he decided son needed to uh meet a girl his age and possibly uh don't know what the situation was there but anyway he decided to uh create a ball to bring all the eligible girls in the kingdom in and uh meet them and decide who might uh be his uh girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you want to call it and so uh they sent that invitation out the uh stepmother saw it and planned on taking his daughters but not cinderella cinderella wanted to go as well so she with the help of the uh animals made a build a dress for her a gown and uh showed it to her stepmother and the uh daughter or the sisters and uh they ended up in the damaged it for her so she couldn't wear it"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-2_1613888_1777150.wav", "transcript": " and somehow she got her godmother found out about it and uh helped her get another dress and uh changed and set the uh animals up as uh coach and horses and took her to the ball and while she was at the ball she met the princess the princess prince prince liked her and spent most of the time with her the other people were the girls were jealous uh but they they danced and got along well but she had to leave at midnight and she was running out she lost her one of her slippers as they were leaving it was too late so he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl and uh eventually they found it at their home the uh stepmothers step sisters didn't uh weren't able to fit the mother tried to break the glass slipper and uh they recovered it and they got to the princess or to the cinderella she was able to wear it and show them also the other one that she had so she had those to prove that she was the person that actually had had the slipper and uh and got together with the princess again and lived happily ever after that's it tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich get two pieces of butter or two pieces of bread get jar peanut butter a jar of jelly put put uh peanut butter on one side of the bread on one piece of bread jelly on the other put them to together and peanut butter jelly"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-2_247908_484716.wav", "transcript": " and uh i did that on the computer and was able to do it it took much much longer than normally to do a puzzle but i was able to complete that and then uh had a normal evening went to bed early got up the next day and went to  exercise class with a group that we meet early in the mornings on monday wednesday and friday and this was a friday morning that i'd gone to work on thursday couldn't work so at friday when i got up i went exercise with the group and with the group we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and walk a little bit warm up and while we're walking we talk and visit with each other and uh when i was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what i was saying and what they heard me and what i could hear me didn't make sense as far as the the words that i was uh speaking uh the words were correct but they were not making sense as complete words so i said knew there was something wrong my friends knew there was something wrong so i when i got through the exercise class we spent an hour exercising together i went home and uh had breakfast and i told patty i said there's something wrong i need to to go to the doctor that i wanted her to take me to my heart doctor and she decided that rather than that would take me to the emergency room and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that i had a stroke and so i spent the next three days there was a problem with my heart uh my heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm and so they spent most of the time for the next two or three days correcting that issue and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with the phasia and they discovered the did had a stroke and had a phasia so that's pretty much where i that sounds like it could have been really scary but you just handled it like it was another day well i tried to no i really didn't i thought i had a headache and uh talking with patty later she said on on the wednesday the day before i woke up with a headache she said you had a headache that that day too like wednesday night late i mentioned that i had a headache then so i don't remember that well that part of it so do you still play sudokus yes yes i do very nice my uh grandpa got me into the sadokus his name is actually also jerry so that's a kind of a fun fact connection yeah yeah"}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-2_498523_729147.wav", "transcript": " well i think the best thing that happened was uh i got a great therapy and uh she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction it's finding what uh needed to be done and then working with me to uh get that but basically i went therapy three times a week for server months and then drop down to couple times a week and uh we uh until finally i reached a point where the standard test that they did for us for you i'd already done all of them and uh reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it so uh yeah but uh starting i got a squirrel running across my uh patio but never mind i'll let go of that one uh but uh part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the that we saw with all the drawings of different things i had the same thing sitting in a go in a room sit in here look around and name each object i see in that room and uh say it out loud and until i can figure you sometimes you know you know all these words you know all these items but you don't not able to pull those words out and the same thing driving down the street you look at uh say a mailbox say say that word out loud mailbox post stop uh you know and uh hedges whatever whatever you see make a name bring a name for that item and it's something that i've kept along with all the as long as i've had a s phasia now when i look at something i'll say the name of that item just to keep keep it going and so that's uh one of the things i do all the time i don't even think about it a lot of times it's just something automatic to do here are some more pictures they also tell a story so take a second to look at them and then tell me whatever story that you see the beginning a middle and end okay the boy was out playing in the yard kicking his soccer ball he kicked his soccer about a little too hard in the wrong way and it hit a window and broke the window fell through right next to a lamp inside the house and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor i'm not sure who this person is whether it's his father or his neighbor and then the uh adult was watching out of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and uh broke his window do you think he's looking out angrily or uh you think he's just curious well at this point we don't see his face"}, {"filename": "tucson16a_48346_50816.wav", "transcript": " and i i got a little bit

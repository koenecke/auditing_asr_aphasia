[{"filename": "kurland25b_378819_459908.wav", "transcript": "It was a terribly busy day here in Woodbrook. The cat had treed itself in the early afternoon. And young Polly was trying very hard to get the cat treed before it tried to get even farther into the tree itself. Dad attempted to get the tree too, but he really was a little old and fidgety. And he couldn't get out and get the tree himself. He couldn't get the tree together for himself. So there was no point of trying to get the ladder, because Dad just couldn't get it up, and there it was. The dog was, of course, as dogs always do, began to bark and bark furiously, which, of course, made the cat even more perturbed. By this time, they had to actually call a fireman to get the cat back. And the thing had a happy ending with a twittering bird."}, {"filename": "wozniak03a_497819_504109.wav", "transcript": ""}, {"filename": "kurland23a_2170444_2175954.wav", "transcript": "I know I'm sorry you're listening to this horrible story, this horrible story."}, {"filename": "scale17a_701301_705896.wav", "transcript": "Yes, so, so."}, {"filename": "Baycrest10450a_341750_345223.wav", "transcript": "what all of these, what this is about."}, {"filename": "elman14a_2140047_2143167.wav", "transcript": ""}, {"filename": "kansas05a_146120_149056.wav", "transcript": "and there was nothing to me.

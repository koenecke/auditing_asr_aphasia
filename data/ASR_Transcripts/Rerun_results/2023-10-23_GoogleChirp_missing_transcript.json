So I went to, I stopped at a a doctor's office and they couldn't see me, so I stopped at a and here's another thing I try not to remember what it's called, but it's it's not the hospital eer, it's it's a another ER, you can just, it's, but anyway, so I stopped at that ER, they looked me over, they said, you've probably got a virus or something, you can you can cuz then they took my blood pressure and all that, I drove. I was wasn't having trouble driving, I even remember I was sitting playing on my phone while I was waiting for them to take me in, and they they gave me medication, I went home and laid down, and then apparently I must have texted some friends and said, I don't feel well, that's about all I really remember. I was told after the fact that a friend of mine stopped over and I must have said I don't feel well, and he called the ER I had gone to and they said, oh, it's probably the medication should. is taking, just stop taking that and she'll be fine, so they waited, well he waited a few more hours, i guess i started throwing up or something, and then he took me to the to the hospital emergency and they immediately ship me to, i don't remember any of that stuff, so i was told i was there for five days, i only vakely remember some of that, and then stuff i can start to remember is when i was brought back and i stayed there for 10 days and pretty much most of that i remember remember, but I guess again, I couldn't read at all at that point, I could speak, but a lot of words I, you know, people could kind of understand what I was saying, but I couldn't always say what I was trying to say."

Wonderful, I know. Thankfully, that's never happen. Never did that to my mom. Yeah, cuz whether whether that's the parent or just the owner of the house, it's probably not very happy. I know, I don't know what I would be more scared of if it was my neighbor. Yeah, I know, and I guess technically from this we can't tell the person is. Um, all right, and then here's another photo for the same thing, it tells a story with the beginning, a middle and end. so just look at the photos and talk. All right, what I'm guessing from this is the child is getting ready to leave for school from his home, and I would say his mother is saying you should take an umbrella. And I'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella and so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella. He gets part way to school and it starts pouring. so I'm assuming he's unhappy that he's soaking wet and looks like."

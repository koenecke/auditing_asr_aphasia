I remembered so said, let's go for our therapy. Now, let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, we started working on therapy and they said, you have aphasia. um, andBy talking, I couldn't say pretty much any. I couldn't say anything. They were saying like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me like a cup. You want something to drink. They take the cup and show me, and I go yes or no. It took me a even harder to understand that. This goes this way. If you want it, if you don't want it, it goes this way.

Like my dad, let me, we have a row boat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the motor in the back and it may, you were not allowed to go fast. It was like, too, like Five. No five. Fast. So it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the, you know, the boat. But they let me actually mow it that like that.

And so then I don't remember how long they've been there maybe a year or so and she she came back to town and a relative on his side. Had a baby and she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled. She wanted to hold that baby in. She just remember, I took a picture with that baby, and I thought she just looks so natural with that baby. Like she's held them all her life and she told me I really want one now and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing babies, she lost it two or three and then when she had this one,and maybe about six months in, I'm in Indiana and she's in Florida and I'm nesting.

I remember that because I had right side weakness in the blankets just felt really heavy and so IReally had to work at it to lift the blankets as it was, like, they were full of bricks or something. And so I got them off when I just really focused on it. and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom, the next room over was too far for me to walk.

And so, I avoided talking to him when all possible and so, but this guy was,kind of, The boxes pet and so I'll just call him. And when I use my cell phone, I had that guys. Cell phone number and desk number. But I thought sure I selected the desk number because it was really not even wanting to talk to him either, but I thought I'll just leave him a message. Well, he answered the phone. And so it had to be before 8 o'clock because I was really surprised. He answered the phone and I said to him. BrianYou're at work already. And he said, no, you called me on my cell phone or what's up? And I said, well, my brain's not working right today, so I'm not going to come in and I chose those words carefully. I didn't want them to know there was a health issue. But I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not coming in and I certainly needed to make that call. and,So he took it as a humorous and I was fine with that. It was kind of why I said it the way I did. And as a side note of when I came back to work, he recalled that conversation. He said I really didn't understand. What? You're trying to tell me and I said, no, Brian, I wasn't trying to tell you anything. I was I was not this was not a call for help. I already had in my mind what I was going to do, but I just needed to let you guys. I know I wasn't going to be here. And so he was real relieved to hear that and so I felt bad when he said that I was like oh gospel the guilt. This guy's carrying around for nothing you know.

But, um, it was like 10 days. They finally got me in there to, um, I finally started, I mean, I could actually talk or anything like that. Um, but I had to remember how to remember everything and we're, everything is gone back. I mean, everything about, um, ABC, all that kind of stuff. I can, everybody's name everybody, the computer on there, the, the coke in there, everything, the wrong about it. You have nothing about it. You have to remember everything about it. So, um, we, um, went to, I had like 30 30 days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first time. And then, um, we went to, um, after that, that's when we started to talk into, um, getting the, so the thing make sure don't forget something 10 years before. Um, but we did start like, um, ABC 123 or something like that with my mom started to, um, it's in, um, um, hooks. I went there, there was someone we got to talk over there and she talked to me all the time about, remember how you start about everything, getting all ABC 123 and stuff like that. Um, and it took a long time. It's about a year to start over that. And I've gone down, it was Monday to Friday. Now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that, there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks. Just try to talk a little better on that because I mean, at this time I could talk a little better, but it's just hard to get back everything out of there. So that helps different things about it for those six weeks. How you're trying to the computer, trying to try to write on there, trying to do something about it, get a little better there. And that's how they try to after that they started IU and that's when they um started with noun verb proposition, all those kind of things like that. Um There's so much you couldn't remember anything about it. Um But it's, you just take your time trying to me, me and my mom, my mom helps with me all the time, still trying to rewrite everything. So I can't. But if you had to rewrite things about it after you do that, you do very good about those things, but then you forgot about the other things you get back. So it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time. So you just got to keep everything, keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing and they talk to me real quick. This is kind of weird because if one person talking to me kills me, if there's three people, I can understand other people, I can understand what it is. But so it takes time. I'm getting around everything. So, um, so it's just, it keeps going every year and still looking at just getting a little better. Um, I don't know how long I can go but it's just, it seems like I'm still doing something with it. So, um, and it keeps going over time. So, so I try to ride every day, all kinds of stuff I can.

And, uh, that was my first sign, something was wrong at first I thought because I had the two cats and I thought they were laying on the covers or something. But, uh, they, that, you know, the room was dark and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my mind. And finally they came off and then I, um, start to take some steps. The bathroom was the next room over and I was, um, finding that I was exhausted and I decided I would just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. Uh, I don't know why I didn't think you just get back in the bed, but I just laid on the floor, uh, I laid there for about 30 minutes. Um, my Garman told me what was going on the timeline. And, uh, so when I got back up, I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom. So I didn't just crawl back in the bed. And, uh, then about, um, I was awake asleep back and forth till about eight o'clock And I was trying to figure out something is wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major and I was trying to decide it probably something wrong with my brain or my heart. And, um, I didn't want to go to the emergency room and there'd be nothing wrong. Uh, but I called, uh, a guy from work. I used my phone and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number. So I want to leave him a voicemail message and I was surprised to hear him answer and that's when he told me you called my cell number. So I worked for a very difficult company to work for and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on. So I kind of jokingly told them something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified. I wouldn't be in that day. And I said, uh, pass the word on my brain's not working right today. I won't be in and so he just juggled and said, well, ok, I'll pass that on and then I called a friend and, uh, told him what was going on. And, uh, then between two of us we decided, um, um, well, my, my idea I will call him a half hour if you don't hear from me, call me if you can't reach me, call for help. So, uh, half hour later I called him and, uh, I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did, my neighbor next door came and got me and um, we went to the hospital. I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one. We got of four hospitals to choose from. So I don't really know why or remember why we went to that one.

But, uh, for the first, but after the stroke I was, I worked hard at it trying to pull those pictures back and I found that, you know, it's like learning him school again, grade school, you look at a word and you learn that word and, oh, that's that word and it comes back and it stays back with aphasia. It doesn't stay there. It's, it's more like having a, an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled. You know, it's like, ok, I know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be, it's over there instead, you know, that type of thing. So, so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life to be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently happy, I think when my grandson was born, he was a joy to be with.

He's 10 now and he's doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as I would like them and he's off doing other things.

Now, first of all these, uh, the pictures are under the last for, uh, the story. So I can't see what's there. There are two ways to fix that. Um, we can click and drag the, um, are like windows or you can minimize it. All right. Got it. All right. Let's do this. There we go down below it now. Ok, boys out kicking a soccer ball. He kicked it, got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad, but the window came through the yard and, uh, yeah, I'd say his dad site open, looked out the window and noticed who they kicked them off. Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story. So take a second to look at all of them. And whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see, it's a beginning, a middle and an end. Ok.

They'll keep it so it'll make it good for you too. But then the aunt was very nice. She made her pretty bad.

They got to do whatever they wanted and they're kind of in the, but, um, but, um, so that's how it was for all the time. She tried to be nice but they were still not very nice. But, um, the one time they're gonna have, they were, I guess they do for the, some time of the year they get to see everybody. So they went to, um, see if this would be, see their, their aunt took the two girls to make sure they're gonna find their, one of the, the boy, the great boy is one of those that comes there. Um, so they're gonna go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that. But their cousin didn't know she's supposed to be there. But a, um, um, would you say, um, not a ghost or something? I don't know. But they had one that would bring on the way that's not normal how the, um, people and still again, it was totally different how they flew in here. I got them but they gotta hold her and got her some different clothes and stuff like that so she could go in that way. Um, so she got to go in that place and, um, went to see there that night. Got up, you go, um, sing and play or was out there? Got some people and that's where they saw the big, uh, it's one of the, I think he's, um, I don't know if he is the king or he might be just the new king coming there.

But then, um, while they're there, he did, he did bring him over to her and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes. So he knew what it was.

I have to cut into your, cut into your skull and, uh, and go in there and we'll take that or fix that will actually seal it off. And, uh, and it would be good as good as new.

They were trying to, basically, my heart was out of rhythm and, uh, beating too fast and lots of different things.

So, what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke? Well, it started out with something simple because basically I could look at, at anything, know what it was, but I couldn't pull the words out. And so we started with the simple things like in the room, for example, looking around the room, looking at each object in the room, naming it, trying to find the, the word and say the word out loud, you know, so that's where it first started and it built from there, you know, just and some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago, you know, like with the pictures, you know, look at the picture, name the picture and over time that gradually got better and better. But that's where I think the start with the therapy was. And then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing, uh taking a paper and pencil and writing, I couldn't spell it properly anymore. And so that was something I had to work at. So I found that with my keyboard, I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with a notebook here, you know, the same thing. It, it has a spell checker and a spell. Uh, not, I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker, but it starts out, you know, if you start the first few characters of a word, it gives you several different words that work.

I was, uh, I was, I was, I've been working on, uh, on doing some carpenter work in the house and, uh, I started to feel, um, I started to feel kind of numb in my right hand. Um, I didn't feel too bad but I knew from what people had told me or I heard that many times. The, one of the signs of the stoke is a numbness. In fact, I remember I was, uh, a, a fellow that I used to work with at a stroke at work. I remember going through that and, uh, kind of recognized from that and how it looked. Um, so, iii I knew what was going on. I knew I was having a stroke, um, against my, well, I probably, I shouldn't have done it, but I, I called Sharon and I said, uh, you probably need to come home. Um, I'm gonna head, I'm gonna go to the hospital, I don't feel right. You know, I'm not sure what's going on but I'm better. Yeah, just come on home and, uh, I said, I'm, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna head to the hospital. Just come on down to the emergency room when you, when you get here. So I, I did, I went out and I got in my truck and I headed for the, went to the hospital which isn't very far away. It's about six or eight blocks away from here. And, um, I drove to the hospital and, uh, dove into the emergency room parking and, uh, walked into the, uh, he walked into the hospital and I said, I'm, I'm, I think I'm having a stroke and they, you know, didn't waste any time said, ok, you know, we come on, come back. Well, we're gonna take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They, it took me, put me in one of them examination rooms and, um, they started to examine me, uh, Sharon, uh, she was about a half hour away. So she got there after this had started that the, the ex, uh, express, I think, I, I think I, they already taken me to, uh, to get AC T scan or whatever it was. Uh, well, before she got there. So they, they, when, when, when she got there, I was already had gone into, uh, to get a scan and um, so when they had, when I was done with that, they took me, uh, uh, back into the, waiting, back into the room where I was the treatment room, whatever you call it at, at the, in the emergency room. And, uh, I, I remember pretty well that, uh, you know, Sharon was there and, and, uh, I remembered, I knew what was going on, uh, at that, that I had a stroke but I felt like it was probably, it wasn't getting any worse, it was just struggling.

I looked at it and I couldn't get the words. I could, I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words. And I, what I did get to read, I didn't understand. So I tried for a couple of days and I thought, what the heck with this? I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days, I'm sitting there and I thought you were gonna learn to read that paper and I started reading it. Now I read a paper and it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning when I got up after I, you know, into the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there and I'd think of my daughter's family. There's four people in the family, there's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name but I couldn't get his name out. And the two boys and I would just close my eyes and visualize it. And gradually all of a sudden I'd see their names and gradually it would come. Then I went with my oldest son with his family. It was tiring. And I did that at night too. When I went to bed before I went to sleep, I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother and all that and it was a long time, but it, it worked, it really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day, I said, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me. I says I am so tired and I says, I don't do anything. She says, mom, you are doing a whole lot. I said such as what he says, all I'm doing is thinking about this one and thinking about, well, that's it. She says you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it. But um it all came. It's just now I, I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out. And that, and when I write, it's getting better sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything and all of a sudden I look at it and I thought, no, that's not that word. And the first time I saw that was when I made my first, uh, when I was going to the store, my little shopping thing I needed, uh, mayonnaise. So I'm writing and writing. I get to the store and I came to that word. I couldn't figure out what it was that it wasn't even making any kind of sense and I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back now I had to think what was I gonna do with this. Then I knew what it was. It would come, I'd forget it again.

And, uh, you know, when I first met him, I'm just seeing this skinny teenager with acne and I'm thinking he's just full of hormones. He's like, uh, this is the last thing I want around my daughter. I got enough trouble with her. Uh, well, anyway, uh, they eventually got married and then, uh, but she was determined she didn't want any kids. She was so sure she would screw them up and, uh, it's just too hard and so me and my husband will just, you know, we'll just see the world and they did, they did a lot of traveling and everything and, um, and I had a, just, and I have a son too but he didn't seem to have any, uh, interest in getting married or having kids or anything.

And so, um, then I don't remember how long they've been there, maybe a year or so. And uh she, uh, she came back to town and a relative on his side had a baby and she wanted to hold that baby and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby and she just, I remember I took a picture of her with that baby and I thought she just looks so natural with that baby, like she's held them all her life. And, uh she told me I really want one now. And so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing babies. She lost two or three.

But, but it's tough to keep doing. And, um, I got adult coloring books, uh, because of a high fine motor skill issues with my right hand. And, um, I went to a teacher supply store and, uh got some kids reading and math workbooks uh for, look like about a third or fourth grade. That's where I estimated my level was at, at the time. And so, um, because when I looked at higher grades like 5th and 6th, I was like, I can't begin to even do this stuff. But third or fourth, it was like, ok, this is a little bit of a reach for me. Let me start here. And so I did that and, um, I got puzzle books for kids um to do. And so I did those and, um, I always did like to cook before, but now I had a, um special interest in cooking healthy food and I wanted to be food that tasted good. And, uh, so, um, I got some healthy uh recipes and uh, worked on those and ice. So I was surprised to see that I struggled with um, uh conversions like a jar of garlic, half a teaspoon is one clove. And when the recipe called for two cloves, I struggled with that. I was like, and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon. So I did two half cheese spoons because I knew that would work.

Um, I, you know, I could talk, um, I couldn't, um, do anything and interestingly in July. So that was, that was, that was May in July middle of July somewhere. I had another joke and they, I was, at that point I was in a, uh, I was in a, a rehabilitation center, the rehab hospital and they, uh, it took me, uh, my ambulance because I, I felt I could feel that something was going on and I was afraid it was a stroke but I couldn't say it, it was a stroke.

Oh, and the other thing that had happened to me was I lost uh my ability to focus my eyes together. So I can only see out of one eye at a time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side and I had to wear it for a while over the side. And then, you know, but I currently have my open that time because I couldn't see, um with both sides, I can still with both eyes but, and see different, different things. And so, um, when I had the second stroke or when his third stroke in the hospital, um I, the vision started clear up and I remember telling me I said my vision is getting better. I can see better. I can focus, I can focus with my eyes. And, um, and I, it turned out I could, and then I also told her that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit. And you know, because when you're, when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not, you think you're moving it? But it, it really isn't. And I said, you know, look at my leg and see if it's moving. And uh because I really felt like it was and indeed it was moving, it was moving.

So she's running and um, I'm sure even the one of the guys who worked there even had a, a question and she, I think she said I gotta go.

She's a, you know, and they are, they were the bourgeoisie at the place and I said fine and there's just no, no. Yeah, in her being here fortunately for a Cinderella who would have been no doubt weeping for, for the, the misery of not being at the at the castle.

And it's shown that they're all very, very mean, not only to, to Cinderella but even to themselves. They just, they're just very, all they think about is uh themselves and the, the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money when she gets married. So they realized that Cinderella. It's just a very beautiful person. I mean, she's, she's very, she's very pretty and beautiful, but she's inside, she's just a really sweet person who, who cares about people. So, the uh oh, I think it's called stepmother. I think that's what it's called. Um realizes they need to, she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing, working with her daughters. And so Cinderella is life changed from going through a very happy, wonderful life to be in what could be a terrible life because all that she's can do is constantly clean and wash and whatever else she has to do, cook for the other three people. But yet during that time, Cinderella still stays somehow, basically happy. Um at least for the most part and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them.

Uh, that is so significant to me because I remember I could not read that word. I knew what the word was but I couldn't say it to save my life. Um, but, well, I could say it, I just couldn't read it. And, uh, so I pointed and I said emergency. And so I wasn't reading it, you know, it was like, it's red and I just know what that word is because it's red. And then, so we got to the entrance and there was like, uh, I wanna say a canopy but not really a canopy, uh, but something to keep you out of the rain and, um, overhang or whatever. Um, and I caught the eye of a policeman that was, uh, sitting or standing there. His job is to check people for weapons before they get into the hospital. And, uh, I waited him and motion for him to come and he did. And I told him, uh, I think I've had a stroke and I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility. I don't even remember. But, but, uh, and I said, but I'm afraid to walk and I was walking fine, but I just never had a stroke before. So I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now and all of a sudden I can't, you know, I didn't know. So I was afraid to walk. And, uh, so he said, hold on, I'm gonna get someone and the nurse came out real fast and she brought out, um, she came out first and then, uh, I told the same thing to her and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair. I think it was just inside the door. And so she got me in the wheelchair and we went in and, um, I remember looking at the people in the waiting room, it was pretty full and I felt kind of guilty because I was being rushed to the head of the line and I almost wanted to say sorry, but I think I had a stroke but, you know, just not appropriate to really say anything. I just felt bad. And then, so then, uh, the intake person wanted my health insurance card. So I gave her that and, uh, this, she asked me, am I on any medications? And I remembered, uh, the Met Foreman but I called it glue, I think is, I think that's the name brand for it. But I couldn't think of Matt Foreman and, uh, there were a lot of, uh, supplements I used to take and, uh, maybe a couple more meds.

So I did get to remember. I had to start up another time. So it did help. Um, I mean, my mom helped me and, um, different places. They, they helped everything about it, but it's nice to get back up, um, where you can go the bottom. I mean, it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down. I go up and you had another time to keep getting better than you were. Um, so it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that, it helps, um, a lot better. Yeah. Now I'm going to show you these pictures. Um, again, just take a little time to look at them, they tell a story, take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story and you can start whenever you are ready. Ok, the boy was out outside with the, with the soccer ball he's kicking around and he kicked one really good. Um, but it hit right in the middle of the window on the, on the house there. Um, so the next one over there, her looks like her dad, kind of, you might have been sleeping and jumped out pretty good when the, the soccer ball went, went through the window into the house and the lamp broke down there too. Um, but you really can't tell on number four, I can't see what the, with my picture on you and, and, and they're all on. I can't see what number four is on there. Really? If you click um, on my face, there should be a way to move the box to where you can see four. Um Which one are you saying? So if you click on this small screen with my face on it, if you click it and drag view options. Um, no, just like actually on my face, there should be a little, your cursor should change. They on the top or the bottom um, in the middle, click open and then you can drag it and move the box. Hm. Good idea here. I'm just saying sure you are. Hey mom, you want where you want to move this. So you know how to move this out of the way because I can't see the last one here. Hold on a minute, you'll click on the window with my face on it and drag it across the screen, click it, click here and then drag it across. Uh, I got you. Um, it looks like he is not very happy because he got his own soccer ball. Um, but he's still looking out there and I think the, the boy must have ran away, he ran away.

Um So I did that and I worked hard on that and I, I worked hard. Uh when I, when I, when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me. Uh I went to the Y MC A and I got a membership in the Y and, and hired at the Y A uh personal trainer. 00, didn't really know anything about Stokes but she learned, she was very good at studying and learning the first time that she saw me. Uh and I, I was so stiff that, that I couldn't move. I, I couldn't move my arm was just, I don't know if you can see it here. It's, you know, your arm is like this and it, and it's clenched fist and everything. And the first time she tried to move my arm, it was like holy cow. I, I can't move it, you know, and it would move. She worked with me. Uh I went twice a week to go with her uh, and then in addition to that, um, but, but after a while I went started, I'd say she take me down to the wine. Let me, uh, I was, I was still using my walker. I'd say let me just take me down the line and let me walk around the track with my walker and I'm sure people felt thus stupid. You know, here's this, this old guy walking around with, you know, very, very slowly. Take me, you know, take me up it, it's a 66 times around the track for a mile and it would take me, uh for a half hour to walk around that lap. And, but I was, I was determined to do it and I did it, I did it. And, um, then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane. I still go very slowly. Uh I'm doing it. So I'm gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself and I'm not trying to pat pat myself on the back. I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have and I'm sorry for them. They don't. But, and I think, I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive. I did not lose my drive. I always, I've always been kind of driven anyway. You know, I've always been driven, but I was driven to her too improve and get better.

But basically I, with therapy three times a week for several months and then dropped down to a couple of times a week. And uh we, uh until finally I reached the point where the standard test that they did for us or, you know, I already done all of them and uh reached the point where they couldn't go any further with it. So, uh, yeah, but uh starting, I've got a squirrel running across my uh patty, but never mind, I'll let go of that one. But uh part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the, that we saw with all the drawings of different things. I had the same thing sitting in a go in a room, sitting in here, look around and name each object I see in that room and uh say it out loud, you know, until I can figure, you know, sometimes, you know, you know, all these words, you know, all these items, but you don't, not able to pull those words out. And the same thing driving down the street, you look at, uh, say a mailbox, say, say that word out loud mailbox and post, uh, you know, and, uh, hedges, whatever, you know, whatever you see, make a name, you know, bring a name for that item and it's something that I've kept along with all that. As long as I've had a sort of aphasia now is, you know, when I look at something, I'll say the name of that item just to keep, keep it going, you know. So that's, uh, one of the things I do all the time. I, I don't even think about it a lot of times it's just something automatic to do. Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story. So take a second to look at them and then tell me whatever story that you see the beginning and middle and end. Ok. The boy was out playing the new yard, kicking a soccer ball, he kicked his soccer ball a little too hard in the wrong way and it hit a window and broke the window fell through right next to our land inside the house and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor. I'm not sure who this person is, whether it's his father or, and then the, uh, adult was watching out of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broke his window. Do you think he's looking out angrily or, uh, do you think he's just curious?

They were more into that at the very beginning than other, like, um, aphasia type stuff. They want to make sure I was able to, to walk again. And because my one side of my, um, body was starting to have trouble, they said, so they wanted to start using your hands and your arm and walk around to be able to do all that. At the beginning, they started doing some little task for me, like, um, we played cards to see how many cards I can find, looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that. But we were doing that just here and there feeling. Um, I was also very sad, very, um, emotional feeling didn't, I couldn't even remember who I was. And so, um, getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are. I was more panicked than that kind of stuff. Um, once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year two, days I figured out how people were that I remembered. So, um, said, let's go for our therapy. Now, let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, um, we started working on therapy and, um, they said you have aphasia. Um, and my talking, I couldn't say pretty much any, I couldn't say anything. They were saying like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me like a cup. Do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me and I go yes or no. It took me to help even harder to understand that. This goes this way if you want it, if you don't want it, it goes this way, it took that long to figure that out. Little things like that that I didn't remember. Um, then once I was able to at least think a little bit more, we started with um, uh, pictures like that bird and the, and the boy and the banana. And uh we start, that was our therapy starting was the fact that being able to say certain words. And um my first name took me about another year to be able to say my last name, my kids and everything else. So still working on therapy myself, I have a, a book at home that I still do my homework every day. So still going. It's I, I'm um, the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write. And I said, but I told myself that I'm going to do it. So I'm not done yet when it comes to, to coming up. So, you know, I'm going to read someday and I will write and I will have numbers at some point. So, yeah, um, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life?

And, uh, it's, it's quite a bit of rain because as he, as he runs he's, he's uh, splashing So there's enough rain that's making, making no spices and he's uh kind of holding his hand up over his head. Like as though he's gonna be able to stop the water off his head. You run to and uh you can tell say the mom is a little, little uh perturbed but yet because he wouldn't take the umbrella. So there, there he is all wet, head to toe wet, dripping wet. And the mom just kind of looked at him like you, you know, you, you should listen to what he said. I said, ok, I'm oh OK. So give me the umbrella. So she gives him the umbrella and head, head heads back to school and uh yeah, it's still raining. So raining pretty hard uh coming down at an angle even more of an angle.

And then I showed her a 30 ft long, uh, ladder, um, that I bought one a couple of days before that for 100 and $50 or less. And, uh, then I started driving, like I said, on Boston Road and I was going to, um, you know, you know, um, Chicago to supper and, um, Grace looked at me and she said, um, turned right and then try to put on your brakes and I wasn't going very fast anyway. So I managed to, like, not hit anything and I managed to turn white and, uh, I pulled off on the side of the road and, uh, I put on the brakes and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel, like, uh, what's going on and then, um, and that was, that was, I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor and they all could see something was happening and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground. Yeah. Um, and somebody, somebody with a smartphone called up, um, an ambulance and, uh, they said you're going to the hospital and, uh, after that it took me a long time before I could say, um, something more than that. And, um, you know, I was saying to myself, um, I said, obviously I feel pretty good and they're taking me to, uh, using an ambulance and they're taking me to the hospital at Bay State. And, uh, obviously there must be something wrong with me or also I wouldn't be going to a hospital in once and then I tried to say something to grace and then I couldn't say anything and then I couldn't say the right words.

And I think you were pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed. And I remember all of those memories on the fact that uh, um, all the fun things that we were able to do. Like my dad, let me, um, we have a row boat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the, um, motor in the back and it, now you were not allowed to go fast. It was like two, what I call it like five, no, five fast. So it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the, you know, the boat. But, um, they let me actually mow it that like that. And for me being old enough not to drive, I could use that, that paddle boat and stuff like that. I love to, um, to drive. I just thought that was really cool. I'm not sure why now it was like, it was such a big thing, but it was, you know, and I was by myself on the boat, you know, I thought it was something else, you know, and all that, we forgot the gas one time and we had to roll back stuff like that when I was a kid. But I think that was, and at night, um, we had a, we had like a, uh, a place to lay down outside and we would, um, go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty. And I, I think, um, when I have my, if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that light cottage. I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bad nights to go to bed.

And it became rather troubling to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain injured in those years. So there's no therapy, you just, you are able to survive as to what you're able to just get this check from hospital go. Um And uh um and they just did not do therapy in those years and, and over the course of the next 20 years, uh wife and I found out about um from people that had had therapy, brain injuries later that the uh uh divorce rate amongst a brain injured approaches 90%. And the suicide rate of links to brain injury is 4 to 5 times. The national average is what they're telling people even 15 years ago. Um And so I wanted to, to, I wanted to share that with with uh patients at Rhi uh just to give them hope that uh um that recovery is recovery is possible, but it just takes a long time. And in four, when I started there at Rhi, uh it was, I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families a year to year and half, cover year to year and after cover year to year and after recovery, hey, you don't stop recovering. The rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty radically after a year to a year and a half, but you never, never stop recovering. Uh I had a in the 80 80 84 incident, I had a, a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip and it was just something that I accepted and it was like a pun at it, you know, no big deal but to, to stick a pin there man. No wouldn, wouldn't feel it. Uh No, no big deal. And then it was probably, I believe five years ago or 2025. I think it was. Yeah, I think it was 09, 25 years after the 84 incident, I was in the, in the bedroom putting my socks socks one morning and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for 25 years. So what I'm, what I'm telling you actually is that the recovery may slow down, like I say, and mathematically describes asymptotic but, but still slowed down significantly.

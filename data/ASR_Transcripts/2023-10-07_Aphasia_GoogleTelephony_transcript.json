And and so I'm trying to think of who how that happened that they ended up having but oh, they kept Cinderella at home and was weeping and doing all those things and thenGetting ready but I don't know what. Now I can't remember why the the why they about the lose? Somebody off the boat her going. It must have been a fairy godmother. Somebody came along and said that to get her on there as well. And when she did and she had this lovely shoes and and dressed the that the Godmother brought and off.And so she went to the ball and she was so beautiful and the sister. These sisters did not care for her at all, and then, but I know the, the fairy godmothers said that she had to be home by midnight and she was having such a wonderful time and all of a sudden, she realized she'd better go and she was in the trash can, right? So she goes into the pumpkin butt in her her but she was getting out of there. She lost one of his shoes and he the the prince. See, he was looking for a wife and queen for his back, his for his castle. Anyways, so he went away and oh, I think really this this thing offUgly sisters, they didn't want to. They didn't realize that it was her. Because she, I mean, she usually as in wrecks, but anyway, she goes home. She took it into the other, the her old clothes, and, and then he really starts the truth. And of course, the sisters descent stage sisters. Try to remember. They want to fit in that shoe because then the prince will think it's her or him off. And they, they cannot just they have big feet. And they eventually in the background is is Cinderella and suck on checks. The, the foot they said, oh you know, she didn't have to do that, but she did and sure enough, she she the birth.Foot fit into that shoe and she had the other one and she she found the prince and lived happily ever after."

The boy was out outside with the, with the soccer ball, he's kicking around and he kicked on a really good, but he hit right in the middle of the window on the on the house. They're dead. So the next one over there looks like a dab might have been sleeping and jumped out pretty good when the the Packer bowl and went through the window into the house.And a lamp broke down there, too. but you really can't tell a number for, I can't see what the my picture and you, and And I can't see what number four is on there, really? if you click on my face, there should be a way to move the box to where you can see.For which one you saying. So if you click on this, small screen with my face on it off, if you click it and drag the options know just like actually on my face, there should be a little, your cursor should change it on the top or the bottom. Um, in the middle.Click and then you can drag it and move the Box. Good idea here. Interesting. Show you how hey, Mom new one, where you want to move this? You how to move this out of the way cuz I can't see the last one here.You'll click on the window with my face on it and drag it across the screen page here and then dragged it across this. I got you. It looks like he is not very happy cuz he got his soccer ball. But he's still looking out there. I think the, the boy must have ran away. He ran away, so cuz he still look and see what he's doing."

Doctor says, well, you've got a choice. You can either use on a weekend which is a bad time Fridays. And he says you have a choice. You can either go home for the weekend and come back Monday or you can stay over the weekend and when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything, they're not going to say, oh I'll stay at the hospital especially on a weekend.

I don't think Mom should be by herself. So because I had two grandsons and they were little so long.The father came up and it was a good thing. He did because I started fall apart. I cried just like that and I just wouldn't stop crying. And then all of a sudden I sleep, I'd sleep for hours and I didn't realize that. And then we went the weekend, we went to doctors and wage.

So you just gotta keep everything.Team where you're getting things are doing there and still won't be able to work talk. Mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much we would have no idea what I'm doing and they talk to me real quick. This is kind of weird because one person talked me off, if there's three people, I can understand other people like entertainment, what it is. But so it takes time I'm getting around everything so long.so it's just keeps going every year and still again just getting a little better and Don't know how long I can go but it's just it seems like I'm still doing something but it keeps going over time. So so I try to write every day and see if I can page. And just my mom's very helping that my sisters look up a little bit there to, they needed to do something like that and I have my brothers, too."

This particular person but he did and that person had a couple A couple, sorry, a couple like daughters that she owned and it's showing that they're all very, very mean.Not only to to Cinderella but even to themselves they just they're just very all they think about is themselves and the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money. When she gets married. So, They realized that Cinderella is just a very beautiful person. I mean she's she's Drive she's very pretty and beautiful but she's a side she's just a really sweet person who who cares about people?So the oh, I think it's called stepmother.

Because all that she's can do is constantly.Clean and wash and whatever else she has to do cook for the other three people. but yet during that time, Cinderella still stays somehow. Basically happy at least for the most part and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them. And so dead, around that time.The. Prince.

Somehow one of them got got missed and so it was about a month, I guess later.Yeah, yeah, July 11. Forgot to say it. Bottom line is one of them call. Not long before.

But anyway, so I stopped at that, ER, they looked me over. They said you've probably got a virus or something, you can cook, my blood pressure and all that. I grew up, I was wasn't having trouble driving. I even remember, I was sitting playing on my phone while I was waiting for them to take me in and they they gave me medication.

I was told after the fact that a friend of mine stopped overI must have said, I don't feel well and he called the ER and gone to and they said oh it's probably the medication, she's taking just stopped taking that and she'll be fine.

Wonderful, I know, thankfully, that's never happened. He's never did that to my mom. Yeah, whether or not, I don't know what I would be more scared of if it was my neighbor.

I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better off, but probably not because there wasn't anything work withI know I couldn't talk, I couldn't do anything and interestingly month in July. So that was, that was as Meg in July middle of July somewhere ahead. Another joke. And they was at that point, I was in a, in a Rehabilitation Center rehab hospital and they took me by ambulance, because I, I felt I could feel that somebody who was going on and I was afraid it was dark. I could see the stroke. I knew there was something going on and sharing could communicate with me. Well enough to know that there's a problem, could take me to the hospital and I did scans and so forth and sure enough. I did I did this joked.While I was there in the hospital. Up until that time I could not move my legs at all my hands. I I wouldn't know it couldn't do anything with it. You know, just moved. That's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything yet. But while I was in the hospital, I started.being able to move in the other thing that happened to me was at lost my ability to focus my eyes together so I can really see that one out of time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side then we're for a while over the side and you know practically have come on I open that time because I couldn't see With both sides exterior, both eyes but she did different things. And so when I had the second stroke or whether the third stroke in the hospital,Division, started trap. And you remember telling me down Sharon, I said my vision is getting better. I can see better. I can focus, I can focus my eyes and and it turned out I could. And then I also told her that that thought I could start move my leg a little bit odd, you know, there's when you're when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not, you think you're moving it, but it really isn't. And I said, you know how long my leg and see if it's moving and because I really felt like it was, and indeed it was moving, it was moving. So when ever happened in this age of joke, was was good for me because I was able to start moving a muscle. First time I was able to move a muscle any muscle."

We have a row boat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the motor in the back, and you were not allowed to go fast. It was like to whack like fi know five fast, so it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the, you know, off the boat. But they let me actually mow it that like that.

And there'd be nothing wrong. But I called a guy from work, I used my phone and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cellphone number. So, I want to leave him a voicemail message and I was surprised to hear him answer and that's when he told me, you called my cell number. So I worked for a very practical company to work for and I didn't want to tell them yet, what was going on, so I kind of jokingly told him.Something that would make him laugh but at least they would be notified. I wouldn't be in that day and I said pass the word on my friends not working right today, I won't be in. And so he just chuckled and said, okay, I'll pass it on and then I call the front and told him what was going on and off then between two of us. We decided Well my my idea I will call him and half hour if you don't hear from me call me. If you can't reach me, call for help. So how far better I call them? And I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did My Neighbor Next Door came and got me andWe went to the hospital. I don't know why, or how we want to the hospital that we did was a great one. We got for hospitals to choose from. I don't even know why remember why we went to that one, but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago."

So there were no therapy. You just, you are able to survive as to like, I'm able to just get discharged Hospital, go and as I just did not do therapy in those years. And and over the course next twenty years wage wife and I found out about from people that had at their feet.Brain injuries later that the divorce rate among the brain injured approaches 90% And the suicide rate of points to bring into this. Four to five times national average wage as what they're telling people even. Fifteen years ago and so I wanted to wanted to share that with with patients at our age, I'd just to give them that that recovery is as possible but it did take a long time and in L for when I started their garage, I thought it was I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families, a year to a year, and half recovered year to year in Africa, back to your recovery.Hey. You don't stop recovering the rate, maybe asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty radically after a year to year and half, but you never never stopped recovery.

And when I was talking and visiting with my friends, in that group, what I was saying, and what they heard me, I could hear me didn't make sense. As far as to the words that I was speaking.The words were correct. But they were. Not making sense as complete works. So I knew there, something wrong with my friends knew there was something wrong. So when I got through the exercise class, we spent an hour exercising together a home and had breakfast. No, I do Patty. I said there's something wrong. I need to take over the doctor that I want her to take me to my heart, doctor wage, and she decided that rather than that would take me to the emergency room and they're at the emergency room, they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke. And so I spent the nextThree days. There was a problem with my heart. My heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm, and so they spent most of the time from the next month or two or three days correcting that issue. And then after they corrected, that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia. And I discovered that I'd had a stroke and had Aphasia. So, that's pretty much where IThat sounds like it could have been really scary but you just handled it. Like it was Another day, I try to know. I really didn't. You know, I saw I had a headache and Talking with Patti later, she said on on the Wednesday, the day before I woke up with a headache, she said you had a headache flip that down to like Wednesday night late and mention that I had a headache then so I don't remember that at all. That part of it off.So do you still play The Joker's? Yes, I do. My grandpa got me into his sudokus. His name is actually also Jerry. So that's kind of a fun fact connection. Yeah. Yeah."

All I remember about the stroke is a fact that I woke up one morning with a splitting headache, and it was so bad.I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had a couple aspirin. I went to outside pick up the mail. The mail but my newspaper went back. That breakfast. And as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast. I tried to read I could not make it.Read the paper properly. The blocks of words were just sat. There were blocks. And some of them they weren't all together. It's like I've seen part of the words part of the block report, not the whole words. so, I left the newspaper that morning and didn't Read it and finished getting ready went to work and drove to work and all the way to work.I noticed that on the dashboard of the car again parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard and parts of it. I couldn't see, I couldn't see all the words, all that but I was able to drive properly. And drove to work, got to work.

I didn't know my password anything. And I just had a total blank with that choice. So I worked at it for a while and couldn't couldn't do anything. So, I finally went to my boss and said, hey, I've got a problem. I've got a headache and I just can't log.Can't log in and I was just take time. Find a place to rest and relax and come back a little while and try again. So I just a dark room for about half an hour. I went back in and try it again, that could make it. So I finally stood out, I can't do it. I need to go home. So I went home went to bed, I got home. I took a couple more aspirin, went to bed and spent most of the day in bed and I sleptand then when I got up in the afternoon, I was able to read able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I can read a little bit of that, but it still has problems and do Sudoku puzzle."

Just try to tell me direct what it is that you need. And once again, when I log,Was coming out, obviously wasn't coming out on the other side and that put my wife's red flag up. So my oldest son happened to me in that weekend, he was with us. So my wife called him and he said just go down to your daddy's doing popped him and see if he's making sense and he felt he felt the same way and I didn't feel any physical pain and physical. I wasn't, my I wasn't drawing he. I was my lips were fine. I was in Peril paralyzed. Anything didn't feel everything, physical felt great but my communication wasn't right, but I didn't really know what at that point in time. And So, within my son, call back within a few minutes, she came home and said, no, she's I think we have to go to the doctor. All right now the little bits. No, I'm okay. And you know, that type of thing.And she said, no, she's just not making sense list. Just let it get checked out and we went. So she had it was an Urgent Care. Few minutes away. I walked into the Urgent Care. Still feeling good. We grow them. I walked in. We signed in gave the insurance called, did all that went into the office where the physician was going to come in, the gal, came in. The nurse came in to stock to take my God. That's true. And then I passed out and after that, I don't remember a lot."

I think those a piece went off, maybe six to eight weeks as I recall and that was helpful. But I think the real value to me was to confirm change to work on myself and continue to improve myself. For example, when I was reading I had to read write down what I believe. I just bought a red and then practiced saying the words and I've been doing that now probably for about three and half years, I continue to deal with certain situations but I can see personally my growth from where I was dead.Actually, you know, to where I am right now.

And I says, two days ago but I had it in my head which I always rolled right. You know, that's how I would write though. It was always here dead.Now put it put in a down you know that I could just go from there would be you know and so I thought so that's kind of a cool thing. You know that off the one she thinks she did say is that you will never be an ER nurse because you're think you'll have it all perfect which is how it is awful. You know, it still is in my head, I can't do it quick because I'm going to make it. I might make a mistake and I wouldn't want to have a mistake.

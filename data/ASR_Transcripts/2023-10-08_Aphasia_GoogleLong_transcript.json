I mean, it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down. And go up and you had another time to keep getting better than you were.So it's been nice to keep going. If you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that, it helps some a lot better. Now, I'm going to show you. These pictures again, just take a little time to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with the beginning, a middle and an end, and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.And you can start whenever you are ready. okay, the boy was out outside with the, with the Soccer ball. He's kicking around. And he kicked one really good. But it hit right in the middle of the window on the on the house there. So, the next one over there, her looks like her dad. You might have been sleeping. and jumped out pretty good when the the soccer ball and went through the window into the house.And a lamp broke down there, too. and, But you really can't tell on number four. I can't see what the with my picture and you, and And they're all, I can't see what number four is on there. Really? if you click on my face, there should be a way to move the box to where you can see.4. Which one you saying? So if you click on this, small screen with my face on it, if you click it and drag, View options. No, just like actually on my face, there should be a little, your cursor should change. It on the top or the bottom. In the middle.Click and then you can drag it and move. The Box. Good idea here. I'm just gonna show you on. Hey, Mom. Yeah, you won where you want to move this so you know how to move this out of the way.Because I can't see the last one here. Or that maybe yeah. You'll click on the window with my face on it. And drag it across the screen right here, just click here and then drag it across this. Ah, I got you. Looks like he is not very happy because he got his own. Soccer ball.

Everybody's name everybody the computer on there. TheThe coax and everything the wrong about it. You have nothing about it yet. Remember everything about it. So I'm We went to. I had like 30 30 days first but they brought in there trying to get to see what I was in mostly to see what it was first time. and then, We went to. after that, that's when we started to talk into, Can.Sort of thing, make sure don't forget some ten years before. And we did start like on. ABC 123 or something like that with my mom. Started to it's in. and, Books. I went there. There was someone we got to talk over there. And she talked to me all the time about. Remember how you started about everything getting all ABC. One, two, three, throw again. AndAnd it took a long time is about a year. The start over that and I've gone down. It was Monday to Friday. Now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that, there's a bigger place and Chicago for six weeks. Just try to talk a little better on that because I mean at this time I could talk a little better but it just hard to get back, everything out of there. So that helped different things about it for those six weeks. How you're trying to computer or trying to try to ride on there, trying to do something about it.Get a little better there and that's how they try to. After that, they started IU. And that's when they Started with noun verb. Preposition of this kind of things again and there's so much. You couldn't remember anything about it. and, but it's you just take your time. Trying to me and my mom. My mom helps me all the time. Still trying to rewrite everything. So I can't let's get a rewrite things about it.after you do that, you do very good about those things with any forgot about the other things, you Did back. So, it doesn't keep everything in there long time. So it's got to keep everything. Keep. Where you're getting things? You're doing there and still won't be able to talk. Mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing. And they talk to me real quick. This is kind of weird because if one person talked to me kills me,if there's three people, I can understand other people, I understand what it is, but so it takes time, I'm getting around everything, so so it's just keeps going every year and still again just getting a little better and I don't know how long I can go but it's just it seems like I'm still doing something with it. So And it keeps going over time. So, So I try to ride every day, all kinds of stuff I can. And I'm just my mom's very helping that and my sisters have helped a little bit there too. They needed to do something like that. And I have my brothers."

And there feeling, um, I was also very sad, very emotional feeling, didn't I couldn't even remember who I was. And so I'm getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are. I was more panicked than that, kind of stuff.Once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad, and people that were saying there for how many years to days, I figure out how people were that. I remembered so said, let's go for our therapy. Now, let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, we started working on therapy and they said, you have aphasia. um, andBy talking, I couldn't say pretty much any. I couldn't say anything. They were saying like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me like a cup. You want something to drink. They take the cup and show me, and I go yes or no. It took me a even harder to understand that. This goes this way. If you want it, if you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out, little things like that that I didn't remember.Then. once I was able to at least, think a little bit more, we started with Pictures. Like that bird and and the boy and the banana. And we start that was our therapy. Starting was affected. Being able to say certain words. And my first name took about another year to be. I'll save my last name, my kids and everything else. So, so working on therapy myself. I have a book at home that I still do my homework every day.So still going. That's yeah. I I'm the only thing I can't do right now. Yet is read and write and I said but I told myself that I'm going to do it. So I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up. So you know, I'm going to read someday and I will write and I will have numbers at some point. So, yeah. Thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently. I'm, let's see. Um, let's, let's"

And we on the weekends, you went to the cottage and we wouldn't go every weekend. But most of the time we did especially with summertime was not schools. You know, we would take that time and I think that was what my favorite places to go. We couldFish. We could swim, we could and it wasn't very deep. There was a lot now as deep in the middle. But right now, you I mean you could really have to swim. You could just walk around a little bit. there were frogs, there was a turtles. So, I mean, it was, we got up in the morning and I think we ate as fast as we could, to be to go outside and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed. And I remember all of those memories on the fact, thatAll the fun things. So we were able to do. Like my dad, let me, we have a row boat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the motor in the back and it may, you were not allowed to go fast. It was like, too, like Five. No five. Fast. So it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the, you know, the boat. But they let me actually mow it that like that. And for me being old enough not to drive, I could use that that paddle boat and stuff like that. I loved toTo drive. I just thought that was really cool. I'm not sure why. Now it was like, it was such a big thing, but it was, you know, and I was by myself on the boat, you know. I thought it was something else, you know, and all that, we forgot the gas one time. We had to roll back stuff like that when I was a kid. but I think that was and at night we had a, we had like a place to lay down outside and we would Go to bed the whole night outside, if it was really pretty. And I, I think when I have my, if I have a bad night now, I actually dream in my head on that Lake cottage. I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads. Nights to go to bed.

She wanted to hold that baby in. She just remember, I took a picture with that baby, and I thought she just looks so natural with that baby.

And I'm not gonna be able to cook because they're messing with all this food and everything and he thought those little videos, maybe two minutes long each.He thought those were hilarious. And he would watch over and over again because that's what little kids do. When they like a video, you know, they just a hundred times, you know. And then and then his baby brother came along and Think of there. So two years difference. Yeah, two years. And so the baby. he's just a cute, he can be so he's right about almost two and somewhat's a difference between the two and their personalities andbut the first one, he's A super smart. He's also very manipulative you know and so he works that cuteness angle, you know, and Then the second one. He was a lot more agreeable. And he was plenty smart, but I could tell not to love. His brother is You know, it's like he didn't get stuff quite as quickly as like you he had to work with him a while and but but then you get it. He was fine. I think he just likes to analyze maybe more, you know I'm just to think things through.

Those Last Christmas I went to go see them Christmas and I FaceTime with them a lot. And so the older one, he'sThrilled to see me and he just runs to me and you know, it's pretty, you know, what's me? Pick him up and everything but the baby, even though you'd see my face a lot on the screen and of course, I've seen him in person too, but not real often. It took him a minute, he had to watch his older brother, like, I guess it's okay to post sitting here. It was like it seem like at some point. A light. Switched on with him and he was like, she's fine. So I've never had both all my life and they just for about an hour two, I was enjoying Celebrity Status. It was just a cool. So I yeah, I always heard half much fun, grandbabies are but Oh my gosh, instant celebrity is so much fun. So that's the probably the best things ever happened to me."

Went to the gym and felt good came home. Took a shower everything that I do. Normally my wife was at work at that point in time. And I had remembered something that I needed to do. So I called her on the phone, and I spoke to her and she said to me, you're not making sense. Let me just tell me what you need and I told what I need. And she says, you're not making sense to me, but to meI felt like I was making sense so I thought there was a disconnect. So I was joking around said well you know I don't make sense you all the time. This is just one of those times, I'm not making sense, you know, she said you, you're all over the place, just try to tell me direct what it is that you need. And once again, what I thought was coming out, obviously wasn't coming out on the other side and that put my wife's red flag up. So, My oldest son happened to be in that weekend, he was with us. So my wife called him and he said just go down to your daddy's doing and talked him and see if he's making sense. And he felt he felt the same way and I didn't feel any physical.Pain and physical. I wasn't my I wasn't drawn here. I wasn't my lips were fine. I wasn't parallel paralyzed anything. It didn't feel everything. Physically felt great, But my communication wasn't right but I didn't really know it at that point in time. And So within my son called the back within a few minutes, my wife came home, you know she's I think we have to go to the doctor but I battled a little bit. No I'm okay. I'm you know that type of thing.And she said, no, she's just not making senseless. Just let it get checked out and we went. So she had it. There was an urgent care of few minutes away. I walked into the Urgent Care. Still feeling good. We grow there. I walked in we signed in gave the insurance card to all that went into the office where the physician was going to come in, the gal, came in, the nurse came in to start to take my pressure. and then, I Passed out and after that, I don't remember a lot."

I think those therapies went off, maybe six to eight weeks, as I recall And that was helpful. But I think the real value to me was to continue to work on myself and continue to improve myself. For example, when I was reading I had to read right now what I believe I just read and then practice saying the words and I've been doing that now probably for about three and a half years, I continue to do with certain situations but I can see personally my growth from where I was initially, you know, to where I am right now.

This is how it's, you know, this is how it goes. So, you know, that's why proofreading and all that I would all the way through college.

You're the only one that's getting a hundred and I thought, okay, that's a good thing, you know? Because she says you covered everything, you know, and it's like well and and she says, when did you write it? And I says, two days ago, But I had it in my head which I always wrote right, you know, that's how I would write though. It was alwaysHere. but now put it putting it down you know that I could just go and there would be you know and so I thought so that's kind of a cool thing, you know that and but the one she thinks she did say is that you will never be an ER nurse because you think you'll have it all perfect, which is how it is, you know, it still is in my head, I can't do it quick because I'm gonna make it. I might make a mistake and I wouldn't want to have a mistake. So therefore, I would never put myself in that position. She was absolutely right.

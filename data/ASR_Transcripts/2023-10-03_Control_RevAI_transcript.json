The mother's holding the umbrella and the mother is trying to get the child to take the umbrella, and the child is saying, the boy, it is saying, no, nope, I'm not gonna take it. Which upsets the mother, but she does, doesn't get her way. So the boy takes off and it starts dripping. Then it gets harder and it starts raining more. And it starts raining more. But he goes back home. He is soaking wet. She is upset with him and he's got a down looked face and then ends with him walking back, I guess, towards school with the umbrella.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:50    Okay, this looks like a fireman where a arrest man in the rescue system, uh, he could be in the ambulance system, has a life jacket on, has jumped into a swirling, uh, sort of a creek, trying to pull out a little girl and, uh, who is hanging onto this limb and getting and saving the little girl from the, from the raging waters of this swelled creek. Due to the reins that have come. This is a story of a little girl, little orphan girl comes from a very poor family. Her name is Cinderella, and she is sent off to another home, uh, with a woman and two daughters who are not very welcoming at all. In fact, the daughters are quite jealous and the woman is quite, almost mean. She, she tries, uh, they make a, a servant out of Cinderella. She waits on the, the daughter's and the mother hand and foot cleaning, picking up after 'em, trying to take care of the cat, which has little thorn horns on it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and the cat doesn't like it at all. Well, Cinderella, there's the big ball, annual ball coming up at the castle, and the king has raised holy cane with his son about finding the wife, and he decides to throw this paw to get him introduced to the young ladies or the young ladies in the community.

She's poor. The mother and the daughter's jealous of her. They don't want her to do anything. All they're interested is in their own wellbeing and how they're going to look and how they're gonna dress and what they're gonna put on and this and that. And they squabble and bicker and fight among themselves. And in the meantime, Cinderella looks at to one of the gowns that the girls are going join thing.

And by golly, they go to the ferry godmother and, and, and they take Cinderella there. \n"}, {"job_id": "deBOoPgA6A8sQ2hS", "filename": "NEURAL18-2_270042_510009.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And who did you eat lunch with or where did you walk after school with so and so? Or you know, what you talk about? Um, and usually I just get shut down and I think that probably I keep doing it. I keep asking the questions because I feel like the very little bit of communication she gives me or feedback, I'll take it. Um, but that's not to say I don't use strategy. Sometimes what I do is probably, um, not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive aggressive with her. And it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't wanna know anything, and I'm like, fine, or, you know, I just walk away usually a little bit later she will know that she somehow impacted. I, I think she knows she has hurt me in some way that she knows she's now withholding the information and that my walking away is, is because she knows I want more and because I care. It's like we have to go through a dance. It's like this dance to get a little bit more information. Um, but I do it because anything I can get, I'll take  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:23    Thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. Um, it can be happy or sad. It could be from any time chil childhood to now. Just anything that sticks out to you as being an important event. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And whenever you're ready, you may begin.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:42    Okay. This wasn't a single time. It was, I would say, um, every Sunday, just about every Sunday. There were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday and it was the highlight of my week. My grandparents, uh, my mom's parents, um, were just everything that I wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple, and his willingness to be chivalrous. But my grandma had her own mind. It's like he at that time was able to, to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play. But he did it. And so it was really important for me, um, because I just lived with, or I just had my mom at home, um, to see this really healthy dynamic between two people and everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there, my grandpa would have, uh, he always had a handful of nuts, um, because there was a squirrel named PD who lived in the tree in front of his house.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:07    Now I'm sure it wasn't just one pd, there were probably 20 PDs, but I thought it was PD and I just always called pd. And so we would feed Pete and then we would go inside and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of, um, dinner, uh, late afternoon-ish dinner. And it was always fancy, like high noon kind of dinner. And, you know, it was, everything was always homemade and wonderful. And she laid out the table so beautifully and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that. We would have our nice lunch and we would all clean up, and then my grandpa would pull carrots out of the refrigerator and we would walk to this little horse stable area right near their house. \n"}, {"job_id": "lX8ak5LDeXrmsD1x", "filename": "capilouto56a_967489_1207427.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Once upon a time there was a family and there was a mother and a father and a daughter.

But she had two daughters and Cinderella who had been the joy of her mother and father was suddenly relegated to the uras. And she had to do all the chores for her two stepsisters. And her stepmother didn't think much of her either, so she just had a terrible time. And then there was, in this kingdom where Cinderella lived, there was a, uh, a king, and he decided that it was time for his son to get married. So he sent out, um, an edict that all the, uh, eligible young attracted women in the, in the kingdom would come for a ball and they would have a ball on a certain night.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    And so the invitations went out to all and sundry. And it came to the house where Cinderella lived, where their two stepsisters, and they were all eligible. Their two stepsisters were not very pretty. So, but they got really excited and they got, oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes and marvelous this, marvelous that. And Cinderella got excited too, and she thought it would be just great, but she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball and she would have to help her sisters get ready. And so the night came and they got themselves ready and they went off in a carriage and they were, you know, looking, looking down their nose at her. And she was ready to cry. And all of a sudden a fairy godmother showed up and touched her with a wound.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:01    And she turned into the, this beautiful dress. And then there was a pumpkin, and she turned that into a coach. And then there was some mice, and she turned that into the horses. And she made this beautiful thing for this, for this Cinderella who wasn't going to get to go to the ball. And she had all these lovely little glass slippers. But she said, the one thing, you cannot stay out after midnight. So when the clock starts to strike, you've got to leave. You've got to go before the clock starts to strike. So she went to the ball, and when she got there, the prince saw her and he looked, took one look and he just fell in love. And so he found her and everybody else just had to stand back and wait because that's all he could do was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found. And they danced and they danced all over the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Place and everybody else was sort of put to the side. And, but you know what? She forgot that she had to leave at midnight, so the clock started to strike and she remembered. So she started flying down the steps to leave, but she lost a slipper and she flew out the door and by this time her carriage had turned into a pumpkin and her horseman had turned into mice, but she finally got home. I've forgotten exactly how, but she got home and there she was by the, again, by in the cinders, by the fireplace. And the other two daughters came home. And of course they had the story to tell, but a along came an envoy from the kingdom. And he said, we're trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper.

She was the, uh, daughter of two loving parents. Only one day when she's a little girl, her mother dies suddenly. It's very tragic. Everybody cries, everybody like her mother, uh, her father and his grief. And in his worry about Cinderella, having a mom goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women, unfortunately, are spiteful jealous creatures. Um, he brings them all home to his lovely manner where they, uh, immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father partly out of heartbreak and partly out just a really bad diet also dies. Uh, at this point, the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella, basically into a ski, and they make her run around working all the time, and they begin mocking her for being dirty.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    And they call her Cinderella. Now, their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all of the other brides and the adjoin, uh, all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands, decides he will marry one of his own people, or perhaps he's commanded to hold the ball. Um, and he will invite all of the, uh, eligible women of his kingdom to the ball, um, to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this. They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns. Um, Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go to just to, you know, get outta the house, have a bit of glamor.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:38    Uh, but of course they won't let her because they, they tell her that she would be an embarrassment, but mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball. And, uh, Cinderella is left alone, sort of brokenhearted and downcast, and basically an empty house. And she begins crying and she's just crying and crying by the fireplace when all of a sudden, uh, a woman materializes from the flames and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says, I just, I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, oh, well, I am your fairy godmother and is within my power to grant this. So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and, uh, some frogs and, um, uh, you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers. And so that will do. And she waves her wand and the pumpkin turns into a carriage, and her ball, her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ballgown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass, and, you know, none nearly as beautiful or, or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into, uh, horses. And, and Cinderella is just overcome with joy. And, and she gets into the carriage, and she's about to ride off to the Paul. When the fairy godmother says, unfortunately, my magic power  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Is limited. And at midnight when the the chimes go, uh, everything will turn back. So make sure that you are well away from the ball and, and out of, uh, you know, an embarrassing, compromising situation before that happens. So CI says, I will, I will. And she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball and she arrives, and it's even more dazzling than she thought. And she comes in and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming. And, uh, in the midst of, of her being greeted by, by throngs of enchanted admirers, the prince looks up and he sees her and he asks her to dance, and they begin to dance. And of course, they're both super hot, so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason, um, except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together. Uh, and the prince is, is about to propose to her there and then on the spot, and the clock begins to strike 12. And she says, oh, no. Oh yeah, I need to go.

And so she cleans the place with all the help of the woodland creatures who like the way she sings, like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know. I think hum shows up. Um, so she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling. And then she yawns and falls all across the beds. There are seven of them, and she just falls all across them. And it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there. And about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work. Hi ho. Hi ho. They work in the mines. There is dog, happy, grumpy, dopey, bashful, sneezy. I can do this.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    Happy dog. Grumpy, dopey, sneezy. Sleepy, sleepy Sleepy's the seventh. Okay? So there are those seven dwarves and they work in the mines gathering precious gyms and whatnot. And they come a marching home because of course it's their home. There are seven little beds for seven little dwarves. And they enter their home and they see this strange woman passed out across their beds, probably went to one too many parties. They don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men. It doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that. Um, and so she explains her situation. And because she's so dull faced and innocent looking, the dbs are all like, yeah, okay. I believe you. You can stay with us as long as you're in danger, as long as you keep cleaning up to place and like make her food and stuff.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:56    And since she's been working as a servant, she's cooled that. And so she lives with them happily for some time. And then the evil queen has been sitting smug in her castle thinking that she's killed snow White. And then one day she saunters up to the magic mirror and she says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of the mall. And the mirror says, still, still snow white still you didn't kill her. And the evil queen flies into a rage and she decides if you're gonna do something right, do it yourself. She probably kills the Huntsman, which probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. Um, so she goes down to her lair where she makes all her potions because as an evil queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white apple into and pulls it out and it is red as blood.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:57    And it is of course a poison apple because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples, hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking. I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified. Um, but then she disguises herself as this old crone and she marches off into the forest. I'm not, I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the doors are off to work and Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her animal friends probably. And Snow White answers the door and says, oh look, an old crone with a magically delicious looking apple, I'm probably completely safe. And the old crone says, would you like an apple child? And she says, yep, still safe. And she takes the apple and the cone says, yes, child.

So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella and he didn't want to take it 'cause he didn't believe it rained. So right as he started walking outside, it started raining and he gets mad and is stomping through the puddles, wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house, wet and gets the umbrella, then continues on his journey.  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:47    Okay,  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:48    Great. So here's another picture.

So he brought a ladder, placed it on the branch, climbed up, and then his ladder fell. So he stuck up in the tree with the cat and for some reason, the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out. So they had to call the fire department and the fire department came and the fire department's on their way to rescue them, to rescue the cat and the father.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:30    And  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:31    That's it. Okay,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:32    Great. Thank you. Okay, so now, um, I'm gonna have you, this is again another Oh God story <laugh>. Okay. This is, have you ever heard of Snow White?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    I've heard of it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:44    Okay, that's, that's fine. Um, take your time to look at the pictures. Okay. And tell a story. I want you, oh wait, sorry. Um, you know, the pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm gonna take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures. Okay. And then ask you to tell me the story in your own words.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:58    Okay. I think,  \nSpeaker 2    00:03:01    What  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:01    Was it? Like the magic mirror. Alright. So, okay.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:12    So, um, now just tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can and you can use any details that you know prior or what you  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:19    Just looked at. Okay. So just what I looked at <laugh>  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:21    <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:22    So there was this queen who was hoping she'd be the most, the fairest lady of the land. All right. And so she'd asked that her magic mirror, which had a face in it. And she'd ask, who's the Ferris lady of the mall? And usually the mirror would reply, she is, but one day the mirror replied, snow white is so the queen was upset and bandage snow white. And then Snow White was going through the forest and she found seven dwarfs.

Anyway, so there was this girl and she had a family and her father was a little well off. And then her mother ended up dying. And so her father, her father remarried a woman, the evil stepmother who had two daughters, Anastasia and maybe, I don't know, I remember they had like longer kind of mouthful names. And so they ended up moving in and like the two sisters like bickered a lot. And the, the stepmom didn't like Cinderella.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    And then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil stepsisters and uh, <laugh>, this is so weird to tell it <laugh>. Um, and so then the evil stepmother was like, you're just gonna be a maid in the house. 'cause she didn't really like her. So she like exiled her to like a room in the attic. And that made her pretty much a servant. And one day the Prince, prince charming and now that he was having a ball, I think in order to look for a wife or something like that. And the stepsisters or the stepmother really wanted the stepsister to go and the stepsisters wanted to go too 'cause they wanted to go meet the prince and have their shot at him to see if they could marry him. And Cinderella was like, oh cool, maybe I'll go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    And the stepmother was like, yeah, nope, <laugh>. Um, and so I think Cinderella has her animal accomplices. I know one's, the mike's name is Gus. Gus, I don't dunno, the other one. And her animal and the birds and stuff, the singing birds. And they make like a dress for her. She's like looking through, I think it was her mom's stuff. So she gets an old dress of her mom's and then they make it all pretty and stuff for her. And so she's getting ready to go to the ball and she walks downstairs to go out and the sisters and the stepmother like rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry. Um, because they don't want her going. And I think maybe  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    They locked her a room or something. I don't know how she ends up getting out. But anyway, she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the ball or getting ready to go. And then fairy godmother appears okay, she doesn't try to sneak out. The fairy godmother appears first, and then it is like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess. And then she turns her gown into like this beautiful ball gown. She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods <laugh>. And the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into a carriage and like her animal friends turn into horses. And so then she goes to the ball. She makes this late grand entrance and the prince is like very fascinated with her. And so they have a dance. But one of the conditions of this magic from the fairy godmother was that it expires at midnight. So she's dancing with him and the clock strikes like symbolized that the time or like midnight is coming into. \n"}, {"job_id": "A7bjeX7eiyP0VO0I", "filename": "capilouto44a_1521526_1761360.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Cinderella lived in a house with her two sisters and her evil grandmother and poor Cinderella because she was the baby of the family, always got stuck with doing all the chores. And that didn't matter if she was out tending the animals out in the barn or feeding the dog or sloping the hogs, and even having to cook all the meals. And her two older sisters, they just had to run of the house. They just got to go to all the parties and, uh, play around the way they wanted to do. And no matter what Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, the grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:48    Well, every year they have this large dance in town, and it's to celebrate, I guess, the, the harvest and all of that type of stuff. So they have this big party and everybody gets dressed up and there's all kind of, um, food and dancing and so forth. And Cinderella's never been able to go. I mean, she's just always shun because she's just the dog, sort of, as far as the evil grandmother knows. So the two sisters come along and they get all dressed up and they're off to the party. Well, they're having such a wonderful time and course Cinderella, Cinderella's at home. And, uh, she sort of aside herself, but all of a sudden a fairy godmother appears to her and says, Cinderella, why are you sitting at home? And says, well, I don't have a dress and I have no preparation to, you know, my grandmother hates me.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    My sisters hate me, and I'm never allowed to go anywhere. So the Fury godmother says, well, we're gonna fix that today, and I'm going to get you a new gown, and in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So he, she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown and, uh, gets all these fancy shoes. And I think her, her feet were made out of like glass slippers. They were probably like a, a rock crystal. So she gets transported to the dance. And man, her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, you know, with the king and the queen and the prince being there, the prince, uh, just is really impressed with this Cinderella joke. And, uh, so they dance  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    And they dance and they dance and they dance. And the day seems to go by so quickly, but all of a sudden, uh, Cinderella hears the clock ringing and the bells start chiming. And she remembers that her fairy godmother said that, boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight or else you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person. And all of this stuff is going to be washed away, and everybody will know that it's just like a ploy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from, and in the process loses one of her shoes. But she does manage to get home. And her feary godmother collects up all of her garb and everything. \n"}, {"job_id": "n89e8f9pyJWtFfIp", "filename": "richardson21_881144_1120959.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And the mice, the brave little mice who have been turned into horses and chased by cats and made her a dress that got ripped to shreds, still somehow find it within their little mousey hearts to go down and steal the key to the room. Cinderella's locked in from the evil stepmother and they bring it up to her after much trial and error and Cinderella unlocks the door. She goes downstairs, just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsister's feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass swept up and everyone panics because the stepsisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the prince was dancing with. Obviously. That's the only reason they can't prove that. And the advisor's panicking because King wants the prince to get married. The prince will only marry the person who fits this shoe, and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says, but wait, I have the other sliver.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    And lo and behold, she does in fact have the other slipper, which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why. Very godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes and she shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper. And then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot. I don't think she should be able to stand in real life and puts it on her. And it fits beautifully, of course. And so there was triumphant music and they all lived happily ever after. The princess. No Cinderella. She wasn't a princess yet. Had to get the ring first. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind and married the prince. Probably still doesn't know her name. The end the end. Alright, that's awesome. Is that too long? No, that was great. Okay. Okay. So now I'm gonna have you do the same type thing. Oh, excellent. But there's no white. Okay. Okay. So again, we've covered up all of the type, so just look through the pictures. Less comprehensive knowledge of snow whites. This will probably be shorter.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:20    That's fine. I wish  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:42    She's very melodramatic. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, look at this. Look at this. What is this face? <laugh>. I mean, I get that she's panicked, but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances.  \nSpeaker 2    00:03:15    All right, so, so snow way from the seven doors. Yes, it's Yes. Was told for somebody who vaguely remembers that, that's fine. Okay. So, hmm. Now, I'm not sure if Snow White was actually a princess or something before the evil Queen usurped her throne. Or if like she's the beautiful cousin or something and we're just waiting for the evil queen to die off before she snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there's this evil queen. She's got the high regal cheekbone. She could probably be nice looking if she wasn't so evil. So I don't know what she's so insecure about. But Snow White is the fairest in all the land. \n"}, {"job_id": "0kjUhWucA7GrP4qw", "filename": "wright73a_1223620_1463420.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, once upon a time, there was this woman that had two of her daughters and a third one that was like a maid. She did all the work for them. But the other two were spoiled brats because they didn't have anything to do with her and they thought they was something special. And, uh, whenever she would come in with, uh, some tea or coffee or no tea, 'cause it was in a pot, uh, some tea, they would bring it. She would bring it to them and they would make fun of her 'cause she was not dressed like they were. And, uh, then they didn't even want it because they didn't feel like having it then. So they complained. And she liked, according to the pictures that I sort of remember, she liked little animals. She liked the mice, she liked the horse, she liked the dog, the cat.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And she found peace with them. She got along with them. And, uh, finally there was one time that someone brought her a dress, a a man, uh, was relative, I guess. And she tried on, she looked very pretty, and the sisters were jealous. They didn't want her to have that dress. She did. She looked lovely, but they didn't wanna admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, Hmm, I have to watch you. So that was that. But then they took the dress away and then by and by they hear that they're gonna have a big ball at this palace.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    And they got some kind of written notice on it. And so the mother says to the two, the three of them heard it together. The little girl that was mistreated and the two stepsisters, they all heard, they're all very happy. And so, uh, she, uh, says, okay, we're gonna get you dressed up in the most beautiful dresses and make sure that you get the prize, because I understand that he's looking for a woman. So they, the, she the, uh, the mother gets the two stepdaughters dressed up as best she could. In the meantime, Cinderella went up to the attic and she looks through some of the things that were there, and she finds a little book with a picture and a dress, a beautiful dress. Uh, and she says, that's nice. Now the four mice are there. And they say they could hear her. She says that, that, that would be nice. I would like to have that dress. And they make it for her. They make it for her. So she puts it on. She looks beautiful.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    She has beads. She has a sash. And she has, uh, well, that, that what's, what, what they showed. And uh, then when the time came that they were to go, she came down because they were dressed up. So she was dressed up now in this dress, and they looked at her and she did look beautiful in it, but they tore the beads off, tore the sash off, took off her dress, says, you are not going to that party. Only we, because we look better and we'll win. And the mother is going right along with everything. So she says, you go to your room and take care of what you have to and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time. So she goes back in her room and she's very sad. And, uh, her fairy godmother comes along and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? She says, because I wanted to go to the party. \n"}, {"job_id": "4fN1p9USCzbHvSA0", "filename": "NEURAL43-1_1372980_1612774.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, so Cinderella was an only child, and she, I, I guess her father, uh, got remarried to a woman who became her stepmother. And this woman had two daughters of her own. And they quickly moved into Cinderella's house and overtook the house. And I do forget what happened to the dad, but he went off and it was just Cinderella, the two stepsisters. And the stepmother. And the stepmother and the stepsisters used Cinderella as a maid and they renamed her to Cinderella 'cause of cis and all the cleaning. And she was dirty. And they told her how she wasn't pretty. And she was really, truly much prettier than her mean evil stepsisters. And, um, the, what would you call it? The town, the region decides the prince is gonna have a ball. And the two sisters come home and her, their mom. And they're very excited because there's going to be a ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    And all the young women of the lands are invited. And the, um, two sisters start planning their outfits and the mother's involved in it and all assuming that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty and ugh, the prince would never wanna see her. So midnight comes and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful, uh, and off they go to the ball. And I think the mother may have gone as well. And she's left at home and she's sitting out in the garden and her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother has a chitchat with her and finds out she really does wanna go. So the fairy godmother, um, uses her wonderful magic wand and then uses the help of the tiny little mice and the mice or poof, become the, um, I don't know what you call it, the, uh, chariot attendants.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:59    So the ma the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful in a dress. Her hair's all done up. She's absolutely exquisite. She takes a pumpkin, blah boom. The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot. The mice become the chariot people. They open the doors, they drive her off to the ball. She has a lovely night. Oh, almost forgot as she gets into the pumpkin chariot, which is now beautiful. The fairy godmother says, have a great time, but you must be home by midnight. 'cause all this is gonna disappear. The magic at midnight. So she goes off, she goes to the ball and the prince is dancing with everybody. And of course, he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room. He asks her to dance. They have many lovely dances. And then all of a sudden she tunes into what time it is somehow. And she says, I must leave. He says, no, no, no. And she's like, no, I really must go. She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight. She's running down the steps of the palace. She just gets into  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Her, um, pumpkin chariot. She leaves as she's running, she leaves a sandal step, uh, what you call it, a beautiful pump on the steps. She, as she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin. She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters, and they come home and say, what a wonderful time. They kind of tease her for being stuck at home, um, and ask her what she did. And they dream about what a wonderful time. And then everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind. And he is going throughout the lands to find who's foot fits this slipper. And it's a very delicate glass slipper. And so eventually they get to Cinderella's home. The two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it. Of course, it doesn't fit. Cinderella wants to try it. They think it's ridiculous because she wasn't really supposed to be there. \n"}, {"job_id": "a7wkYvclhbJMrCYD", "filename": "wright81a_1340_241130.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    You take two pieces of bread or two slices of bread, you get a jar of peanut butter and you spread one side of each slice of bread with the peanut butter.

Uh, in April, 2016, I went to see Mumford and Sons, and I stayed in Indianapolis at the Alexander Hotel with a friend. And when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, uh, I remember feeling a lump under my left armpit, my left side. Uh, and it was in a really funny location, so I was sort of surprised, uh, that I found it. So I made an appointment to get, uh, mammogram and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound, and I took my friend Dorothy with me. Um, and the oncologist who was there, uh, said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with stage two cancer. So I called my sister, who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff. Um, but she lives in Chicago, so she wasn't gonna let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:16    So I went to Chicago to Northwestern for, uh, what seemed like that entire summer, may, June, July. It takes many months to, um, compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer. And especially the first time they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they choose the best course of treatment. Um, especially because I was 40, they view that as young, and so it was pretty radical. Um, so anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months and months of agony, and then ultimately have, uh, I have a bilateral lumpectomy. So they found it in both sides, actually, after all the tests. And that was removed. My surgeon at Northwestern was great. Um, very comforting and confident, which is what I needed. And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern, so my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:22    The medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation, and then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. Um, so after I had my surgery, a week later, they put my port in, and the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. Um, so I went straight from the hospital over to, uh, the, where they administer the, the drugs for chemo. And, um, I had treatment every other week for a couple of months. And I recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful. And you can taste them, you can smell them. Um, but in your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells, they're, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that said that's, I guess how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing, being killed. Uh, after my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation and that just made me tired. So that was okay. And then that was right. I, I finished chemo on my birthday November 6th. My radiation ended just after Christmas. So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments.

Uh, when prom pilots were first used in speech therapy in the late nineties, early 2000, Medicare would not pay for them unless they had none of the additions that made Palm Pilot so wonderful and useful. It couldn't have a calendar and it couldn't have gains and it couldn't have a calculator.

This delivery room is on the campus of I U P U I and it is now a health center for students. Um, and I don't mean, I'm not really sure exactly, I don't think there are rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing, but I think it's clinics type thing. But this is an old post-war building and I believe it's two or three stories high. And it was a women's hospital at the time. I had my first two children. And the most amazing thing about this room is that there were windows and a door with, um, it was on the second floor and there was a, it's still there. You go to the Riley garage, you can see it. There's a stairway down, a wooden stairway, Noah, down to the ground level. And I remember the day that this wonderful thing happened.

All of a sudden, uh, she started hearing, uh, bells, and there's twinkling all around, and a fairy godmother appeared. And Cinderella says, who are you? I'm your fairy godmother, and I'm here to, to grant you a wish to go to the ball. And, uh, Cinderella says, well, I can't go because I don't have a dress, and I don't have a way to get there. So fairy mother waved, uh, or the, uh, fairy godmother waved her magic wand and, and created a dress for her. She says, oh, oh, the dress is beautiful, but I don't have any shoes. She ma waved her magic wand again, and had, and there were some glass slippers for her. Uh, so she put on the glass slippers, and now she was truly a beautiful, a beautiful, beautiful young lady. \n"}, {"job_id": "GewvMWT8ArKaA74Y", "filename": "NEURAL17-2_28625_268351.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, I gotta do a different one. <laugh>.

It was a, anyway, we slid off the roof and he landed on my ankle and it, my ankle was like, turned completely like this, and it was supposed to be like that, so it was crushed. He landed on it. Anyway, so, um, it was, I remember looking at my ankle and I just went like that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:53    So we went to the emergency room and, um, my doc, the doctor, they called in an orthopedic person and he, he said he'd, I'd never walk again. And that my ankle was crushed into many, many pieces. And he told me that, um, they weren't, they couldn't, um, there was no need for, uh, you know, plates and steel stuff to open it up. He was just going to anesthetize me and, um, put it back together like clay. 'cause they were all little pieces. So he, so anyway, they gave me IV morphine and, uh, he put my squished my ankle back together. I was in a cast for three months up to my hip. And, um, it was v it was a hard time, um, because I couldn't move for three months. And I, we lived in a cabin in Fairbanks without running water and without a bathroom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    We had an outhouse. So that <laugh>, if you're not the adventurous type, that will sound really disgusting. But, uh, like I said, I was young and I went to Alaska and thought it would be really fun to live in a cabin. We had electricity, no internet then, I don't think. There wasn't anything such thing as internet anyway. Um, so my husband took really good care of me. Uh, but I remember certain things. One was the morphine, uh, I felt after, after, for like a good day. I felt incredible love and peace. And I knew it was the morphine. I'd never felt that much love or peace in my life.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Um, it was really weird. Uh, but what helped me, um, I think I was just determined that I would walk again. I mean, I just, I couldn't believe that. I just, I never believed the doctor, you know, I just thought that was a bunch of, uh, ooey really, because I thought in this day and age, this is just a stupid bone, you know? And I, I just never believed them and real, you know, I think they saved, uh, you know, they protect themselves so legally. So I just, and I, I believe that firmly and I slowly got better. I, um, I was stubborn then, and I, I didn't do anything The doctor told me, and I'm, I, I regret that. I didn't go to physical therapy.

They all get inside the big red truck and they start up a very, very steep hill. They go across country and all of a sudden they hit very deep, rough, rocky road and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out, still clutching his, her it's peak ball. And all of a sudden it looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into, in, into the horizon where it's watching it disappear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    The ma family arrives at a lovely big gland with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic. So they are a pile out of the big truck carrying the picnic basket, the tables, the various ary items that they need for the picnic. They spread the table down. They're beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock. They're dancing, they're playing. They have musical instruments. The either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane. They have a big basket of food. They have a thermos jug with, um, a beverage of miss vi's t. The little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse, and they're all having an absolutely wonderful time. The next scene, they're playing the instrument. The mother and the father are sitting on the edge of the picnic cloth on the ground. All the beautiful picnic is all laid out. The mother and the grandparents are up on the side of a small hill playing music. The kids are playing baseball. Somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook.

Somebody is sailing a boat. The baseball glove is now laying on the ground. Mother is pouring milk. One of the babies is in the salad. Another one is eating watermelon.

I don't, I don't know. Like apparently she got like, really pretty all in one day. So, um, the mirror says that Snow White is the prettiest. And so the Queen Wizard ss, I don't know what she is. Anyway, she wants to get rid of Snow White. So, um, she, I don't puts like a bounty on her head or something like that. I, I don't, I don't know where she lived in the first place. Like, I don't know if she lives there or if she just lives in the town or what, but, um, she's mad at her and she wants her to go away.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    So Snow White knows that she has to run away, I guess, or hide or something. But anyway, there's this guy who's kind of like lumberjack sort of, and he shows up to the Queen because he needs money. And he said, yeah, I'll go kill her. And so he goes and he finds her, but then when he gets there, she's like really super nice and he feels bad. And so he doesn't kill her, but he's like, Hey, this lady, she's really trying to take you out, so you gotta get out of here. So she like runs in the forest and stuff. Oh yeah, before all this, she wants to marry the prince, but I don't know how she met the prince. So I don't know whether she saw a picture of him or whatever, but she likes his prince. And um, maybe the old lady is like a cougar, and she likes the prince too.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    Maybe the prince is her son and she doesn't think that snow white's good enough. I have no idea. But there is a prince and she likes this prince, or she dreams about it or whatever. So anyway, back to the lumberjack, he tells her to get outta here and she runs off in the woods and the woods are really, really scary and stuff. And she runs for a long time. And then it's sort of like three bears where she comes into this house and she's like, oh, I'm really tired. And she probably tries all these beds. But anyway, we only see her in one of the beds in the picture. And she is sleeping well while she's sleeping. The people that own the house come in and they are seven weird little dwarfy men. And apparently she does not think this is creepy. She thinks this is okay, and she becomes friends with them and they are pumped to have her staying with them, which obviously they would. She's the fairest in the land. So I don't know what she does there. Maybe she cleans. I know that they also whistle while they work and I think that they, um, work in a coal mine or something like that. And actually, um, this, I hope this doesn't, this is an aside here to this story.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    When I was little, I had this record that my parents put on for me all the time. And they used to laugh because I'd stand in my crib and I would sing the dig, dig song, but it was just me going, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. <laugh> against the crib thing. And so I told, I made the mistake of telling Adam. And so every once in a while when I'm working, like, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. I'm like, oh God. So anyway, I know that they dig from the record <laugh>, but I don't really know what they dig <laugh>. But they whistle when they go and they whistle when they come back. So something happens. Oh, that really mean, which lady makes herself like even more ugly, mean witch. And she comes up to Snow White. And I guess she's like, I don't know, like roaming farmer's market lady or something like that. She's like, I have apples and snow white's like, yay, because she's gonna make like apple pie or something for the little dwarf men.

In the morning, uh, little boy's getting ready for school, mother says, take your umbrella. It's supposed to rain today. I don't want the umbrella. The umbrella is not for cool kids. And as he walks to school, he gets stuck in the rain and it's coming down harder and harder, and he has to go back home.

And the dad remarried and had a stepmother who had two children, Anastasia and Drella. And the dad passed away. And when he died, the stepmother turned Cinderella into kind of a house made and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life while Cinderella scrubbed the floors, cleaned the fireplace. Um, but Cinderella knew that Sunday she would break away from this type of life. And she became friends with all the animals in the house except Lucifer. He was a mean old cat. It was a stepmother's cat, but she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends. And she lived upstairs in the attic and always dreamed of the castle she could see from her window. And the prince name was Prince Philip. Prince Philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife. So he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so that the prince could meet all the, uh, girls in the village. And the invitations get sent out and the stepmother opens the invitation and says, oh, it's gonna be a grand ball. And all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince.

She says, wash the floor, and says, well, I washed the floor yesterday. She says, well do it again. And she had to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball. And as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons. And when they're done, she goes upstairs the attic and finds a dress, a suit, an old trunk that used to be her mother's.

All right, so last time, I'm gonna tell you see, last time we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult. So I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother. I have an older brother, and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then. And the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get the, to the top of a wheel, uh, wheelchair. I've got wheelchair in my brain to get through the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him, and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed. But I was pretty scraped up from, and I decided I didn't like following suit with the shimmying of a tree.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:52    So they shimmied down. I was not gonna shimmy down. So my brother <laugh>, little tard, he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me, um, hobble home and try to, my mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff, but no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast, so you had to stay propped for a little bit, but minus that, it was a walking cast. I was fine. That's what I remember of that.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:41    So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating, but what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues, or did,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    I'm gonna have to tell the same story. So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church where I was their Sunday school teacher for 10 years and still go to Eagle with them for special needs retreat. Um, it's a group of about five to 600 special needs, most of which many do not communicate. Um, there's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities, which includes like the big square dance. So you just help them, whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they, um, have a hard time walking. Uh, but most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nods your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate, um, and hear over top of it. Uh, the three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers of which only one communicates.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:03    I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two don't. It's a series of grunts, some sign language. Over the years, I've of course learned the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. Um, we have her wedding ring upstairs. Um, he brings money in his pocket, that's his dowry so that he could pay for the wedding. Um, he does not communicate, but through his sign, it's just a matter of time before you figure out what he is saying. His, his sister and his mom usually know, so they are communicators, but it's just, they're communicators for them, put it that way. Um, they will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer.

But the problem was I had both hands full of papers and I didn't hold on to the braille, which I usually do. I'm usually careful. So I went flying around the corner, and as I turned the corner and hit the third step, uh, I slipped and fell backwards and hit the wall. And of course I fell flat on the landing. There I was. And I thought, well, I can get up, but I couldn't get up. There was no way I could get up. So there I was, and I, I guess I went in and out. I don't really remember, but I, there I was on the landing and I couldn't get up, but I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen and he's watching TV and maybe I'll be able to get up later and I won't tell him that I was so foolish just to come up the steps and fall.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:00    So I lay there a little bit longer and I woke up again and I couldn't get up. So I just laid there and I kept going in and out. And finally, sometime later, it was at least 30 minutes, he wandered by the door, and the door from the, from the floor was open down to the stairs. And so he looked at it and said, what are you doing down there? And I said, I can't get up. And he said, well, that will do. So he came down and he tried to get me up, and I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done, but I couldn't, I couldn't move. So he said, we need to call the ambulance. And I said, oh, no, I'll be able to get up. And he said, we really ought to call the ambulance. But my next door neighbor was a urologist, and her, his wife was a nurse.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    And I said, well, maybe you can call them. So he called them and they came over and the, the doctor looked at me and he said, call the ambulance <laugh>. So we called the ambulance, and then we called my daughter, who also lives in Lexington, and she met us at the hot, she came to the house. And so, and the ambulance came, and the fire truck came and we got us, and they brought us, they, they, uh, brought down because I had a, a neck injury, obviously I couldn't move my neck, couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body and they brought it in. And from each side of the, these two big burly men working on either side of me trying to get me up, and the, the landing wasn't all that wide. They finally got me up and they didn't want me to move it all. So they carted me up the stairs. And I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about ever since. They said to each other, she doesn't weigh as much as a six pack <laugh>. So this has been the joke with the whole thing. They got me up and we, they were absolutely  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Marvelous on the way to the hospital. They kept telling me where they were, and it wouldn't be too much longer because I really was in pain. And I got to the hospital, and of course they'd called ahead. They took me straight through to critical care, and they were, they were ready for me. And the rest of the night I was in and out. But I had marvelous care. I had marvelous people who were professionals who were working with me all night long, and they kept trying to check and be sure I didn't have any brain damage. I didn't have any nerve damage, but I had a broken neck. The second cervical was broken, so they, they'd had the, they had this cast on me the minute that they were there, they had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital.

Well, I've had a lot, um, my fair share, I guess difference, but the most, uh, recent, uh, was I discovered I had colon cancer last march, and, um, discovered it quite by accident. I had been sick a whole month of February with the flu, and it, when I finally got over the flu, had been on several antibiotics. Um, I still was running, um, a low grade fever and being nauseated at night. And, um, went on for a little while, but I, I still didn't think it was right. So I went back to the doctor. I think that was the fifth or sixth time I'd been in like four, four or five weeks. And, um, for whatever reason that he doesn't know, and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy and, um, thought that was kind of unusual. I had a ticket to Cal plane, ticket to California.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    And, um, so he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day. And he did find a surgeon who would, and, um, went in for the colonoscopy and, um, he kind of put you out. And when I got up off the table, I said, well, did you find anything? And he said, yes. And I said, cancer. And he said, yes. And I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday. And um, so Monday he explained to me the extent to what I had. Um, he thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. And, uh, so they scheduled the operation, believe it or not, two weeks down the road. And I said that, I'm going to California. I'm not gonna sit around here and worry about this, you know, two weeks.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:59    I just couldn't believe that in this day and age, that if you had cancer, they would schedule you two weeks down the road. Uh, the doctor called me that night and asked me some questions and, uh, which I thought was really unusual, uh, to have a doctor call you. That doesn't happen very often. And the next morning his nurse called me at seven from the hospital and they were doing surgery. She said, we can get you in Friday if you'll stay. And I said, well, if you can get me in Friday, then I'll stay. So, um, I was scheduled for surgery Friday and had it, and, um, he ended up taking my whole colon, although I left enough to hook everything back up, which was very fortunate. Um, but he thought he got it all, which of course is everybody's first question. And, um, so anyway, I was in the hospital. I don't remember.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Um, I was on morphine and kind of out of it, had trouble, had a lot of trouble with my, uh, iv and I was on, like I said, I was on morphine. So the, the IV thing kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on morphin, I guess. But anyway, they would let that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring. And it was driving us long. I mean, they'd wait 15 minutes and it's like a car door, you know, the dinging, dinging, dinging, dinging. And, uh, I, so every time I would want to sleep, that thing would wake me up.

She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than, than the, than the young girl that the, the man had. And, uh, when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife, was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the the gentleman's daughter, was really forced to do all the work in the house.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:18    And, uh, the, uh, daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day. And in fact, they, uh, made Cinderella sleep in the near the fireplace are in next to the fireplace. And she ended up being covered with, uh, ashes from the fireplace. So they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her time went on, and Cinderella's only friends really were the animals in the household, all of them, and including the, uh, dog and cat and nice, and even the rats were her friends. And, uh, so time went on and they, they all grew older, and they were in their, probably late teens maybe, when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman. And the stepsisters were not quite so beautiful, partly because they were mean and nasty. Um, so they lived in a, in a kingdom with a, uh, king who lived in a palace in the center of the city. And, uh, he had a son. And the king wanted his son, the prince, to marry. Well, the prince was, had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about. And the, uh, the prince or the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom. So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies of the kingdom would be invited. And, uh, uh, he and the prince would have a chance to  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Meet somebody that he'd like to marry. They hoped the, everybody received an invitation. The stepmother received their invitation and was of course, very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulders. She was excited. They, the stepmother told the three stepsisters, uh, about the ball, and they were excited. So, um, everybody was running around getting all, uh, prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes. And finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball. And Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find something that she herself could wear. Um, but of course, she couldn't find much of anything great. And so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the stepsisters laughed at her and said, you can't go to the ball looking like that. Nobody would want to see you. \n"}, {"job_id": "r4r44mnbHfGtVmam", "filename": "wright04a_2928612_3168170.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. The first, uh, problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese. So, um, it was frustrating. Um, I had to put children in school. I had to take them shopping to get their uniforms. I had to take a taxi and tell him where he wanted to go and how to get at home. And so how did I deal with it? I studied Japanese, uh, every morning, five days a week until I got, so I could do, it happened again when I went to Korea. It happened again when I went to Guatemala. So, and, and, and Brazil where they did not speak English. Uh, I spoke English in Jamaica and spoke English in Malaysia at that time. But the only time that I've really had what I call a serious communication problem is when I have been transported into a place where people don't speak my language and I have to communicate it and I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time. And I find I do it by reading body language, uh, reading facial expressions, um, and a lot of this, uh, moving hands and to describe what I want and then as, as the language picks up on my part, I have less of that to do. That's pretty much my experience with that. Alright.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:31    Um, were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:38    Yes. Okay.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:40    What happened? Tell me the story. Start from the beginning.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    Okay. I was on a boat, a ship I should say, and u s s president of mine was President Wilson. And we were sailing from, I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my, my husband and my two youngsters were there. Uh, they were probably third and fourth grade. And we came in, we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up. So, uh, the captain, you know, notified us there's a busy weather out there. And, uh, so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon started and the two of them met and our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. I was, uh, my children, one of them was thrown out of, uh, her bunk and, you know, hit her head on a, on a, on a wash basin. And I, we strapped them in something, I can't remember exactly 'cause I was miserable. I was seasick and I was on the, um, pro deck and they had storm windows up, so, because the problem you're supposed to be able to see, but they have these bad weather, big, thick windows up. And I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair because I could be watching the waves come up over me.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:22    And then I would hear crashing. And when we would go up real high, the ship would creak, it would go and then go down. I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life. They had, uh, ropes, uh, for people, you know, if you had to go to the bathroom or something, you couldn't walk. So you would do this to try and find your way. They had bedspreads pulled off all the beds that were in the pursers area. \n"}, {"job_id": "nXh5h1jvWwe6tLJp", "filename": "wright42a_467440_706986.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    <affirmative>.

And, you know, I actually was doing some interpreting for him because, you know, at one time or another, because I understood what he was saying. Uh, and that was, to me, it was probably the most difficult, uh, one that I had to deal with. Uh, not because I didn't understand him, but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him. Uh, but I also spent some time in Mexico and there's people down there that speak no English, so I've, you know, had to adapt. And I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish enough to get by.

The couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel, which we had planned to go see, you know, to go to the island of Cozumel and, you know, travel around there a little bit. 'cause there's some ruins there. It's a really nice place. Well, the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there, uh, apparently was an ex-marine or something. He was just a perfectly built. Um, and he had, they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab, they'd gotten near the port. I think they were doing, uh, one of the princess cruises or something. So they'd come into port and had been spent the day there, and then they had to get back to the ship. So they hired a cab, well, the cab starts going the other direction and he kept telling him, no, no, no, no, you're going the wrong way. The port's over here, you know, you need to go back this way. And, and  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:50    He wouldn't stop. And he kept saying not to worry, I know shortcut. It's okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:58    And he said he finally ended up, uh, convincing the guy that he better stop. Um, and he and his wife just jumped out of the vehicle as it was moving. And people in the neighborhood that they were, that they had jumped out of into, uh, started screaming about, you know, at yelling for the federalis because they knew that there was an abduction that was underway. Uh, so here we are, maybe a month away, not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this. We get there to Cosel and as soon as you get off the ferry, uh, there's all these cab drivers there and wanting to, you know, take you around the city or around the island. So this one come, you know, kind of, I dunno, it was kind of like, Hey, pick me type thing, you know, in our mind.

Meanwhile, the daughters, the stepdaughters, don't have to do anything, and Ci Cinderella works and works and works, and that's how she gets her name cinder Ella. Um, and because she's always dirty from working and, uh, Cinderella, you know, lives with an eye shot of the castle and always dreams of going to a ball there. And, uh, conveniently the king tells his son the prince, that he wants him to find a wife because they're gonna need someone else for the throne. And so the prince is like, well, I guess we'll have this grand ball and whoever I meet there and I fall for, uh, is who I'll end up marrying. So Cinderella had been working on this ball gown because they rec had received a letter that there was gonna be this ball, and she was like, oh my gosh, oh, my dreams can come true.

Her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her, um, their servant, basically. And, uh, everyone, they were very cruel to her. And she lived a very, um, eager life. And, um, but she was friends with all the animals. The, the animals were the people she got along with, the people she could talk to or the, the creatures that she could talk to.

And, uh, as it was time for him to marry and all, and Cinderella and their steps, her stepsisters were very excited to go. Um, however, Cinderella, uh, could not go unless she had finished all her chores. Her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish, and she said Cinderella could only go if she had finished all her chores first. Um, so, um, by the time, uh, it came to go, um, Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to, um, make a dress or prepare herself to go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:41    But, uh, unbeknownst to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores, using fragments of her stepsisters clothes and such that, uh, they had cast away 'cause they didn't want it.

And while the, the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it, um, Cinderella came rushing down the stairs, wearing her new dress, uh, very happy to go. Then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things that they had cast away. And, um, they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters.

So she went racing down the stairs, uh, leaving one of her glass slippers behind. Um, and she went racing off the carriage. And, uh, she actually didn't make it quite home. And, uh, when it started midnight and everything turned back to what it was, pumpkin, the carriage turned back into a pumpkin and everything went back to the way it was, except for one of her glass slippers.

So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters, but they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her, as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked the darella to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did. So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess. And the stepsisters were very excited about it, and so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and stepsister said, oh, well, you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:03    And it was a beautiful dress. And she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball. And when her stepsisters saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried, and the stepsisters went off to the ball, and alone came Cinderella's, very godmother. And she said, oh, well, you can go to the ball. And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters and Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball. She danced with the prince and had a wonderful time, but remembered that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were.

We had people stay with us when I was growing up, so I always knew that I wanted to do that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:54    And since I had taken French all through high school, I thought, oh, well go to a French speaking country. And France wasn't available, but Belgium was. So I chose Belgium and luckily I got to go there. I soon found out that learning, uh, high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium, <laugh>. So it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well, uh, because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English, so I had to learn French. And that's the best way to learn that I think. But it, it was, I, when I say it was life changing, it really kind of made me think about, first of all, that other people are not like us in the United States.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:42    And really got me thinking about how can I do what I do, um, as a speech pathologist, uh, in other countries. So I immediately came home and interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist. And they said, well, you gotta get your master's degree. Back then you, you didn't have to have your master's degree in, in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my master's and met my husband, got married, had children, that kind of thing. But it's always been something. I had a private practice, uh, when I was teaching as a full-time professor and, um, did some, a lot of international work that way. So I was doing telepractice before it was cool actually. And, um, got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and, and that kind of thing. So still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. Uh, I still keep in touch with my, some of my host families in Belgium and we've hosted kids from other countries for, for other programs as well. So, you know, I think, and I always encourage my children, I hope they will get to, um, if not study abroad, then, uh, travel a little bit more than I did growing up. It, it just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:04    Now these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them, tell me a story with the beginning, middle, and end. And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:16    So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:40    Take a look at these pictures that tell a story. Um, I'll ask you to tell me a story also with a beginning, middle, and end.

And one day her husband, I think, um, adopted or, or brought in a new child into the household. And the sisters or the sister, the, the three sisters, did not like this new child. And they commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and task and do their laundry and sweep the floors. But she console herself in her friendship with animals and be it horses or dogs, or even mice. Um, she was very friendly to animals. And so what she didn't, what love she didn't get from her sisters or other sisters in the household, she got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks. Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold, hold, hold, uh, a ball, and, and the household was invited to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:21    So Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited, but her sisters told her differently. And furthermore, they told her that she was not, not only not invited, but she was not appropriately dressed or could not, did not have a dress that would suit the occasion. So they left for the ball, and Cinderella was very, very sad. But here comes the fairy, the godmother fairy and says, what would you like to do, my child? And she says, I would like to go to the ball. So, but I don't have a dress. And the said, no problem. We're going to whip up a dress with my magic wand. And Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes, not only that, but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball. So she goes to the ball and impresses everybody, including the, the prince, the the king's son, um, who falls desperately in love with her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:32    But the theory had said, you must be back by midnight or you're gonna turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella hurries back and makes it back before midnight, but leaves behind a shoe. So the prince knew that the owner of a shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry, but where was she? She would nowhere we see it. So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe, and they had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfectly. And they went through the sisters. And even the mother tried her luck, but the shoe would not fit. And so no candidate was found to marry the prince until one of the animals told the, uh, surveyor that she should try it on Cinderella. And when the surveyor did that, the shoe fit Cinderella up perfectly. So the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball, and they lived happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:49    I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:55    Okay.

Uh, her stepmother had two little girls, uh, that were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat, and Cinderella had a dog. And Cinderella, uh, thought everything could be good, and her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up, the stepsisters, uh, really were not nice to Cinderella. They were evil stepsisters. Uh, they did things like, they made her do all the chores. They'd throw things at her, they'd make her clean the floors, clean the senders out of the fireplace, then make her take care of all the animals, including their cat. And their cat didn't like Cinderella. So that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were mice.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:18    So that was kind of a tough thing to do. Uh, Cinderella obviously was sad. So every night she would go to her room and she'd look out her window and she could see in the distance she could see the palace, and she looked at the palace and says, oh, I wish I could go there someday, just to see what it's like. So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Um, well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king and his right hand man, uh, would go through and try to figure out what el what was needed, because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well, he had a son who was a prince, but the prince did not have a wife, and he wanted the prince to have a wife before, uh, he would give him the kingdom. So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the, the village. And they sent out invitations to everybody. And the stepmother got the invitation and was reading it and Cinderella, Reddit over her back over her shoulder. And Cinderella thought, well, I'm a girl in the village. I get to go. And her stepmother didn't say anything, but her stepsisters were, no way, you can't  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Go, gotta have a, gotta have a ball gown. So she did her ball gown. Uh, she didn't have a ball gown that is, so she went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of, um, ball gowns that she could have. And she talked to her friends, the mice, and they took a dress that she had and they put bows and frills on it and things like that, and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need. I can go now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave. And when they saw her dress, they were upset. And one of the stepsisters ripped her dress, and one of them ripped her necklace off of her. And of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset. \n"}, {"job_id": "eKgfuc6pnVFGNCeo", "filename": "richardson21_1668821_1908210.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And no eight thanks to herself. Yep. I'm in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all. And she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite and then she collapses and the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm gonna be real, the first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like I can only like get a wedge out and then from there I can take proper bites. But apparently snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as in human beauty. So anyway, she collapses the apple rolls out of her hand, the crone caples maniacally as you are want to do and runs out. And then, I mean, I assume she like hobbles out 'cause she's still a crone. Maybe she turned, no, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:50    She should have turned herself back into the Queen 'cause she could have made a better getaway. But anyway, the old crone hobbles away and all the dwarves come high hoeing home and they see snow White passed out on the floor and they're like, again. But then they realize that she's not breathing too well or at all. And so they get on the backs of deer, I think. Like they ride deer to go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this crone. Presumably she just leaves a really obvious trail, but they follow her. And I don't know, there's a, there's a lightning storm or something I think, and the crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer. And deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her and like they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car specifically.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:50    And I believe it. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying. Um, but anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded men riding them. And so she's understandably freaked out and she climbs up onto this mountain and she's trying to hang onto the edge because she's about to fall and then lightning strikes the stick she's holding onto and the ground beneath her feet crumbles. And she falls presumably to her death, but probably not for sure. In case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development. They did that in Rapunzel and, and, uh, tangled Mother cough is probably dead. I hope she's dead. She was scary. Um, so the evil queen, as the crow falls to her death and all the dorks were like, well that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on Snow White. And so they raced back to Snow White, but she's still dead. And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical again. But this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin and they're mourning her. And there are flowers and tears and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Furry wildebeests crying. And suddenly the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion and he says, what the heck? The pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm gonna kiss her because that is the logical next step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her and she wakes up. I assume she like just hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple and took it out of her mouth. And that was censored. That seems logical because if he's gonna kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Um, go big or go home. Yeah. That's what happened. And so she sits up and thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her. 'cause otherwise she would've hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again. 'cause she does that a lot. \n"}, {"job_id": "mJsW8hlbFi9MDTE7", "filename": "wright89a_571113_810501.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and she lived with her dad. Her mom had died years ago, so it was just her, herself and her dad. And then one day her dad remarried and brought the new mom with two stepsister's home to meet Cinderella. And Cinderella was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom. Well, Cinderella and her dad really loved each other, and they were a family again with a new mom and, and two stepsisters. But then Cinderella's dad died, and the stepmom was not a very nice mom. And the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella. And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes and scrub the floor and make the beds and make the food. And they would not let Cinderella be part of the family.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all her, all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there. And she would look out her window and she could see far beyond the city, the castle. And she would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would wanna go and see. Well, meanwhile, there was the prince, and the prince wasn't married yet. And the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom. And so they decided to make a, uh, do a ball, which is a big dance, and they were gonna make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in the town come to the ball. And so the prince could pick one of the sisters or one of the, uh, single girls to be his wife.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:19    And so they sent out invitations and every home got an invitation for this big dance. And everybody was invited. And so the stepmother and the two stepsisters, they were so excited to go to this dance, and they were gonna dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family too. And the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you. You're shabby and you don't have any clothes to wear. And the stepmother said, if you do all your chores, you can go. And Oh, Cinderella. I was so excited that she was  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Able to go to the ball. And so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball. And so they made her a dress and it, oh, it looked so pretty. So the night of the ball, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball, and they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done. And here comes Cinderella, and she comes down the stairs and she goes, oh, wait for me, I can go too. And the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her and they were appalled. They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear. And they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her and they go, Cinderella, you can't go look at you. You look like you look like a little merchant and no prints would ever wanna look at you. And so they said you, they were off to the ball. \n"}, {"job_id": "P4BaW7cXKx7r53IZ", "filename": "richardson22_537900_777280.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, so, so the story of Cinderella is that her mom died and her dad remarried this really, really mean woman who had these really, really terrible daughters. And so they all move in together and I am assuming that her father had a little bit of money, or this old mean woman wouldn't be marrying him. But when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really, really me, Cinderella. So Cinderella is ma, she's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do. And so she's pretty much a slave. Again, I don't know where the dad is during all this, but so she works for a long time because in the story it showed her as a little girl. And then later on, it's like eight years later. So apparently this happened for a long time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:02    This girl is gonna need some help. So she is still working for the family. And then, um, she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such, and she looks out the window all the time, and then there's that castle and she's like, oh, that's where other people live, who I'm sure have a great life. So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife. I don't know, this sounds very crazy as I'm saying it, but it's true. So they had this dance so that the prince could find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently again, her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants. Um, but her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come, but she thinks she's gonna come.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:59    So she gets the try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that to help her get ready. And then the stepsisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book they take her necklace and tear her dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top. But they do and they're really mean. And so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubs a lamp in there. It's maybe she read a book. I don't, I don't remember that part. But anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So she asked her fairy godmother, I guess, to go to the dance. I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. Like this is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that like one night is gonna help. But anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So the very godmother like gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up, and then puts her in a pumpkin and sends her away. So she gets to go to the dance and um,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    It looks like she had a nose drop. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much, much smaller and her hair is much, much blonde when she goes to the dance. So something happens and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance and lo and behold, the prince falls in love with her. And so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off, which were last shoes. Anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken 'em off 15 minutes after getting there. So she lost her shoe. And then all the Prince knows is that girl that he loves wore this shoe. So, um, he sends his lacky guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe. And it's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit an issue. \n"}, {"job_id": "i2sO0Iiy3sE3rXTq", "filename": "wright82a_28630_267990.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay.

And I went in and my left side was just, felt like it was gonna explode. And I told my wife, I said, call 9 1 1. So she did, and it just, luck would have it. The ambulance was only five minutes away. So they got there and started work, and they were talking to the doctors and at their headquarters, and I heard the doctor say, don't try to bring him in the ambulance. We're sending a helicopter out. So they says, you got a good place, so you meet it on top of the hill with Mr. Ramsey in the ambulance. So they said, okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:58    So they loaded me in the ambulance and it was only about a half a mile to the top of the hill, and they just had got there when the helicopter landed.

I, I've never needed one. He said, okay. He said, I'll get one. So he just wait just a minute. He went back and he called this cardiologist and made an appointment for him to meet the helicopter at the emergency room door when they landed. And they did. And when they unloaded me off the helicopter at Good Samaritan Hospital, well he was there and he said, okay, we'll take him from here. So they took me in and started checking me over and I heard him say, yes, he has a, a major heart attack.

Um, the way that the, um, that the playing field is set up is, um, there's a diamond, um, and there's four bases at each point of the diamond. Um, the, the, the diamond is on one point, um, and such that the, the, the bottom point is called home plate and then going counterclockwise around the clock, there's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate. Um, the team that is in the field and is on defense, they're allowed to have gloves, um, and there's a ball that, uh, that, that is in play. Um, the other team that is trying to score the runs at that point is, has a bat, and they have some protective equipment, including helmets and such.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    Um, the way that the, um, that the game starts is one team, um, is on defense. So they take the field, um, and there's certain positions for each player. Um, there's nine active players per side. So the defensive team has nine players out in the field. Um, the offensive team has one bat player, um, that starts at home plate, and he's called the batter. Um, the team that is in the field first is the visiting team, um, to the, to the stadium. The home team, I take it back, the visiting team backs first. The home team is on the field first. Um, the way that the game is set up, um, there are nine, what are called innings, and an inning consists of, um, where each team gets to bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, um, the, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs, and then they switch sides where the, the home team then comes to bat and the visiting team then is in the field.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:08    Um, and then they get three outs. Once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning, and you do nine of those sets. Um, in the defensive position, there's the, you know, there's several, um, different positions. There's nine positions. Um, one of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher. Um, and then at home plate is the catcher. And then we go around, we go have a first baseman, a second baseman, a third baseman. There's someone that stands between third and second base called a shortstop. And then beyond the diamond is a, is a field behind the diamond where three other players, um, hang out and, and, um, their goal, the defensive goal is to e there's two ways you can make an out. You can, um, catch the ball in the, in the fly. Actually three ways in the out now catch the ball on the fly. If the, if the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The ball towards home plate, the batter hits it. Um, if the batter hits the ball and, uh, someone in the field catches it for, it hits the ground. Um, that is one L. Um, there's something called balls and strikes where if the batter misses with his bat, um, and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the, and the actual physical base at home plate, that's called a strike. It's outside that, um, lateral movement. It's called a ball. You get three strikes and your, or your, the battery is out. Or if you get four balls, then the battery gets a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out. If the batter makes it to first base before the throw gets there, he gets to, he's safe on first base. \n"}, {"job_id": "vhEB5mvxicxdWHi3", "filename": "capilouto42a_612000_851310.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Cinderella's dad, um, got remarried.

So Cinderella, um, did spend a lot of time with the animals outside, besides working, sweeping up cinders and, and cleaning the house and doing things for her stepsisters who seemed to spend a lot of time on their looks, looking in the mirror and, and fixing themselves up. One day, they all had an invitation from the prince to go to a ball at the castle. So, uh, of course, Cinderella was not going to be allowed to go. She didn't have the clothes to do it, but the ugly stepsisters were dressed up, and the stepmom was two, and they all left for the ball. Cinderella was sad, but she accepted it, and along came her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother brought out her magic wand and, uh, tapped different things.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:23    Pumpkin turned into a coach and, and the mice turned into to, um, I don't know, carriage men, I don't know what they're called. And Cinderella had a beautiful gown and pretty glass slippers that, and then they all went to the ball, and the only stipulation was that at midnight she would have to return to her Cinderella state. So she went to the ball, and the prince and Cinderella danced, and he was very taken with her, with not only her beauty, but her manners. She was a very sweet person. And she looked up at the clock and the clock was getting ready to strike midnight. So she ran down the stairs and lost one of her slippers, her glass slippers. And we returned to her house where, where she was, again, quiet in her old clothes. And the, the carriage and the carriage men returned to their mice and pumpkin status. And when her step mama and stepsisters came home, they were raving about the ball that they had gone to. And Cinderella didn't say that she had gone, so she went back to, to her normal life. In the meantime, the Prince, uh, was trying to find Cinderella.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    She had disappeared so rapidly and he wanted to be able to see her again. So he sent out on a search for her with his man servants, and they came to, uh, I don't know what her stepmother's name was, but they came to their ho home. And the ugly stepsisters, of course, um, thought that they would fit into the, the glass slippers and whoever did was going to, of course, be part of the prince's life. So, uh, they couldn't fit into it. And he went out and Cinderella was outside and he stopped to, to try it on Cinderella. And lo and behold, the slipper fit. So Cinderella, uh, and the prince were married and went away from the stepmother and step sisters, and lived happily ever after. \n"}, {"job_id": "J1Vy2ru8ACesSa9f", "filename": "NEURAL5-2_896413_1135721.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Ferdinand was sitting in isolation in his home because it was during the Coronavirus pandemic when all of a sudden the soccer ball came through the window, knocked over the lamp beside him.

She wasn't happy with him, but he refused and said goodbye. Well, as he was walking to school, sure enough, it started to rain. By the time he got to school, he was pretty wet, and he spent the day drying out his shoes in school, and he got his chair wet, but it all dried out eventually. But by the time he got was ready to come home, it was not only raining, it was pouring, and there were puddles on the sidewalk. He stepped into all those puddles. He ran in the rain to get home as fast as he could. By the time he got home, he was drenched and his mother could not help herself.

Her cat had run out and, and run down the street, but she got off her tricycle because the cat not only had run down the street, the cat ran up the tree and her cat would not come down. Well, pretty soon she called for her dad, and her dad got out the ladder. Her dad started climbing up the ladder. He climbed up the tree, trying to get the cat, but while he was sitting on the tree trying to reach the cat, their dog came running out into the yard and knocked the ladder over. Barking, barking, barking up the tree at dad. So then not only could dad not reach the cat, but dad couldn't get down because the dog had knocked over the ladder.

If anything happens, I can hold it over my head and I won't get as wet. So I'm not gonna take the umbrella. I'll be fine. I know sooner it got down the road than wouldn't, you know. Lo and behold, it started to rain. The rain turned into a torrent and I was actually getting very soak soaked from head to toe. My backpack was wet, my shoes were even wet.

Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:26    A young girl whose parents had died. She had an aunt, but her aunt was a very bitter person. So she and the children, her children, her daughters were living in the house, but Cinderella was basically treated as the house made. She had to keep the house cleaned up no matter what. As she grew older, she grew more and more beautiful, but even as beautiful as she was, she was still just the housemaid. The other girls grew up. They weren't near as beautiful as she was. In the meantime, the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married. And to do that, he wanted to have a great ball. He sent out invitations to all the, the influential people within the land that they would could attend the ball. Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation and had decided to send her two daughters. Cinderella said, well, can I also go? And they and her mother said, no, you can't. You're to stay here and keep this place clean. So while she was doing that, she was, became a little bit disconcerted and her at all. At once. She started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:16    Because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once. Her fairy godmother came to see her and she asked what she really wanted, and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball. So her fairy godmother waved her wand and gave her the most beautiful dress in a tiara and glass slippers to wear, to take her off to the ball. She had to have a coach. So she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin. \n"}, {"job_id": "zdc8y6qndomi3SYN", "filename": "NEURAL39-2_261993_501278.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So I think, I don't know, that's, sorry. It's the same answer.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:07    Okay. So for your next prompt, um, I would like you to tell me a story about something important that happened in your life. This can be a happy story, sad from any time childhood up until more recently. Just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about. And you can take time to think if you'd like.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:29    I was gonna say, 'cause I'm gonna try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injury stories. What was an important, as soon as I hang up from you, I'll go. Why do you not tell her that <laugh>? What is important? Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things, um, is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries, um, or light life stopping moments as I have when that hit last January. And she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU Health. Um, that went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so. And  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:29    Oh my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that. I'm not sure who was gonna bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work. She had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to, um, I guess Jackie was still there at that point. And Mark and she, when I called her, she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the er, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get, um, intravenous. Um, then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth if that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not, and Mark did take her to the er.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:33    They did release her. It wasn't long after that IU then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying. And then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know, that they need you. So it was a decision whether to hop a plane that night and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie, it was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day. And we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was our chauffeur for the entire time we were in the doctor's office. And he admitted her into the hospital, um, for that night. And the surgery was the following night. I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night, which I was glad that I did because she was with it, but not really with it. But staying there with her for a few days afterwards, um, she was a trooper, but none of my children have really been sick. So to be so far away and not be able to, um, be there immediately. So all turned out good, but as you know, there's still issues. \n"}, {"job_id": "WEKqL7qFvGWarKvG", "filename": "Baycrest12073a_677599_916871.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Here we go.

I was in The Bahamas this time with, uh, friends from the sailing club, and we met, well, the month of February spoken into three 10 day shifts where people would meet at the boat. And a few people were there for the whole month because they had, they were retired and had enough time and money to do it. But the rest of us, uh, were there for 10 day periods.

And I've been on other trips like this before, but this one was, this one was really good. It was a catamaran, which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between.

And he was, he was like in his thirties, uh, going on twenties at one of the people because he was kind of goofy. You never know what to expect from him. He was kind of not grown up in some ways, but he was also about six two with a Scandinavian looking with blonde hair and blue eyes, except his hair was in dreadlocks, <laugh> and Hussel had some, uh, history of, of, uh, smuggling people and smoke and booze and stuff in The Bahamas.

And the nurse came in later and she said, I could hear her talking. That's it. She was saying, boy, she fell asleep sitting up. And I thought, I'm not asleep, I'm just gaga, <laugh>, you know? And that, that's pretty much it. And I, I remember the, the, uh, therapy afterwards and, and the pain and the, and the medication of the Vicodin. And I remember, uh, saying things that didn't make sense  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And having a conversation on a telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to deliver the new cabinets that my son-in-law was putting in my kitchen. And, um, I remember asking him, I had just taken Vic, and I remember asking him, now, who are you? And I knew very well who he was, and he would answer very slowly. And I thought, oh, he's ha he's, he's, he's trying to, you know, humor. And I'd say, why am I ask you these stupid questions, <laugh>? And I was right. And I said, now let me, I could hear myself say, now, let me write this down. And so in due course, about three hours later, these men showed up and I was back, you know, sort of, and I said, hi.

And it was like a week long and it would always be, one would be in the United States and the second one of the year would be outside the United States. And this year it was going to be in San Francisco. And, um, it'll be 20 years ago, next month. And, um, my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening, and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a lot of the background work and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working, uh, week. And so Don stayed here and my sister from Dallas, uh, flew in and that was the week that they had the San Francisco earthquake. And, um, so we were at Fisherman's Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free. And um, we were waiting to go, uh, on the trolley car back to, um, St. Francis, the Western St. Francis.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    And as we're waiting in line, the earthquake hit. And um, it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that. And so my sister, just being the big sister, she always tried to calm me down and she said that was probably a two or three. And how she came up with that, I have no idea, because we never were in an earthquake, so we didn't know. But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off, so nothing worked. And so we walked 18 blocks back to our hotel. And, um, in San Francisco, you know, it's pretty hilly. And so, um, I mean it was, it was, uh, quite a jaunt back there and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel. So we sat outside this big, uh, park area, um, for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And, uh, the first thing that my sister and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    I wanted to do was, we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there and we wanted to also call our two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called mother, who never watches news. She doesn't like to hear, uh, the bad news, and there's hardly any good news that's told. So we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know, but my sister said, mother, what are you doing? And she said, well, I'm watching the news because so and so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco. So it was a lot of fear at the beginning. We were on the 19th floor, so we had to walk up to the 19th floor and then walk down with our luggage.

And I got to the hospital and had, was already, you know, at like eight or something. So there were very few options for me except to just have the baby. And I did. And I just remember her coming out and, uh, looking like this little mochi chi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And she was so brown, her hair was so brown, and she had this brown hair all over, and I had light hair and her dad has light hair.

I remember everything about it. And then bringing her home, nothing was the same ever again. So it's like you rem I remember every detail and then my whole world just, you know, she was always there then. And then it was like she was never not there. And then her brother, um, I was nervous to have, because it was so traumatic for me to have grace because she, like I said, came so fast.

And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember, uh, my gynecologist like, you know, you had a very quick firstborn.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    This is gonna happen again. And I sat, I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks. And all I could think was, when is this gonna happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain gonna come back? And, um, that's not how it worked at all actually. I, I, he was also born on his due date. So now we've determined it's me who has to have things in the right place. Um, but we rode to the hospital. I checked myself in. It was so calm, it was the exact opposite. And he came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face.

All the mice and the horses and the dogs and the cats, everyone loved her so much.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:36    Well, up at the castle there was a prince, and the king, who was the prince's father, decided it was time for the prince to get married. So he and his advisors decided to have a ball for the prince to meet all the eligible women in the kingdom so he could pick his bride. So they sent out invitations to the whole country for everyone with eligible brides or girls to come to the ball. Cinderella's house got an invitation too, and everybody was so excited. Both stepsisters thought it would just for sure be her that the prince would choose. So they used Cinderella to help 'em get ready to get their dresses, get everything ready.

They made her a dress and did her hair and got her all ready to go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:28    And she ran downstairs to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go.

And lo and behold what appeared. But her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother said, Cinderella, you can go to the ball. And she used magic to make her a new dress and to turn the mice in a footman and to turn the pumpkin into a carriage. And off she went to the ball in the brand new dress that the fairy godmother had made by magic, for her, especially it's important, was she was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet. So she went to the ball, and the minute she entered the ball, the prince had eyes for no one but Cinderella.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:19    And they danced and they danced and they danced, and they had a wonderful time. Uh, but then the clock struck midnight and the fairy godmother had worn Cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight. So the clock started striking midnight and Cinderella had to run before the prince saw that she wasn't really a princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella. She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away. But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home and the prince was sad, but he knew he had her glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside for whose ever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fitted would become his bride. And they went around and no one's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to Cinderella's house. Both stepsisters tried, but their feet wouldn't fit. Finally, they tried it on Cinderella and her foot fit perfectly, and she and the prince got married and lived happily ever after. <laugh> the end.

His sinuses were always a mess, so we kind of thought it was that, you know, he was vomiting mostly in the morning, in, uh, fall of 2010. And, um, so we, he went on antibiotics, got a little bit better, so we thought everything was okay. You know, after a week or so, it started to go badly again.

Um, and the, the operatic vocals that are consistent between the two of 'em. So that was awesome. We get into to the CT scan. He does it, the phone rings out in the waiting room, and it's the radiologist. And, um, first he says, who is this? And I tell him, he's like, well, I didn't mean to talk to you <laugh>. He was trying to call the pediatrician and inadvertently actually got me. It was clear that he didn't wanna break in, in retrospect, it was clear that he didn't wanna break the news.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:05    Um, the pediatrician called back and, and, um, then said that he, they'd found a, uh, three and a half centimeter tumor in the back of his head.

So we just had to pack up stuff, take him to Riley. He underwent brain surgery the next day. Um, we were <laugh> prior to brain surgery for cancer. They, they took us out for the consent and, uh, the residents telling me about this, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Potential complication called posterior fossa, mutism, which is a rare complication based, uh, on, um, the location of the tumor. And, uh, that in rare cases it meant that the, the chi, he wouldn't be able to speak for a little while afterward. I mean, the, which is funny, not funny. I mean, he has to get consent, but like, what choice do you have? Well, I don't want him to not have to speak for a little while, so I'm just gonna let him have cancer in his brain. It'll be fine. What could go wrong? Um, so, you know, he did, he does it. Um, it, it, what what I learned was that posterior fossa, mutism is just kind of an old, uh, archaic almost way of, of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior foss mutism, uh, or posterior fossa syndrome, which is more than mutism. \n"}, {"job_id": "FXort9YpWWfa9plP", "filename": "UMD20_283809_522884.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, <laugh>.

So they cooked up a scheme to have a ball.

So she was able to go to the ball, but the provision was that she must, must leave. At midnight, she went to the ball and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated, and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love. Midnight came and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she had to be out of there. So she hurried away, and in her hurrying, she lost one slipper, which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her. Um, she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth. But she managed to get home anyway. And, um, later the, um, the prince was very depressed. He had fallen in love with this woman, and she had disappeared. All he had left  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Was a glass slipper, and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else. So the, his father, who I guess was the king and the minister of marriages, um, went from house to house with the prince, with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on. And of course, it would not fit anyone at all, including the two unpleasant stepsisters. Even though I believe in one story, one of them cut off a toe in order to fit, try to fit in, but it still didn't work. And it got blood all over the place. But finally, the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper, was Cinderella.

Fox, she just, um, she kind of has like the bobbing of the head and whatnot and she's very emotional <laugh>, which she never was before. So it's kind of like, you never know if you say, I think it's gonna rain today, if that will make her cry, <laugh> or not. So, um, what I have found with her, um, whereas we have always, she doesn't live in my same time town, so we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything. And without physically seeing her face, I have to like start the conversation slow and see where she's at in her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues or if this conversation will just be about nothing.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:19    You know? So I've had to do a lot more, um, listening to her and listening to the cues versus, um, normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, oh my gosh, this happened today and you just start rambling. But I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her. Now <laugh>. So she takes it all to heart. So for me, I just, I've really had to kind of let go of part of our relationship because I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's gonna upset her or not. And it's sad, but, so getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody 'cause she doesn't do FaceTime or anything, which to me that would be a clear indication. I can read her face a lot better, but, so asking the right questions and just listening a lot more,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:26    I'd like you to think about something important that happened in your life and I would like you to tell me a story about this event. Um, it can be happy or sad from childhood up to now. Anything that stands out in your mind that you would like to tell a story about.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    Okay. Um, okay. I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. Um, I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy, so I really don't go to the doctors. I don't like to go to doctors. And that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I just, I didn't read a lot about it, <laugh>, I just went through it because I mean, I was fine the whole way. And then when we got to the hospital, I didn't, I had to be induced. So, I mean, I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know <laugh> know what I was signing up for. But, um, when we walked into that hospital, I mean, I got panicked because I didn't know anything <laugh>. And, um, my mom was there. She came up and um, she saw my doctor <laugh> and I remember the first thing she said, she goes, your doctor's as old as you are <laugh>. And she was, she was only like a couple years older than me, but I really didn't think anything about it, about it. And um, then I started getting nervous. I thought, well, I wonder how many babies she's still living. \n"}, {"job_id": "xWsUn7szTeFsccL1", "filename": "richardson21_1189250_1428260.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Like, she doesn't know what to do with her arms anyway, so Snow White is working as a servant, and the evil queen goes up to the mirror and says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still Snow white. That hasn't changed. And so the Evil Queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do, because that seems like a very narrow-minded and not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:39    Anyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point, the Queen says to herself, well, I guess I can't do anything, gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well, so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so dang lonely, and she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life, um, she's wishing for the one she loves, even though I'm not sure she has like a true grasp of what that would actually entail. But basically one day she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet, which is kind of creepy. He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself, I'm wishing I'm wishing for the one I love.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:32    And then creepy Prince comes in and goes today out of nowhere and it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet. But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life, and she's terrified rightly. And so the Prince goes away and she goes back to her lonely life. And this is the point at which the Queen is like, well, clearly I need to kill her. This is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this Huntsman and says, Huntsman, you're gonna kill Snow White. You're gonna bring me her heart as proof.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like snow whites. It's not like Snow White has a sewn on label that says Property of Snow White on her heart. But that's not the point. The Queen is clearly a little bit few fries short of a happy meal. So the Huntsman goes out and he chases snow white a little bit through the woods, and then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure, he could never kill her. And so he falls to his knees in supplication and he says, I'm so sorry. And he drops the knife and snow white's like, and then he says, run away and I will cover for you, but you better run away and never come back because the queen is gonna kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the Huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest. And he brings the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Heart of a wild boar to the queen and says, look, queen. This is snow white's heart. The heart of a wild boar doesn't look like a human heart. The queen is stupid, basically. And the queen says, ah, yes, cook that into a meal for me. And then she proceeds to eat this boar heart thinking that it's snow white's, which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids. I don't know about you. Um, so Snow White has fled into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her, and she's making weird faces again. And eventually she makes it to this cottage where she breaks in breaking and entering also a common theme in these stories. Um, she breaks in and she sees it's kind of dusty and kind of gross, but she sees all in a little row, a bunch of little beds, like for people who are maybe three feet tall, if that. And she says, well, I'm gonna crash on one of those beds later. I guarantee it. \n"}, {"job_id": "OJRGlCKl0VJPP4oO", "filename": "richardson198_23685_262676.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

So she got her dad to try to get the cat from the tree. And while doing so, his ladder fell down and their neighbor's dog came and started barking at the tree.

The father met another woman that he wanted to marry, who happened to have two daughters. Um, the stepsisters were snobs and, um, uh, then the father died.

Um, they were not very kind to Cinderella. They did not welcome her into the home. Um, Cinderella had to do, um, all the chores around the house. She was kind of like a maid and, um, very isolated. So she made friends with all the animals around the house, um, and learn to enjoy life that way. One day they got a notice, um, from the, the royal castle that there was gonna be a ball that the prince needed to find, um, a significant other. And there was gonna be a royal ball. And Cinderella and the stepsisters and the mother were, were all very excited, um, to go to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    But it turns out that Cinderella was not going to get to go to the ball. They made it, uh, the stepmother made it so that she had chores and, and things to do and was not gonna be able to go. Um, and she also didn't have anything to wear. So, um, she got all of her chores done, and, um, all the animals, the mice and all the animals helped to make her a dress to wear to the ball. And she got all ready to wear the dress. And, um, the ugly stepsisters tore it up and ripped all of her things off, and, and she didn't have anything to wear, so she wasn't gonna get to go to the ball. And she was outside upset, crying because of it, and suddenly appeared a fairy godmother who used her magic wand to make, um, Cinderella a beautiful ball gown.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    And, um, and she had a horse and a carriage to ride to, to the ball inn. And she went to the royal ball and, um, and danced with the prince, and he fell in love with her. And, um, they were having their night of romance. And, and, um, suddenly she remembered that, um, her fairy godmother told her when the clock strikes 12, the spell would be broken, that she put on her with all, and her, she would lose her fancy dress, and then her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin, um, and her clothes would go back to her normal raggedy clothes. And so she ran off and left the prints. But when she ran off one of, she had on silver slippers, glass slippers, and one of them, she stepped out of one and left him on the, the stairway going down from the castle. And so, um, she went back home and the spell broke and everything turned back  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    To, to normal, and she went on about her business. But, uh, she still had one glass slipper and then one left behind. So, um, again, the, the palace sent out a notice to everybody in the community that the prince was going to try to find his love, and he was going to go around to all the houses that had young women and them, and have them try on the glass slipper to see if, um, who to find his, his love and see who it was that left that slipper behind. Well, um, the ugly, the, the stepmother let locked Cinderella in her room. And the ugly stepmothers tried to, when they, when the people came by to, um, for the girls in that house to try on the slippers, the stepmother locked Cinderella in her room, so she couldn't do it in the ugly stepmothers tried or stepdaughters, tried to get their feet in the shoe. \n"}, {"job_id": "BYPZ8tDsgxvtLbmS", "filename": "NEURAL18-2_30857_269846.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    When I was in third grade, I remember getting the chickenpox, and I remember because I was at my friend Heather Schilling's house, and we were in the bathroom and she discovered she had chickenpox.

And I got the chickenpox and I remember feeling really weak and lethargic, and I would be just on the floor. We had a, a room that was like a, a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it. And I just slept on the floor and I wasn't experiencing any, any pain or terrible itching yet. Uh, but that did come. And I remember feeling my mom would create this like mixture of some kind of paste that she would put on my, the, you know, on the, the chickenpox.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    And I think that it was like, I wanna say like baking soda and water or it was some combination of something like that. And it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store. And she probably was not gonna do that because in order to save money <laugh>. Um, but it worked. I, I do remember that. And, and I remember she would put me in the bath with, uh, that oatmeal kind of mixture and it was very soothing. And then after the bath would put this, again, this paste or this mixture on the different spots. Um, but even though those things helped me physically feel better, the thing that I, I remember about when I started to feel better, like really feel better, is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff stickers and we had sticker books and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers, and I focused on my sticker book instead of the chickenpox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the, you know, the kind of itching and scratching and, uh, it put me in a better mood. So I was in as lethargic.

So I have a teenage daughter and, um, I know that they say that teenagers can be difficult to communicate with in general. Um, but she also has a personality type that is very private. And, um, I would say she withholds communication, withholds things, not, not out of, you know, lying or any ill will or anything bad. She just only gives as much information as she thinks other people need to have, which is very frustrating as a parent because I wanna know more about what her day is like. \n"}, {"job_id": "YqQ8hwMu9bpY5wbA", "filename": "wright01a_2171473_2410462.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, this is a story about Cinderella who was kind of, um, young girl and she had a stepmother and two stepsisters that she was in.

We'll make it so you can go and everything. I'll fix everything with my magic wand <laugh>. Anyway.

And she, you know, ran down the steps to get to her, you know, coach and that, and she dropped one shoe. They were like glass slippers, you, uh, so she dropped one and he picked it up and then she was gone, you know, I mean, she had to get home and everything turned back to normal.

So the fairy godmother creates the, um, the carriage to take her in and the horsemen and the dress and everything, and is perfect. And, and her fairy godmothers then help her, um, to go to the bowl.

Um, but she leaves probably for a good plot point, uh, and returns back home, uh, as herself, uh, not in her like gallon dress, uh, but she left behind a glass slipper, uh, which the Prince finds. Um, and the prince, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Is mystified by her and decides that he's going. He has to go and find out who she is. So he roams the land, fitting a shoe onto fair maiden's, trying to figure out if they're the one who he danced with, because apparently he just can't remember her face. I guess he just can only remember her shoe size. Uh, but eventually he arrives at the, at Cinderella's house where the evil stepmother has like locked her in a building. Uh, this part's from the movie though, I don't know if it was in the book. Uh, and then like the animals, like help her get out of the room and then she shows up downstairs when the princess like fitting the shoe onto of the stepsister's feet and like their feet are like way too big and like are squishing in. Um, so he's like disgusted and then he sees her and like kind of instantly knows it's her, but then like has to put the shoe on. 'cause once again, I guess he can't just remember her face. Um, and then shoe fits, they fall in love. And then evil stepmothers. \n"}, {"job_id": "HI5AFSDHb5nPjd99", "filename": "NEURAL15-1_935226_1174140.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    When Cinderella was a young girl, her mother had passed away.

When Cinderella was a child, her father had remarried after her mother had passed away, and her new stepmother and two stepsisters moved in with them, the, as they got older, the step-sisters became meaner and meaner to Cinderella, making her do all the household chores and doing everything for them. Cinderella had no life of her own, so spent a lot of time with all the, uh, farm animals, telling them stories of how she would like to meet Prince Charming. Then one day it was announced that Prince Charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife. So Cinderella got excited, cited, saying she would go to the ball and make a beautiful dress and meet Prince Charming. At the same time, the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball, also talking of how they would marry Prince Charming and live, live a wonderful life with him too.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    So the night of the ball, Cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made, put on some jewelry and did her hair, and was walking out when the stepsisters said, where do you think you're going? And Cinderella says, I'm going to the ball. And they ripped her dress to pieces and tore her jewelry off and messed up her hair so she couldn't go to the ball as they left and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her. Cinderella was so upset that she couldn't go to the ball any longer, and she sat outside and cried. All of a sudden, a fairy godmother came along and said, what are you crying for? And she said, I can no longer go to the ball. My dress is all torn and I have nothing else to wear. And the fairy godmother said, oh, dear, let me take care of that for you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    And with the wave of her wand, she gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo, and she has some beautiful glass slippers. And Cinderella said, thank you, fairy godmother, but now how will I get there? And so the fairy godmother says, well, here's a coach for you to take you to the ball, but you have to leave at midnight, or it'll turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella says, oh, no problem. I'll be home by midnight. Thank you so much. So off to the ball. She goes in her, in her carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers. Cinderella gets to the ball and is in awe of how beautiful it is. And she sees Prince Charming. And Prince Charming sees her immediately and comes over to her and asks her to dance. And so they, they dance for hours. And then Cinderella hears the clock strike midnight, and she gets worried and says, oh no, I have to leave. And she immediately runs out the door, and as she's running to the, to the carriage, she loses one of her slippers and doesn't have time to go grab it. So she jumps in the carriage and the carriage takes her off, off into the distance, leaving Prince  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Charming to wonder who the beautiful woman was. So when Cinderella's home, all she can dream about is her night at the ball, and how wonderful it was.

So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on, on all the women to see if he can find her for him when he gets to, um, Cinderella's house. The stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try the slipper on all the women, so they're convinced that they will fit. One of them will fit into the slipper.

Um, due date was January, January 18th and first baby, the baby was not born. We did not find out the sex. And even back then you could, I wanted to be totally surprised. I love surprises. So on January 18th, I had still not had the baby and had a, a scheduled checkup with the, um, OB doctor and assumed it would be my last, um, visit. Anyway, went in after work. My husband met me because first child, he was at all the appointments.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    Um, and I am like, well before I moved to Florida, very fair and, um, tall and fair. Tall and what was the other thing? Never like a muscular kind of person. So anyway, the whole time I'm carrying this baby, which by the way, first baby, this baby barely moved. And I had, comparatively to the second, I had nothing. I thought it was fine because what did I know? Nothing. And, um, every time I would push my stomach, I would say, oh, she, 'cause my mother had three girls and my other sister had three girls and my other sister had a girl. So I would say, oh, she's gonna have a really firm, but this is wonderful. So last visit, last checkup, he does an internal and he is like, ah, why don't we go across the hall? I wanna do a, um, a scan or I don't know what it, what they called it at the time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    And he says, yep. He goes, just what I thought. And I was like, what? You know, 'cause I'm cloud. Like, it was just such an exciting time. He goes, um, the baby is um, not in position, so you're gonna have a C-section. And I was like a C-section. That was one of my two secret secret fears of having a baby. I was like, absolutely not. You can flip this baby, you can do this, you can do that. He's like, your first pregnancy. We really dunno why the baby didn't drop. I can't see. I guess that was another thing on the, on the image. He couldn't see the cord or I said a little bit, we don't really know how long the cord is. He gave me every reason this baby was not gonna be flipped. So, you know, there's lots of things out there.

But anyway, Monday, it was a Thursday, Monday I was scheduled for my C-section. So on Friday I went for all my blood work. That was the only day I missed of work. I worked a full day on Thursday, missed Friday, and she was scheduled to be, the baby was scheduled to be born on Monday and Sunday night. Um, I went to bed and my water broke and I was so excited because then I felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready. It's not like c-section, like just ripping this baby out. So I was like all excited. And we were in Michigan by ourselves, so I didn't wake up my husband, I decided to go get my bag and I got everything ready by the door before I woke him up.

So I was sewing on a jacket with a little tiny one eighth seam. And as I was moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the needle and you know, it does that and I yanked it. So the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer and he said he was gonna pull it out and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital and they had to remove my fingernail and slice my finger open, take out the needle, and then x-ray because they had little splinters of, um, metal in there, X-ray that, and then sew it back up.

It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? Okay, great.

Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:35    I was special needs teacher for 10 years and still go. Um, and so does Becca for that matter, still go to Eagle once a year with them and there are usually seven to eight that go and we chaperone and they have classes, but three of them are brothers of which only one can speak. The others you have to, um, follow their, uh, hand communication. It's not that they sign language, but they try to, 'cause it's more in the grunting, um, aspect of interesting enough, usually her, his mom knows what he's referring to. Um, so I would say it's, it's more being patient and they eventually get their story out by pointing by, um, doing the same thing over or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you.

So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince. He just wants to dance with her all night when she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight. Oh, goodness. So she turns and races out of the ball, and in a hurry to get away, she drops. One of her glass slippers, falls off of her foot, hops into her carriage, and has a race away. But right at the stroke of midnight, the horses change back into mice. The carriage changes back into a pumpkin, and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen.

And they manage just to get the bead stuck on Jasper's tail and slide under the door. And they're safe. And the birds help, and the mice help. And they get the dress made up real pretty. This sing is on. We can do, we can do da da, we can. So they get this song going and they get the dress made and Cinderella comes in the attic and they surprise her with this beautiful dress. And she's so happy she can go to the ball. So she puts on his dress and runs down the stairs and tells her stepmother and the, and her stepsisters to wait 'cause she could go to the ball knock 'cause she has nothing to wear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    And she's finished all her chores. And the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks in her beau beautiful dress. And they see that the decorations are stuff that she quote unquote stole from their garbage. So they start ripping their beads and their sashes back 'cause they want them back. And they leave her and torn rags as they trot off to the ball. Cinderella goes running to the garden and she starts crying 'cause she wanted to go to the ball. And this fairy godmother appears and does this Ty boo thing, whips up a real pretty white dress. And then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footman and the mice and beautiful white horses. And she tells them to out to go dance with the prince. But she has back by midnight, the spell wore off. So Cinderella goes the ball and she meets the prince.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:00    And everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with. And she hears the clock strike midnight, and she has to go. And the prince is like, but wait, but wait. I don't even know your name. And she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach, which will certain be a pumpkin. And as she's running down the stairs, one of her shoes falls off and she gets in the coach, and the coach takes her home and she arrives just in time for the coach, turned back into a pumpkin and the horses turned back into the mice and dog the footman turns back into a dog. And the next day she's walking around in the house and she hears the, the Duke come to the door and says, the princess fallen in love and chosen is bribe, but he doesn't know who she is. So he's going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that the Cinderellas left, this maiden's left behind.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    So he ends up going to Cinderella's house and she hears the Duke come into the door and she goes to her room and the stepmother locks her in her room, puts the key in her pocket, and goes downstairs to welcome the Duke into the house. The Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters. And her foot is too small. And as the mother's sitting there, the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go wash your Cinderella. And again, they run into the cat, but they escape the cat again. They go underneath the door and they hand the key to Cinderella and she unlocks the door. And as she's leaving, the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister. And one stepsister is too small. The other one's foot was too big. And as he's leaving, Cinderella runs down the stairs and says, but wait, I, I wanna try the shoe on. And the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderella's, the one the prince was dancing with. \n"}, {"job_id": "4kIy1pmgHPaYzFCA", "filename": "richardson191_47701_286491.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So Billy was at a soccer game and, uh, when he got home he was so excited 'cause he scored a few goals and he decided to keep practicing and he kicked a soccer ball and it went through the window and hit his dad on the knee.

Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:31    Um, well, um, looks like John wanted to borrow his mom's umbrella, but his mom wouldn't let him, or his mom tried to give him an umbrella, but he didn't accept the umbrella. And then he walked to school and it was raining and he got really wet and he was upset and realized he should've listened to his mom. So the next day he brought an umbrella to school.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:57    Okay, great. All right. And now I'd like for you to take a look at this picture again. It tells a story.

So a family's cat got stuck up in a tree and the dad wanted to go up and try to get the cat, but he couldn't. So, uh, they ended up having to call the fire department to try to get the dad and the cat out of the tree.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:23    Okay, great. All right. So now are you familiar with the story of Cinderella? Yes. Okay. Um, yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna get you to take a look at this book. This'll just kind of help refresh your memory. Um, so take a look at the pictures in this book and when you're finished, I'm gonna take the book back. Um, and then I'm gonna have you tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    Okay? Okay. I think I got it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:48    All right.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:50    Cinderella was, um, <affirmative>  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:54    Was, I think adopted and brought a two family, and she had two stepsisters and a mom. She's really mistreated. She was basically treated like the house slave or whatever. She'd do everything for him. And then, um, so she developed relationships with like the animals and stuff around their property or whatever. And, um, then eventually she meets this fairy godmother that, um, grants her wish to go to this ball or, um, something of that sort. And she meets a prince who, uh, and has like a great night with him and everything and loses one of her slippers. And then at the end of the story, the prince comes back with the slippers and the two evil stepsisters are trying to pretend like, think, oh, my slipper might fit me. But then it ends up fitting Cinderella and, uh, basically your dreams come true.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:43    Okay. Great. All right, so we have one more thing.

It's not right. And so, um, uh, the doctor came in at that time and I said, he's afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity. So he goes out and gets the head nurse and she comes up, does a di di uh, another, um, um, she goes and cleanse it out again, which she said, I don't like doing this twice so soon, but I feel like I should. Well, the 11th day I was at work and they called me and they told me that, uh, uh, he told me that he was shaking the bed. He was jerking so well, he said, get him to the hospital. I called the doctor and he said, get him to the hospital and the bacteria, we run into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:50    And, and, and she smelled at the area. She said, it's back. So there he had, they had killed all of those blood cells in there. No hope so he had to wear a tubes that he'd be in there for years and, and it'd be there the rest of his life. And, and so this goes on for eight years that I had to, um, change those, uh, change the, the bandage and, and um, and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet. And it was very painful at first. I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time to get the, the, the, the catheter. And all changed 'cause it, it was a procedure that had to be done in the hospital. Well, my daughter was a nurse and she kept wanting me to go to the, to the VA because he was a veteran.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:39    And, and, and, uh, get the things over there. And they had a bacteria, a committee over there that might be able to help him. So we'd go over there and while we were in this office, there was this, um, um, cabinet there. They had tape silk tape in it, and it was wide. And so I asked the nurse, I said, where do you get that wide tape? I said to the, I can only find the nara and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged up. We were paying over 200 or close to $300 at that time, a a a month for his supplies. And she said, you didn't have anything you want. Well, the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was a procedure that he would, he knew I could do it, but he wouldn't give it to me 'cause it was a procedure done in the hospital. So when she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her what size of catheter I wanted, ster, eyes, pens, and the, and the solution to, to irrigate with and everything that he needed and, and the sterilized gloves and all. So I go home and the first time it needed to be irrigated.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    I do it myself. Well, I, after I got through, I sat there, couldn't get up because I thought if I, that pen that went down into his cavity, they'd have to do surgery to get, go in there to get it, get that tube, that tube  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Out. And, and, and so, uh, I was scared to death, but he said I did much better job than they did at the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through, through them to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity. And that way, uh, I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He weighed 200 and some pounds. And, and, and then he went down to 126 when he went left the hospital and he came back upward. Nobody knew that he was sick. And the doctor said that he couldn't have lived if it hadn't been for me. And, uh, uh, so, uh, he wanted to have the, the, the doctor said the only thing that they could do is go in there, clean that cafeteria out and, and put in, uh, marbles in there to make that, uh, build it up to where it, it would, he'd have more stability.

So at least a week, but it may have been more, but at least, you know, I did it until they saw this guy coming every day. You know, what's he doing? Oh, he's selling the ticket. No wonder we don't get such a long line, you know, he's taking the business.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:39    Okay. I have one more that's very similar. Again, if you'll look through these pictures and then tell me a story with the beginning, the middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:49    Okay. So this goes back to a time when my brother Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's house. Now, a little bit about our neighbor. He was a very, he was a bachelor, a gentleman. He was very nice, but he did not want us playing ball in our backyard, which was very, very close to his house. Uh, so what was supposed to happen, and I told Sam, you know, one day one of us is gonna kick the ball into, into our neighbor's window. His name was Mortimer, so we're gonna kick the ball into Mortimer's window. We're gonna be in trouble. He said, no, we shouldn't worry about that. Okay? I went with it until the day came when Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's more immersed window. So it went on into, into the house. Not only did it break the window, it also knocked over a lamb that Mr. Morder had told us was a very, very dear object in his house. It had a history of family inheritance and heirloom that I can't quite remember, but I do remember how much he appreciated the lamp. So we were both frozen when we saw Mortimer, uh, looked through the hole that Sam had just put in the window, and I can't tell you what the consequences were, but I do remember that we had a very, very hard time after that incident.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:28    Thank you very much. Excellent.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:31    I could have gone on for consequence,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:35    <laugh>,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:35    And then the suit with the higher court, and then we hired a different lawyer. And  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:42    <laugh> good restraint because I have so many other tasks for you, <laugh>. Okay. Um, here's a similar task. Please look through these pictures and then tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:56    Okay. I remember my Aunt Charlotte, my Aunt Charlotte was a very, very wicked person. I did not like her at all, and I remember staying in her house one day. For some reason, we weren't allowed to stay at home because the painters had just finished painting and they didn't want us to to sleep where, where there was paint, fresh paint, smell around. So I stayed at, on Charlotte's. Well, lo and behold, the next day it turned out that it was a rainy day. So I'm going to go to school, which was a much longer walk from on Charlotte's house than it was from my house, and it was raining. So I said, Hey, aunt Charlotte, can I please borrow your umbrella? And guess what she said? No. Which I knew she was gonna say no, because that's how wicked you was. So I went out in the rain and eventually realized that I was gonna get the flu.

Let's see. Um, oh gosh, I'm gonna just go with that and try, I don't know. I hate to pain you with such a, okay, here we go, <laugh>. Okay, so 10 years ago in July, I had a right rotator cuff repair surgery and um, he was gonna be a little bit more involved at that. There was a growth somewhere up there, so he couldn't do it endoscopically. So I knew it was gonna be open. Shoulder surgery went in and the, um, slight tear in the rotator cuff at that point from the time of the M R I to the surgery, uh, went from a slight tear to a full tear. Um, he also saw for the first time that my bicep was fully torn and that the nickel size growth apparently now is the size of golf ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    So he graft bone from, I dunno, collarbone area. And the bottom line is he was, you know, from this area, he was all the way down bicep area. And, um, that was, that it was supposed to be a day surgery. Um, later that evening, the nurse came in, monitored me, monitored me, and I had horrible pain all night. And then eventually around, I don't know, three or four in the morning, I really don't know what time she came in and she jammed my thigh with the thing of morphine and knocked me out. Finally, it was, she had done that at midnight and, um, I forgot a really important point. Earlier in the evening, the evening nurse had came in and rubbed my arm here, can you feel this? Can you feel this? Yes, yes, yes. And then when she got to like mid forearm, can you feel this all the way down in my hand?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:50    I said, no. And she goes, oh, no worries. Sometimes the block takes up to 24 hours to wear off. But I was kind of like, kind of, sort of freaked out about it. But anyway, but I didn't know any better. So into the bad night, morphine four, six in the, around three, four in the morning. And then the surgeon came in for his rounds early in the morning, like around six-ish. I heard you had horrible night. I said, yes, and I was supposed to be day surgeries. Well, you're gonna have to go home soon. It's only going to get worse. He said, so I'd be happy to give you another block, but I have to tell you, there's a 50 50 chance that they give you another block. You could lose feeling in your fingers forever. And I remember just being like, where's why? You know, I've never heard this before.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:31    Anyway, um, so I didn't want it, but I was in, I was already starting to be in a lot of pain and I only had had the morphine had only been, I don't know, no more than four hours old. So I was panicked. I said, let me think about it. He said, you think about it, but I'm gonna go around, do the rest of the floor, come back to you. You have to have your answer by the time I come back. So I said, all right. As soon as he left, I was like, I can't chance it. And I was afraid to fall asleep. Bruce was coming, he was dropping the kids off in high school  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    At that point. One of them was. Um, so he was there by 7 45 in the morning, told to the same story I just told you. And I said, I don't wanna risk having the second block. So he didn't. And there was a wonderful male nurse on that day for the morning shift, and he like medicated me as much as he could with the orders, the standing orders to make it to day surgery and get me through. Ended up being released around four that afternoon. And, um, anyway, it, there was, there was a lot of e e g and all sorts of tests. And second and third opinions, Boston and New York, they all said surge error. Meantime, I had done pt, I started ot, um, which I, which was a little bit dicey because when a surgeon gives you PT orders, they typically refer you to the PT place they own.

And I found the New York Stock Exchange, and I, you know, I was sort of like a pseudo tourist.

It's a fancy Hagen with a powder puff on top, but a car. Carl is wearing beads around his head between his eyes, and he also actually, he has one ear sticking out and he has the powder box lid on his head. They're very proud of themselves.

He's into the basement and there's our little boy safe and sound sitting on a soft pile of clothes waiting to be locked. Now we see the little boy on Carl's back. They're back upstairs and we go into the living room. Oh my goodness. He sits down and there are papers flying all over the place. He's gotten into the newspaper, not the little boy Carl.

So Carl is dancing in the middle of the rug in his hind legs and the little boy is just thrilled. He sees that he just giggles and laughs and he can't quite dance yet, but he really loves to watch the dog dance. Uh oh. We've gone to the kitchen.

And what we did was, it was remote diagnostics of routers, trouble, network trouble. And Jorge was great that he could talk to the Spanish speaking customers wonderfully, but when it would come over to an English speaking customer, he definitely had problem. He, he didn't have terrible problems, but it was hard trying to get him to recognize that he wasn't saying things right and was hard getting him to understand what I was saying sometimes. So we gotta, the point where I joked with him about some of the ways he would say things like he would have a piss of paper instead of a piece of paper.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:51    Um, and then, um, it was, it was just, Jorge, you sound like this.

So that felt good that I was able to help him and I was able to learn about his communications because he helped me. Yeah, I had high school Spanish, that's been a few years ago, but he helped me understand some phrases. And in fact, he actually helped my daughter with her. Uh, she went on a, a, what do you call it? It's not an immersion in Mexico. And when she came back, we had Jorge and his wife over for dinner, and they talked Spanish the whole time.

So, um, Cinderella, her father, uh, remarried a woman after her mother died. And this woman had two daughters. And so Cinderella came to live with, um, her father and her stepmother, and two stepsisters. And then her father passed away and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters. So, um, they were very mean to Cinderella, and she became like a housekeeper for them. She did everything in the house, and she cleaned and she cooked, and, and they treated, mistreated her. So one day there was a ball given by the king and queen, uh, to find a suitable wife for their son, the prince.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:00    Um, so the invitation came and the stepsisters were all excited, but poor Cinderella, she couldn't go. She didn't have the clothes. Her stepmother and stepsister said she wasn't invited to the king's ball. So she, um, she wished she could go to the ball, but, uh, she had no way to do that. And she was very sad. And so the night of the ball, the stepsisters get to go to the ball. They're all dressed up, they're very fancy and, and ready to go to the ball. And out the door they go, Cinderella's down in the basement, and she's crying. And all of a sudden, her fairy godmother appears, uh, and asks why she's crying. And she says she wished she could go to the ball. And so the fairy godmother said that she could. And she, uh, fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage, and the mice that were running around into, um, uh, carriage drivers, and, uh, they had, she had horses for the carriage.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:08    And she, uh, cast the spell. And Cinderella has a beautiful dress. And, um, she, her hair is beautiful. She has a beautiful dress. And she says, you will go to the ball. Go to the ball. But one, one rule is that at 12 o'clock midnight, you must be home by 12 o'clock because all of this magic is going to go away. So Ella goes off to the ball, she gets there, the prince becomes smitten with her. When he sees her, he's dancing with her. Her stepsisters are just seething because who is this? Who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with? They wanted to be chosen by the prince, and the night is going wonderfully.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:00    And then she hears the clock strike 12, and she remembers where her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken. And she runs out and down the stairs, leaving the prince behind. And as she's running down the stairs, one of her glass slippers comes off because when the fairy godmother, um, cast the spell, she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing. One of them gets left behind on the steps and she runs home and she, um, she gets home before, you know, as the spell is being broken. Well, the prince is very smitten with her, and he wonders who this beautiful woman was. And he wants to find throughout the kingdom where this woman, who this woman is. So he sets out, he finds the glass slipper on the steps, nose, it belongs to her, and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper. \n"}, {"job_id": "uPq1I6QrADtBIGc5", "filename": "richardson23_413000_651745.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    All right. So what happens is, uh, once upon a time we land far away, there was mean woman with her two daughters who were also very mean, and then there cousin, I don't remember how they related. Somehow Cinderella comes to live with them. And, uh, so she comes when she's really young, and then, uh, she's forced to do all the chores and while the other two sisters live in luxury. And, uh, Cinderella is really nice, uh, and makes the most of it and be friends, all of the animals. And, uh, then one day a letter or, uh, in the same city there's a prince or there's like a royal family. So the prince is of age where he needs to get married. And so the family's like, oh, we need to have a big ball, get all the pretty women to come out and dance with them.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:20    And then they'll find his match. And so they send the royal decree out to everyone, all them the suitable age also come to the ball. And so, uh, Cinderella and the two sisters are really excited. So Cinderella by herself makes her own really nice, uh, ball gown. And then as she's about to go, the other two sisters get really jealous and rip her gown to shreds. And, uh, then the stepmother doesn't let her go. And she's up in her room <laugh>. And, uh, she's really sad. You, she, what happens? Oh yeah, she runs out to the courtyard and she's crying on the steps. And then her fairy godmother appears out of nowhere. Like, where was she the previous, like 20 years. Uh, but uh, she's like, all right, I'm going to give you like a really nice gown. And when you turn all of your animal friends into like the horses that are carried, miscarriage, and, uh, and then she gets to go and while she's at the, uh, ball, she starts dancing with the prince and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    They're really into each other. And so she loses track of time and oh yeah, <laugh> the catch is the fairy godmother said that you can have all of this, you know, the nice ballgown and everything, but the match's gonna run out when the clock strikes 12 at midnight. So, uh, she's dancing with the prince. Everyone's like, oh, they're meant to be together. They would look out to get on. And so the start, the clock starts to strike 12, and she's panicking. And so she runs out. On the way down the stairs, she loses one of her glass slippers. Uh, another detail I forgot to mention, she has glass slippers. She loses one of those and then gets in, jumps into the carriage, and they race off. \n"}, {"job_id": "AdVC2hVmf05JsWEh", "filename": "wright39a_799135_1037864.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:03    There was a young woman and her father, and they lived in a town all along. Her mother had died, the father was lonely. And one day he met a another woman and decided to marry and make a new family. The woman had two daughters, and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created. Well, sadly, the father died leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two, her two half-sisters or two sisters. The stepmother was not happy about this, and she did not see Cinderella as her own. So she made her more of a house servant than a daughter, and she made her wait on the, her two daughters and clean house and take care of them. Ciri was not happy about this, but she felt like that was her destiny. So she cleaned and cooked and, and did everything that she was told to do. Cinder had a very sweet and gentle heart. She made friends with the animals. They were her only friends. She was so busy. She never had time to go out and do anything with other friends. Cinderella's, um, general Hart would carry her a long way. She, um, let's see. Um, let's back up a little bit. Um, I'm thinking about the pictures in the book.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:32    Um, on the other side of the, the town, there was a castle and the town was ruled by a king. The king. This king had a son, and the son was of age to be married. They needed, when they needed a new heir to the throne. Um, and if he wasn't married, he could not become king. So the, the father, the king, decided to throw a ball and fighting all eligible young women, so he would have a large, uh, uh, large number to pick from for his future bride. Uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:16    The invitations were delivered and certainly the stepsisters were invited. In fact, every young eligible woman was invited. Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation, but the stepmother was not about to let her go. So she, uh, was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives once in a lifetime opportunity, but she was unable to go. So off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball, and Cinderella stayed at home. Very sad, very lonely. When suddenly, uh, uh, some magical event appeared, uh, occurred, and the, uh, met her very godmother appeared and said, do not cry. You can go to the ball. And Cinderella was very concerned about her dress, and the stepmother instantly created a dress for her and, uh, turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice into horses. And Cinderella had, uh, was ready to go to the ball, but one warning she was giving was, um, if you don't return before midnight, everything, all the magic wears off, your dress will become racks again, and your, uh, carriage will become a pumpkin again. And she said, don't worry, stepmother, I or, uh, fairy godmother, I will. So she goes to the ball, has a wonderful time dancing with the prince, and he's entirely taken with her. No one knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way. The stepsisters didn't even recognize her.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:56    Well, it's getting close to midnight. \n"}, {"job_id": "1RurF8dOFGiKKaaJ", "filename": "richardson176_18275_256966.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay.

And, uh, they immediately take advantage of Cinderella. Uh, she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and, uh, has to attend to their needs and the needs of the household. And evidently, father was of no help in mediating, uh, any of this. So the girl ends up, uh, being in the household, but, but being rather a member of the household, being a, uh, a servant. As I said, one day, uh, a ball is announced. She lives in a, I guess a principality headed by, you know, royalty. And one day a ball is announced, if I recall correctly, it's because the prince, uh, is in need of finding a wife. His father tells him that it's time for him to marry.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    So a ball is, uh, organized and all of the eligible young ladies, uh, in the principality are invited to attend.

But it turns out that she's not gonna be allowed to go. Uh, she of course, is very sad about that. Enter her fairy godmother. Um, they go, they go up to the ball, the, the, the, the stepsisters and stepmother go up to the ball, fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says, the Cinderella, you're gonna go too. And we're gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen. Um, and I guess the mice too become horses. I'm not sure which animals become the horses, maybe the mice.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:08    Um, she's outfitted Cinderella's outfitted with a gown, uh, and a pair of go, uh, glass slippers, white glass, I don't know. Um, but she's told she has to get home by, by midnight, because at the stroke of 12, everything's gonna turn back to what it was. The coach will become the pumpkin, the coachman will become the mice. She'll lose her beautiful clothing. So she goes to the ball, promises to, to leave by 12. Uh, but she's having a great time. And the prince is very much drawn to her. And, uh, she's still dancing when the clock strikes 12, but gets out in time, um, and gets, gets back home, uh, in time. But  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    As she's running out, one of her slipper, uh, slippers comes off and the prince picks it up, and it turns out that, uh, uh, she's the one that he wants, and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady, uh, into this, into the glass slipper. So, uh, a hunt is organized, so to speak, where the prince goes around to each of the households and the principality, and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper. And the, the stepsisters, of course, try and they don't fit, and they try to push their feet into that slipper and it doesn't work. And they're very upset.

And, uh, he, um, Cinderella's mother passed away and he got remarried to a woman that had two daughters. And they were very horrible people just in general. Um, but they got married. And so they blended the families. But meanwhile, Cinderella's father passed away, and the minute that he passed away, the evil stepmother, um, started treating Cinderella very poorly. She would, um, basically give her daughters anything and everything that they wanted, so she spoiled them rotten, but made Cinderella basically be the, the servant for everyone. She would've to scrub the floors, do the cooking, uh, take care of the sisters. Um, but, uh, one of the dreams that Cinderella had was to meet, uh, or to go to the, to go and see the castle. Well, at the same time in the castle, the king, his, uh, really sort of frustrated because his son, the Prince, prince Charming, I think this one prince, but Prince Charming, has not selected, uh, a bride.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:00    So he, um, he's trying to think of a way to get his son to sort of urge him along to, to get married. So he decides to throw a huge ball and invite all of the maidens from the entire kingdom. So, of course, the invitations to go out to everyone, uh, Cinderella's stepmother receives one, and it's asking for all of the, uh, um, young women to come to the, to come to the ball. So, of course, the, the, um, evil stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited, and so they want to start getting prepared. Um, but the stepmother does not want Cinderella to go. So she says she can go, but only after she finishes all her chores. And so she does. But she overloads her with all of her chores, but she also has to help her stepsisters get ready. So basically she has no time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:47    However, Cinderella is friendly with all of the animals, the rats, the, the, uh, horses and just everything. She can actually sort of talk to the animals. And so she, um, while she is doing all of her chores, they're actually helping create her address. Um, it was one that she had, I guess that was her, was her mother's. So they fixed it up and make it look, you know, obviously modern for the time and, uh, fix it up. And as she finishes all of her chores, she gets in and very sad because she thinks that she's not gonna have time to get ready, but a last she is able to, to try to get ready to go, and she puts on the dress and steps out to catch the carriage to go with her stepsisters. But the, uh, the rats and the animals had actually used bits and pieces of her stepsisters, castoffs to make the dress. And when they saw that, they of course, uh, became jealous because they were spoiled rotten and not very nice. And so they started tearing her dress the various pieces off. And so they left her dress in tatters and left her in emotional tatters. And, um, so she runs back to her room and is crying. But at that moment in time, she meets her  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Fairy godmother, who, um, is well a fairy. And so she is able to, uh, bippity bop boo and make, um, uh, cast spells to, uh, make a dress, to make a carriage, to have, you know, just sort of a, a, a very royal type entrance. So she goes to the ball meets Prince Charming. They have a wonderful time, but the spell would only last until midnight. So as they're dancing the night away, she loses track of time and it's about 1158. So she starts to flee the ball and, uh, she has to get away before midnight or everything goes back to the way that it was. And she, as she's running away, she loses one of her glass slippers, which is one of the, um, actually the glass slippers and mistranslation. It was actually supposed to be a fine leather sandal, but that's something totally, totally separate. Um, loses one of her glass slippers, runs away.

And so she's just like, what's going on here? But she's really exhausted from running. So she, she crawls into one of the beds and like, crawls up and goes to sleep. Well, the house actually belonged to seven doors, and they were, they had been out working all day. And so they, they come back home and you can imagine they're surprised when they find a woman sleeping in their bed.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:56    They're like, what? What's going on here? And so, like, they all gather around and like, they're staring. They're like, what is, what is this? And she wakes up and she's like, startled. I mean, what do you expect when you got seven little creepy men staring at you? Uh, and so like, uh, they calm her down after the first shock of seeing all of 'em.

And well, one day she's out, um, in the woods looking for something. And uh, she  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Comes across this old lady and the old lady has a basket full of apples. And so the old lady offers her an apple, and she's like, oh yeah, sure, I'll take an apple. And she takes a bite. Well, the old lady was really the witch in disguise, and the apple was poisoned. And so snow white falls asleep and like the, the, um, the doors can't wake her up. And they, they start chasing the old lady and she's climbing up the mountain and she's holding onto a branch and she's climbing up and the lightning strikes and it breaks the branch, and she falls off the side of the mountain and dies. And then like, the doors are just so sad 'cause they, they can't wake snow light up.

The little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree, and little Sally was worried about the cat. So she went and found a ladder. She was gonna put the ladder up by the tree.

So, uh, my sister came into town to, uh, stay with me during that week while I was, uh, gonna be getting them out, and I had to go to Scottsdale. Uh, I think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done, but they did it like on a day surgery. Um, but what I remember about it most is a, it hurt, but my surgery was scheduled at like 1130 in the morning, but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there, I was like a little bit dehydrated, so they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me like six times in order to get the IV in.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:05    And that was very, very unpleasant, <laugh>. Um, they, they finally got it in, took me into, uh, the little hospital room, and I remember that they were playing, uh, pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, oh, that's gonna be great. You're gonna gimme drugs, and I'm listening to Pink Floyd, so this is gonna be a good day. Uh, so did that, um, laid down on the gurney. They gave me, uh, the iv and then the next thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery, uh, and my throat hurt. It was painful. I felt I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurt so bad. Um, they were trying to gimme like some water to help kind of soothe out my throat, and I couldn't swallow it, so it was coming back outta my nose.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:56    It was just, it was a mess. It was horrible. Um, but the whole thing probably took like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out. But it was like 12 hours of torture for that. Um, and that was the Friday before Christmas mm-hmm. That they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to, to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. Um, you know, people are like, oh, you always get ice cream. You get ice cream. But I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't have ice cream. So that made it that much worse. Um, I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt and it was burning my throat. Um, and it was probably, it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that. Um, and I've had people ask me, you know, if you had to do it all over again, I was, I'd have just, I'd just continue to have strep throat.

So, um, I once went to a train station to buy a ticket for my mother who was wanting to go back from, from town a to, to the capital, capital of the country in, in Argentina. And my mother wanted to travel the next day, so I went to buy a ticket for the next day and there was a long line of people waiting to buy tickets for the next day, but then at the other end of the hall, there was a line for people returning tickets. So I found that if you were returning a ticket for the next 24 hours, you got 60% knocked off the price. You only got 40% of your money back. So I found somebody who was going to return a ticket for the next day and I said, look, they're going to discount 60%. And I said, what? No, that's impossible. I said, well, you can check with information office. And so this person checked and yes, so. \n"}, {"job_id": "UUMHBeL6PO2M9ywX", "filename": "richardson204_116750_355389.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, there was also a dog that was barking.

Um, there was, she had always like dreamed about, you know, like looking out the castle window and dreamed about, you know, life elsewhere. And, um, there was announcement of a ball for the Prince to, um, be married. Um, so she had, she wanted to go to that. Um, however, she like had no way of getting there really. 'cause her stepsisters didn't want her get, want her to go. Um, she ended up recruiting, um, some friends like her mice and dog friends to make the dress for her. Um, and, and so she ended up getting the dress ready and everything to go to the ball. Ends up that the stepsisters found out they got mad, tore her dress apart, um, and she ended up crying and making, you know, upset. So her very grandmother came along, provided her with dress and flippers and a carriage, and told her she had to be, um, back by midnight or else she would lose all of her dress and all of that. Um, so she went to the ball, she met the prince, had a really great time, um, was sprinting out the door. We, by midnight lost her slipper. Um, and in the weeks proceeding that the prince had to go around and figure out who was this girl who missed, who missed her slipper 'cause he was in love with her.

Once upon a time, long, long ago, in the land of Make Believe, there was a man that lost his wife, but had a young daughter, a sweet young gal, sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:39    He decided it was time that he got, took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella. 'cause she needed a woman as she was growing up. She needed a mother. And so he married a widow, a lady who did not have a husband, but had two young daughters. This, the woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her. And she banished her to the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs, and her to her own. Two little girls were really nasty little brats, got to sit around, get lots of new clothes, and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked. But she had her little cat who she loved, and the cat kept her hump and helped as much as she could. And this went on. Daddy was completely unaware. \n"}, {"job_id": "A155gsHxXFozxLiF", "filename": "MSUC03a_674709_913342.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Life is learning from one's mistakes. <laugh>, <laugh>.

Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:48    So Cinderella is sent to live with this, uh, with a family. And she is basically a, uh, a maid. And, um, they, they're the two, um, stepsisters, the two, I think it's the wicked stepsisters, if I recall. And they were, they were rather homely, <laugh>. And, uh, Cinderella, of course, is very pretty and she's very, you know, sweet and helpful. And these two are kind of spoiled and, you know, not very pleasant. And there's gonna be a, a, a ball. And I, I believe invitations go out and the two sisters are going to, um, uh, they're gonna go to the ball and Cinderella is not invited. And somehow the theory godmother steps in and Cinderella ends up with, uh, well, it's all magical, you know, right. The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach. And by dent of, you know, luck in good favor from the, the fairy godmother, Cinderella does go to the ball. I believe the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight.

And then a, uh, man climbed up in the tree to try to get the cat and he can't get down and the firefighters are coming to come rescue the man because his ladder fell down and to rescue the cat.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:59    Okay.

Okay, because I'm, I hope the other person in the room isn't an audiologist, but it is what it is. Um, so he, he went for the e n t, sent him to the audiologist, and the audiologist was in this little glass room with, you know, stuffed animals that moved and symbols and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this, and she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass, because before she moved the drums, she, he was so smart, she looked at the drums and then she looked at him, and then she moved the drums. And then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey with the symbol, and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway, the e n t and I get into it in a big loud way because I, he, he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests. Anyway, we go through. So finally, finally, he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with this beach language pathologist. He was 2.8 I think at that time, that fall. I'll never forget the first session, Madison. I was like, this is never gonna work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early thirties. She looked like Cinderella, blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him to the verge of tears every sessions. We were private pay. She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate the session. And she worked wonders. And we ate, drank and slept letters and sounds that sheep in the Jeep Book, alphabet cereal, alphabet pasta.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:17    It was like crazy town. So we did that, um, with private pay with her, and then at three years old, the town would pick him up. So I thought, it's a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that S l P, um, just in case with funding. And, um, Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use, I can't, it would be not right for me to take your money anymore. He was, initially, when she met him, consultation, he was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder, which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she, you know, when she dismissed him, you're good. He's all good to go. I was real paranoid and she was,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The only thing is 50% of the children with this, um, diagnosis, the, the way they're taught, traditionally taught how to read in public schools, they're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that point, you know, have the, I don't know what, go to private school, get another re I didn't know what we were gonna do Madison, but I was like, rah. So anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP who had just graduated Madison. She was lovely, so sweet. He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on. Every time we went in there, she was so sweet. She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave, he would look at me and smile, oh my gosh, it was terrible. And then she went off to, I don't know where. And then he got a, an experienced older woman who again cracked the whip with him.

Carl puts his hands up on the window, sill, looks out, watches to make sure the mother is gone. The baby is now standing up in the bed looking very expectantly at the dog. The dog walks over to the crib. The baby steps out onto the dog's back, and they're off across the hallway to mother's bed where they have a wonderful time playing on the big bed in mother's bedroom. Then they move to the dresser where the baby puts powder on the dog's nose, has the jewelry out. The next picture has the jewelry and the top of the powder box draped on the dog's head.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And the baby has a handkerchief and a pin cushion on his head. There's breezes are blowing gently in the window curtains and the furniture in the room. The size of furniture is changed. The jewelry box is suddenly a whole lot larger. Hmm. Uh. Then the next scene, the baby is obviously in the hallway or in the bathroom, is sitting on the edge of the laundry chute. The basket of clothes is beside the laundry. Chute the dog after seeing the baby. Sitting on the edge of the laundry chute runs way down the stairs down into the top of the basement stairs. Look at the baby who's sitting happily on top of the dirty laundry. After having fallen all the way down the laundry chute goes down into the basement, the baby gets back on his back and they go back upstairs and he starts across the floor running pill mill, sliding on a rug, which then upsets, uh, table in the living room.

When, um, I was pregnant with my first child, and I read this book by Jenny McCarthy about when she was pregnant with her child, and she ate all these brownies. And I thought, wow, look at her. She looks great. I'm gonna eat lots of brownies too. That was a big mistake because I ate, I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time. And, and then my, uh, uh, blood pressure went really high and, uh, like towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up with, um, toxemia. And so I, they realized it when I had woken up one morning with like a, it was probably beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything. My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill him and <laugh>, and I just, my, it was like a pulsating thing in my head.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:17    And I went in and I had to the, to the clinic, which was close to my house. And I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like, by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often, and it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken, then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and, and talk really fast and write everything down that he says. And then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day I came in, went to pee in the cup, and then went to go, uh, to take my blood pressure and I'd have to sit at this machine and it takes your blood pressure and prints it out, and then you go hand it to a nurse.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    So I did, I went, put it in there, printed out, I handed it to the nurse and she was just like, Hmm, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay. So I <laugh> do it again, and it prints it out and it's just as high. So they're like so irritated with me by this point, like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse who's the professional right, does it and realizes, holy crap, this woman's got like <laugh> really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away. And they said, we're checking you in right now. And so, because this is very serious, and they checked and they had like, I don't know, what is it, like  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Sugar or something in my urine and my, yeah. So there's all kinds of problems happening with me, unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and, uh, put me on a really strict diet. And, uh, after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down, but then, um, they said, well, it's, you're, we could send you home, but, but we're not a hundred percent sure that you could control this, so we think we should induce you. 'cause it was, I was far enough along and so it was a Tuesday morning and they said, at five 30 in the morning, we're gonna bring you down to induce you. And they, oh, this is kind of gross. But they made me take a suppository <laugh>, which just really, whew, everything's clean.

Unfortunately, he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom, and she had two spoiled rotten little girls. And then unfortunately, he also passed away. So the, the mom and the stepsisters and the little Cinderella do all the work, all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the sewing. And she didn't have anyone to talk to. So she made friends with the animals. She'd go out and feed them and they'd talk together and, uh, just, they were her companions. One day the, the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife. So he sent out an invitation to all the eligible, uh, young women in the land. And, um, the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:03    And her daughters were so happy and they, uh, said, you know, okay, sure Cinderella can go, but you don't have anything to wear. So the little animals made her dress, they made it look beautiful. They sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball. So, uh, when it was time to leave, she came down and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be, and they said, oh, Cinderella, that's my scarf and my, my necklace. And they ripped the things off 'cause they said she stole it from them, even though they'd thrown the, the stuff away earlier.

She reads in the book about how, oh, yes, it looks like the prince is looking for someone to marry, and they're going to have all of these young women come to the, uh, castle or, and for a ball. So Cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the animals, no, no, that one was made by herself. And then, uh, she goes and gets ready to go, and then the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are ready to go. But then they say, oh, no, you're not going to go. And they rip all of her clothes off. And then she's crying and very upset and goes upstairs and is in her room. And then the, uh, I think this part is a little bit hazy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    Um, and maybe she goes out to a garden, actually. And that's when she meets her fairy godmother. And it seems like she sings a song with Bty bty Boo. Is that it? Or maybe another fairytale. Anyway, so she, she waves her wand and then her, her dog becomes a, does her dog become a horse or one of the carriage men? And then the mice, the mice turn into something, and then there, there the pumpkin becomes her carriage. And then the rule was that after, at midnight, you must be out of there because the magic will wear off. And  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    She also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown and glass slippers. And then she goes off to the, to the castle or the palace. And of course, the prince immediately falls in love with her and wants to dance with her all night long. And the stepsisters and the stepmother do not even recognize her, or everyone is watching and saying, who is that beautiful young woman? We don't know who she is. And then, um, this clock starts to strike midnight. And they, so she has to run out, and she leaves the prince alone. And the, the one of the prince's helpers goes chasing after her, and she's running down the stairs very quickly, loses one of her glass slippers, and then goes charging away to get back to the house. And then the, uh, magic wears off and she suddenly is just Cinderella once. \n"}, {"job_id": "O1ZKdxSQjpEpAKGm", "filename": "wright01a_686500_925038.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Oh, Carl's got grapes in his hand and the baby is grabbing for him.

Carl's back and they're going up the stairs. Carl is turning on the water to the tub, lifting up the baby by his shirt and putting the baby in the tub. Closing off. Now he's got soap in his mouth and a washcloth. The dog Carl. Carl's now blowing bubbles from soap. Now he's got the washcloth and he is trying to wash off baby <laugh>. I'm sorry. That's cute. Anyway, so baby's standing there with his clothes on still and Carl's got the blow dryer blown on him to dry him off. Now Carl's dumped the baby back in the crib and now Carl's cleaning up everything. He's putting everything in the trash and licking off anything on the floor. Now Carl's up looking out the window. He's made the bed. Carl the dog has made the bed that they were messing with and putting the uh, powder puck back up there. Obviously putting the dresser. Ah, he's looking out the window and there's the mom coming through the gate. There's another dog down there. So anyway, there's peacefully underneath the blanket. Looks like he's got a bottle of the baby in the crib and Carl's just sitting there right next to it, like they haven't gotten into anything. And there's Carl just looking like I've been so good.

They're got a diving, not a diving board, but a little walk out area to the water. Everybody's plan now, they're getting ready to have a picnic.

You take out the jelly, take the knife, spread the jelly out the other piece of bread, put the pieces of bread together, cut the sandwiches in half. You had flu symptoms. I started throwing up. I got on a plane, flew across country, thought I was better, got more sick, strep throat, feeling fever, chills. Went on for days, started to get better again. Developed a cough. Went to the doctor. He said it was a respiratory infection. After the flu, I have an uncle who's from rural Appalachia and he has no teeth and he has a thick, thick accent. And she was chewing tobacco. And when he speaks, it sounds like a long slur of almost vows. When he mumbles, it's almost impossible to discern what he's saying. Okay, what did you do about it? You just have to listen really intently. I'm kind of used to the accent. Um, if you're not used to the accent, you're not familiar with it. Between the lack of teeth, the chewing tobacco in his mouth in the accident, you'll never figure out what he's saying.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:13    So I was river rafting in West Virginia and there's this part where you get outta the raft and jump into a hydro, which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom. If you jump into the whirlpool, even with a light jacket on, it'll suck you to the bottom of the river. Normally it spits you up five to 10 feet after it sucks you down. If you hit it just perfectly, you can ride the hydro, the entire length of the hydro, and it takes you up about 50 feet. It's about the fifth person to do it. The first four people jumped in and popped up 10 feet later. I jumped in, hit it perfect, and it carried me down at the bottom, dragged me along, started to pop me up about 10 feet, sucked me back down and I sucked in a big gulp of waters. I came to the surface, thought I was coming back down. I was about a foot from the surface. I could see the light, and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another 40 feet. I thought I was gonna drown. I had a light jacket on. It's something. We took the bottom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:57    So there was a girl who got caught in a river, um, doesn't look like a flood.

And he is wearing a life jacket and he's trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl. The kid was going to school. His mother told him to take an umbrella. He insisted he didn't wanna bring the umbrella. He didn't need it. He went to school. It started raining. He got upset and came home, was soaking wet. His mother was upset that she didn't even listen to her. He changed the dry clothes, took the umbrella and left. The kid was playing soccer. He kicked his soccer ball through the window. It hit a lamp, broke the lamp. The guy inside the house jumped up, grabbed soccer ball and looked out to see who kicked it. Anything else?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:53    No. There was a man who had a daughter named Cinderella. He was a widower. He married a new evil cruel woman who had two daughters of her own.

Um, one day, uh, the king was yelling at his son about how he needed to get married. So he was gonna throw a ball and order all the single women in the kingdom to come. Cinderella and her sisters got the invitation. Cinderella was not allowed to go. Her sisters went. She was forced to stay home. The mice and the birds dough felt sorry for her 'cause they liked her. So they came and made her a dress and all the accessories so she could go. The sisters came home and found out about this and destroyed it. She was very sad. Then they left to go to the ball.

And of course, the prince sees that there's this beautiful and virtuous woman who he's never met before, and he wants to know who she is. And, um, they dance and they, they have a wonderful time. But pretty soon the clock shows it's almost midnight. And according to the, uh, legal stipulations of her contract with the fairy godmother, she must be home before 12 or else.

I believe I've kind of lost it there, but she gets home and on the way home, she lost one of her beautiful slippers. And she doesn't realize it at the time, but that's actually a good thing to lose a slipper because when the following days, the prince who's very upset because this woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball, he would like to see her again.

And, um, so she wanted me to see her house and her friends were all gonna be there. So I went over and, um, had a good time. I was tired, had one glass of wine I can remember, had one glass of wine. I had some tamales. I had beans and rice and a salad. And after that I just started real, really getting sleepy and tired. So I said I had to get going home. So I went home, I rolled the window down.

It's a long street that goes north up to Mount Bali. Well, I just lived in the, in the foothills of Mount Bali. So, uh, all these trees and everything that, uh, I was passing by, it was, it was in the evening, real late in the evening, maybe like one o'clock in the morning. And all I can remember was waking up and the police officer was asking me questions. And it was thing, I remember it was blurry. And, and then I, I don't remember anything else after that. Then I woke up again and I was in the hospital and I woke up and there was patches all over my face. I couldn't barely see outta only one eye 'cause it was my other face was, was covered. What happened is I ran into a telephone post and I, um, I had cuts.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:08    I still have a scar here. I pushed, I had my fingers, my thumbs. I was holding the steering wheel like this. And when I hit the telephone post, I bent the, um, steering column upward, and I, I remember breaking through the glass with my hands. And, uh, luckily I didn't break my thumbs. I had, I guess it got hit mostly on this arm. It pushed in this area.

He doesn't have a newspaper, but it knocks over a lamp, which is, you know, further damage that this little punk is gonna have to pay for. And the man picks up, the ball, goes to the window and looks out. But the kid has already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:37    Alright, thank you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:40    You're welcome.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:44    Okay, so here is another set of sequences and again, I just, um, you can take a look at the pictures, take your time and then tell me a story with the beginning. A middle end and end  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    Small child has a history of violent behavior and so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checked weather.com this morning and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain. So he's probably okay. And so the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds onto the umbrella and lo and behold, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain. And he's dismayed because not only was he right, he also now doesn't have an umbrella. And so he runs back home and he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he is not allowed to say, I told you so. And his mother relents and gives him a, him an umbrella with which to walk to school, but he's already wet. So it's kind of, you know, immaterial at this point. We a small child, you should not hit people with things. This wouldn't happen.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:48    Alright. And um, this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. Um, so I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and um, tell me a story again with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:05    Alright. It was a nice morning and this bird was in the tree singing, at which point the cat thought to itself and the cat, I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential. And so the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there. And that branch is kind of narrow and the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he can't get down. So he may as well look like he did it on purpose, at which point the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself that cat needs rescuing because I'm nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat, but the cat is too scared to come down and it's certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms 'cause it's a cat and they're ornery.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:59    And so the girl goes and gets her dad, and the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there and he's not really about that. So he goes to climb back down the ladder. When the dog notices the cat, it's just a stray dog. It lives by the school that, you know, goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet it. It's a nice dog, but it sees the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident. And so the man is stuck in the tree even though he could jump, that's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking, barking up to the right tree. And so he pulls his cell phone out of his pockets, probably a flip phone, it'd a Nokia, like something really sturdy.

Um, the little boy's, uh, the woman's son, um, is refusing an umbrella as mother is saying he may need for today. He's like, I'll be fine without it.

It looks like, uh, the little girl's cat got out the tree and her father or older brother or somebody kind up the tree tried to rescue the cat, and then he, unfortunately, also became stuck, and so they had to call the fire department out there to rescue both the cat and the father from the tree.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:23    All right.

She's brought to her aunt's house or something like that to live, and she's made to be used as a maid, which she waits on her, uh, two cousins and her aunt, and takes care of the animals and all that. And it appears that the, her two cousins are invited to a party, a ball of some sort, I guess, and they're like excited about going to the ball.

Um, in, let's see, in the late nineties, uh, my husband and I were living in Vermont. Our kids were finished with high school, um, uh, and, and moving on to make plans for themselves. And my husband was working for an international company that was, that had its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. And they were looking to expand the, their work in John's particular area of expertise, um, in as far as marketing goes in Europe. And so they asked him and another guy who had a similar job to his, in the company to interview, um, to, to have a job over there. So turned out that they preferred John of the two. And, uh, so they asked him to move over to Switzerland. We were kind of, obviously, but we knew that we were gonna have to leave our beautiful place in Vermont. I mean, Vermont.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:17    We lived there for 20 years and we loved it very much, but we knew we were gonna have to leave eventually because this job was just gonna take him somewhere else. So we thought, well, why not go to Europe? And so we decided to, he went over a year before I did, um, and lived, found us a place and did all the, you know, stuff that you have to do to get used to living in another country all by himself, which, you know, bravo him. Um, and then I went over and joined him after our daughter got married in June of nine, nine. Um, and, uh, so we, we lived in, we lived in a little village outside of Zurich, and it was an adorable little village we lived. The funny thing was we lived in a very, very modern little apartment complex, maybe, oh, I don't know, 20 or 25 apartments in it, two levels, maybe not even that many.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:17    But anyway, just, and everything else in the village was lovely and charming and old <laugh>. And, um, we did a lot of, uh, not, you know, now that I think about it, when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of traveling in Switzerland and, uh, and walking around our village because Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl. So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms, and then they have pa walking paths everywhere because the Swiss loved to walk. And so we could walk like to the next village or through, and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Basically go by the, um, uh, fields or we could walk through the woods. Uh, and they had passed going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company meanwhile bought a French scale company.

And we had what we call the stove wood box. We had a big box that our stove wood that we burned in, this cook stove was placed in. And I can remember mother sitting on this box of wood and telling me that I was not their daughter. And I knew my actual father and all my brothers and sisters, but I thought he was my uncle. And I thought they were my cousins. And I knew their mother was dead, but I didn't know she was my mother. She had died when I was two weeks old, uh, from childbirth.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    And, uh, I was the baby of eight children. And, um, the man and woman that took me, she was my birth father's sister and her husband. But first another family had taken me because I weighed like less than three pounds and they just kind of put me off in a room. 'cause my mother was really bad sick. And they, they didn't think I was gonna live. So another family had said they would take me. One of her brother's, one of my birth mother's brother and his wife. And I remember mother telling me that when she and daddy went up to check on Selma, which was my mother's name, that, uh, they asked about the baby and they said, oh, she's in the other room. She'll never make it. She's a little bitty thing. And, um, so they, they saw about me while I was there and they told them and said, you know, she, she needs a doctor.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:12    And they had to go ahead and leave. And about a week later, the, uh, my mother was still real sick, but my uncle, which would've been my uncle, he and his wife had taken me on to their home. And about a week after that, my actual, my mother died, and the lady and her husband that actually ended up raising me, the other uncle had called them and said, we can't take care of this child. She needs medical help. We don't have the money. We have a baby. Would you all come and get her? So they came and got me. And fortunately they lived next door to a doctor and mother. Mother and daddy were, they weren't  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Rich, but they were well off in, in many ways, not just monetarily. And, um, the doctor lived next door to 'em and mother had help in the house. She and Eva McDaniel carried me on a pillow for six months until I actually was beginning to weigh about five or six pounds. And this doctor that lived next door, Dr. Price mother, said that he, you know, took very good care of me. I, I was born without a lining in my stomach. Uh, I had, uh, I had some bones back here in the back of my neck that weren't very well developed. And um, so I grew up in this fairly fashionable lifestyle.

Mom and dad sit and watch the family play, enjoying their picnic. Poor little Susie Mouse is still sitting by the road wondering when her family will realize she's missing and come back for her.

Cinderella's father married the woman and her two daughters shortly after they were married, and the family was one. The father passed away after he passed away. Cinderella got to know her family in a different way. Stepmother was selfish, unruly, angry, and this lack of compassion, this lack of caring let her daughters to be even worse because they got no attention, no love, no care for their mothers.

This evening. This and all of the maidens of the land were invited. So the two stepsisters got so excited, slammed the door shut. They ran up to their rooms and they began getting ready. Cinderella became so excited, a chance to leave the house, chance to meet new people, chance to start over and start fresh to be seen. So she became getting ready when she was immediately disrupted by her sisters, demanding her help with helping them get ready, getting their dresses together, cooking and cleaning, and taking out all of their extra, their extra anger out from Cinderella. So she worked tirelessly all day, helping the sisters, taking care of the sisters, taking care of the mother. Finally, right before the ball, Cinderella stole away. She ran up to her room and to help of her friends and the creatures that lived alongside of her and had compassion for Cinderella's story. She made a beautiful dress and she did her hair up beautifully and with the resources that she had. She looked absolutely stunning. She went downstairs to meet her sisters and joined them for the ball, and they gasped at what they saw. She looked stunning, and that made them even angrier.

She saw a white light appear, and that white light began to grow and grow and grow until it took the shape of a beautiful, pleasant grandmother looking woman. She helped Cinderella up her feet, wiped the tears from her face, and asked her, do you wanna go to the ball? Do you wanna go to the ball this evening?

Um, and treated her daughters like princesses because that's what she wanted them to become. Um, Cinderella was a little more pretty on the inside and the outside than the stepsisters.

So then the stepsisters left, the went was crying and her fairy godmother showed up and helped her create a new dress, and a pumpkin turned into a coach to take her to the ball.

So they did a search, they went to all the houses and tried it on all the girls, and they tried it on the two stepsisters. It didn't fit them. And then they said, well, that was the last house. And then the one person, then the prince, saw Cinderella standing behind in the background that we hadn't tried it on her. The stepmother said, oh, it won't fit her. She wasn't at the ball.

So Cinderella is now left in the home with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who really were never so great to her anyway. But now that her dad is gone, she is treated very terribly and she's no longer really a family member. She's treated like, um, the maid, the slave, and they call her Cinderella 'cause they make her, you know, do clean out the chimney.

Plus, I think the stepsisters really could always tell she was much more beautiful than they were, and they didn't want the competition at the ball. So the night of the ball comes and, um, they lock her in somewhere. I think the old story was they locked her in somewhere and off they went. And she is crying or sitting there so sad.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:50    And what a horrible life. And her father, and she had such a great life and she's been terrible since he died.

And the little mice, or you know, Bitly Bach boomed and they're turned into horsemen and she's just about to leave. And she says, have a wonderful time. You look beautiful. However, all this magic and the spells will expire at midnight. You must get home by midnight. Cinderella says, certainly off they all go, and this beautiful chariot to the ball.

And as she's rushing out of the ball and down the palace steps, she loses a slipper. She gets in, just barely gets into that chariot and out of the sight of the palace, poof, back into a pumpkin. She walks the rest of the way home with the mice and she gets home in time before the stepsisters who's then arrive home and they share with their mom and Cinderella.

Well, when we went home on Christmas Eve, he was bacteria free, but they taught me how to irrigate it. And there was a container sitting there and I said, I've never done this before. Never watched them do it. So she said, I'm gonna show you how. She said, I've never done it before either. I said, if you haven't done it before, do you know what to do? And she said, oh, I know what to do. So she showed me how to irrigate it and how to take care of it. And so when, um, we got through, there was another container sitting there, I said, now what's this. \n"}, {"job_id": "oOTLSZ8Q8m0Nn98N", "filename": "MSUC03b_1508573_1746891.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me, Cinderella ends up as a, uh, being a maid working for this family. And it was a mother and her two, uh, daughters. They were just very shrill and very unattractive young women. Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet, and, and just, just very nice. These two were were very spoiled and, and didn't have any appreciation for anything. I mean, Cinderella was so nice. Even the barnyard, you know, animals loved her. The horse, whoever was out there, mice, even <laugh>, you know, <laugh>, she was a delight. Anyway, um, there's a, a, an, an announcement comes to the, uh, unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their, their McMansion, I guess, where they lived. They weren't in the castle. Uh, they got an invitation to, to a ball. The prince was gonna give a ball, and Cinderella used to, she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    And so when news came of this ball, uh, she was also silently very excited about it. But the two girls, you know, of course they were going, they had an invitation, uh, and somehow, I forget some of the details in between, but there was a fairy godmother who ends up, you know, helping working some magic. And Cinderella does go to the ball, uh, like a pumpkin, what was, it? Gets turned into a, a carriage and with horses. And she's got a beautiful gown on, and she just looks really just beautiful. And she, uh, the prince of course, you know, um, sees her right away and, uh, you know, one of those across a crowded room. And they danced all night and it was very romantic. And you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters that were, that were was that the stepsisters or was that another story?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    <laugh>, the wicked stepsisters. I don't know. Anyhow, um, those horrible faces like <laugh>. So anyway, the, the one caveat was that Cinderella had to be home by midnight. And you see in the, the clock is striking 12, and she's saying goodbye to the prince. Of course, he doesn't want her to let her leave. And she's late. She's running down this, you know, a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe. One of her glass slippers. And, uh, the, uh, Butler or whoever, major Domo from the, the palace was sent around, you know, to the town to find who fits into the shoe. And, uh, Cinderella gets locked up. You know, the mother, the horrible mother, thought that, you know, they'd crammed the shoe on one of her daughter's feet. <laugh>. And I remember their feet were ugly too, <laugh>. And, uh, the mice ends up getting, oh, she was locked in this room. You know, they didn't want her on the scene. And, um, the mice brought her the key. She got out and, um, tried on the shoe. Of course it fit perfectly. She married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after one hopes.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:17    Okay,  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:18    Great. And I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at that wedding, those, those horrible people. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:26    Alright, so let's move on to something a little bit different. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:33    Okay, now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here. Otherwise it's an open face. They don't call it a sandwich, right? <laugh>. So, be nice. We'll, we'll pretend we have two pieces of bread and, uh, I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread. Then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread. \n"}, {"job_id": "G7SmS0UbqIxC0oUa", "filename": "wright67a_391818_630121.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    No, it's, it's, you know, kind of brought the whole family together. I mean, there's funny stories about it. I mean, she decided not to eat and you know, like one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge, massive breakfast. 'cause she used to love to eat. And you know, we had to tell her, Nope, gene decide. She's not to eating today. So, I mean, it was all kinds of stories about it. But that's, well, there was this little girl named Cinderella who was like, really cute little girl. And, but unfortunately her mother or something nasty happened to her. I think she went to the, uh, the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years. And so Cinderella had to go move in with her, uh, evil stepmother. And, um, and her evil stepmother had two, uh, other daughters and evil stepmother really liked the other daughters, but didn't like Cinderella.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:47    So Cinderella and, um, you know, they're just, this, this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house. She's gotta clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff. So anyways, you know, the mom and the step girls, they're kind of reading the mail and they get an invitation to the ball where the prince is gonna be there. Like the prince is like this totally hot dude where Cinderella just has totally got the hots for this guy. It's like, he is like on television all the time and she knows what he looks like and is like, really wants to dance with him and stuff. But the evil stepmother says, no, you're not getting a dress. You know, it's like, you know, you're a cleaning girl and you stay home and, you know, clean the attic and stuff.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:32    Well, me and your stepsisters were gonna go to the ball. So she go shopping and they get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelry and new shoes and everything, and they go out, get ready to go to the ball. Meanwhile, poor Cinderella, she's up in the attic and she's crying while they're all going away. And, um, she's kind of just wishing wish I could go to the mall or to the ball. And all of a sudden, um, her fairy godmother appears and, uh, Bru Hill to the fairy godmother says, what's, what's the deal? Uh, Cinderella, what are you so upset about? And Cinderella says, I wish I could go with the ball. 'cause I really like this prince guy and I like to dance and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff, but that evil stepmother of mine won't let me go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:20    So anyways, there's the, the, the, uh, fairy godmother, you know, gets out the wand and touches Cinderella and all of a sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty go ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking. And then they go out in the garden and they dig up a pumpkin and she kind of does the pumpkin and turns the pumpkin into a carriage. And then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horse that pulls the ball carriage. And, 'cause you have to pull up the castle on a carriage, they won't let you into the ball. So anyways, they get into the, she gets into the pumpkin and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    The fairy godmother even put some like, uh, air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin. And they went to the ball and they got to the castle and they were able to sneak in. And, you know, she's kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies and, you know, the fairy god or the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters, they're kind of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her. And even when they see her, they don't even think it's her 'cause she's so pretty. Anyways, the prince comes in and, you know, they have the dance and they're all dancing around. And he, uh, sees Cinderella kind of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says, I don't know who you are, who are you? And she says, well, I'm Cinderella. And he says, well, would you like to dance? And she says, well, I don't, I'm not sure. I'm not sure I know how to dance, but I'd love to try. But she doesn't really know that the stepmother, they're the, um, fairy godmother, put a spell on the shoes so anyone in the shoes can like dance like magic, like, and on top of that, the shoes will only fit Cinderellas. \n"}, {"job_id": "vJhqNOa1xXLz5jOH", "filename": "capilouto55a_1439478_1677736.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    In 1993, they wrote this v version of Cinderella, and the pictures are quite colorful and very attractive. And regardless of whether you like mice or not, it's an appealing kind of conglomeration. Um, the classic is that Cinderella is stepchild. And back in the time that this story originated, uh, it was not a good position to be in because, uh, adults didn't have good attitudes toward stepchildren and, uh, people who might interfere with the, uh, flow of money in and out of the family. So that was to be a dance at the castle where the prince was, and the two sisters older than Cinderella. Um, and their mother received an invitation to the dance and were quite put up with themselves Will. With Will. Yeah. So anyway, they, uh, they're looking over their wardrobes, trying to find out what they should wear, and Cinderella doesn't have much in the way of clothing. It's pretty sad. So she's, uh, decorated with ashes and such from working in the kitchen, because in the kitchen in those days, you, uh, you used ashes or scouring powder and it clung to you, it didn't come off your hands. Right? Well, anyway, uh, they all were interested in the they, uh, dance and so that the, the two stepsisters were, um, so enchanted with their possibility of cornering the prince, that they continued to snipe it at Cinderella. But, uh, uh, they were so busy choosing what they were going to wear and that  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    She, she only had to do twice as much as usual in order to help them get ready for the, the dance. So sisters were dressed all up and mama acquired a coach from somebody to take the girls, and she led the way out. And they were really overdressed just, it was pretty sad, but you couldn't tell 'em that they didn't look as great as they felt They did, but they didn't.

The thing that I felt the most was extreme weakness. It just kind of knocked me down, sapped all my strength. And, uh, it took a long time for me to recover. Back in those days, they kept us in hospitals forever, and I was there 15 days. On the 10th day I actually hemorrhaged. And, um, but other than that, I can't remember too awful much about it. Like I said, I didn't have terrible pain, some discomfort at first, and, uh, then it was just a matter of lying there in the bed recuperating.

Uh, but, uh, he can do a little better if I ask him to try a little harder than he. It's better. It's more distinct. One thing that I recall, I was extremely frightened when, uh, my, um, 13 year old son ran a huge hook into his hand and had to be rushed into emergency. And, um, then, um, it was so painful for him to have this big hook.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    I took him to the hospital with a hook in his hand because, uh, we were afraid to pull it out. We might do, uh, further damage. And so he was, uh, uh, sent to the hand group at Jewish Hospital, and, uh, they had to open his hand and remove it because this hook had left a rusty path. But it was very fortunate that, uh, it sort of pushed everything out of the way as it entered his hand, because otherwise they were afraid that he was going to have bone and, uh, tendon damage. But, um, he healed fine. And, um, there were no, um, bad, uh, side effects from it. Wow.

So she hung it on her closet and she added a sash. And the birds helped her, and the mice helped her, and she made a beautiful dress. And when it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs. And the evil stepsisters didn't want her to go to the ball because she was so beautiful, and they wanted to marry the prince, one of them. So they went after her.

So Giselle, who is Cinderella in the story, she chose her best to make friends and to do everything that her stepmother and her two sisters demand of her when she always dreams for a better time and a better life. She's very kind, does her work and is subordinate and kind not work.

On 11th, I was photographing a mobile crane that was picking up a piece of electrical equipment from, um, concrete slab where high voltage, uh, power supplies are that power the neutron accelerator. And I wasn't being careful 'cause I was looking through the camera and I took one too many steps to the left from about four feet off the ground and was above an area that was gravel. And the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact embedded in concrete. So as I took one step too many and tumbled off the left side, just instinctively put up my elbow to stop myself. And, uh, the elbow hit and I was lying there for a bit, a bit winded. And electricians came over and, uh, checked on me and I said, oh, I'm fine.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:16    You know, I'll, I'll get up, I'll be up in a minute. But then I realized I really couldn't stand up because my leg hurt and the left arm elbow was swollen up and a very, very swollen, and I couldn't not move my lower arm at all. So they asked if they should, uh, call an ambulance and I said, oh, that's really not necessary, and I'll probably be okay in a bed. But, uh, the longer I was there, the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg, which turned out to be a very minor problem. But the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I was lying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the forties that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting shivers. And, and they did in fact call an ambulance who came. And when they came over to check on how to get me out of there, 'cause it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up. And it wasn't really obvious they couldn't just pick me up and get me out of there. But, uh, first they wanted to check to see if I had had head injuries. So they asked me some questions and one of the questions was where I was. So I told them I was at the, uh, cyclotron building, Tron doting. But by that point it was known as  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The, uh, ASAT Hall, which was the, uh, <laugh>, the Science and Accelerator Technology Hall, but it had also changed its name to the Mess Hall, which was the, uh, multidisciplinary science and accelerator technology hall and no science hall. And of course, they didn't know any of that <laugh>. But the worst, the worst question was that I was hoping they weren't gonna ask me who the president was.

Carl was a big Rottweiler and he was when, when mother went out shopping, she said to Carl, look after the baby Carl. I'll be back shortly. Carl was being left to babysit for a baby, and he was just a big, happy dog. They waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away. Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone. The baby also waited expectantly. When Carl was sure it was safe, he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out of the crib and onto Carl's back. Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse. They were going to have such a good time together. They walked down the hall into mother's bedroom. It looked so soft. They jumped up onto the bed and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch. Afterwards, they got off the bed and they went over to Mom's Vanity. There the baby got into mom's powder, perfumed powder, and he dusted Carl's nose. It tickled Carl's nose, but he liked the smell of the powder and he was having so much fun with baby. They played dress up.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can on top of him, just like a little Purple hat baby had a hat too. Baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff, they looked at themselves to in the mirror and they smiled. This was so much fun. Next, Carl took the baby to the laundry shoot. Uhoh, what do you think is going to happen here? The baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down, and at the same time, Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby. He gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry. Carl jumps down the stairs, gets the baby on his back again, and climbs back up, or runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck. Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room, scattering a newspaper every which way. They walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:55    The baby decided that he wanted to go swimming. \n"}, {"job_id": "75R88HySUAdNtnBg", "filename": "richardson20_374408_612541.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So, uh, Cinderella and her dad were living alone after her mom passed away, and her dad met a new lady who had two daughters, and they got married.

Um, they were always making Cinderella, do all the chores and do all the cooking, cleaning and everything else. And Cinderella found friends among the animals that the family owned except for the cat. The cat was also pretty, pretty evil. Um, and she became great friends with the mice, especially the mice.

They tore her dress, tore her necklace, and, uh, they told her that she had to stay home. And so Cinderella went out into the backyard and she was sitting there crying, and the mice and everything were trying to tear her up that they, they, they couldn't do it. And her fairy godmother appeared and her fairy godmother, like gave her, uh, like, asked her what was wrong, and she told her what happened.

She said, you have to be home by midnight because everything goes back to normal. And so Cinderella went to the ball and uh, when she got there, the prince saw her and he was just like, wow. And so they spent the whole night dancing together and just having a wonderful time. And then the prince was trying to get to know her a little bit better, and then the, she looked up and saw the clock and it was about to strike midnight. And so she just took off running.

The stage man turned back into the mice. And so she's sitting there in her torn dress and, uh, but she still has one glass slipper. And so she goes back to the house and, um, like the prince is distraught, he found the love of his life and then she just ran off. And so he goes around the kingdom looking for her. He's having every girl he sees try on this glass slipper. 'cause he knows the one that it fits is the one that he loves.

Um, gosh, I must be tired. I must be a little stressed. Um, I'll try to get a lot of sleep tonight and hopefully it'll get better.

I just started walking the Seattle streets and a lot of them are on hills, so there was a lot of up and down. And I made my way to the waterfront and there's a very long, um, water walkway along the pier.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:33    And I started walking and I noticed that my hip was really sore.

And I really, I ignored it because I have a chiropractor at home who can kind of fix this for me. He kind of pops the si joint back into the place and then I'm in good shape. So I remember consciously saying, I'm gonna keep going. I'll deal with this pain later. And what ended up happening is I arrived back home and it was re, the pain was bad and I had a, a long flight back and sitting made it worse. And I got to the chiropractor and he didn't fix it <laugh>. And for months, um, I had the worst case of sciatica ever. I got really scared that it would never resolve.

They had to open up, 'cause there was a, uh, in addition to the tear and the rotator cuff, which was told as a slight tear, there's also a, a growth around the size of a nickel. And so anyway, it had to be open, it had to be open shoulder surgery. And I went with supposedly the best doctor. And, um, anyway, that night, and it was considered a day surgery. That night, the nurse came in and she went to my arm. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? I said, yes. Can you feel this? No, no, no, no, no.

And then like around, oh, I don't know, three, four in the morning, the nurse came in and I think she had me up to here with my pain. And she's like, all right, I'm giving you morphine. And the next thing I knew, she came in and she was like, in my thigh. And that was the morphine. And it was around six o'clock, the surgeon came in and he was doing his rounds for the morning. And he said, um, I heard you had a really bad night. And, you know, open surgery is very difficult, Bridget. And um, you know, it wasn't a, I guess from the time of the m r i, it went from a partial tear to a complete tear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    And the growth that was a nickel was the size of a golf ball. And he also discovered that the bicep was torn while he was in there. And he graft bone from my collarbone. And so basically he was like all over from collarbone all the way down to the bicep and you know, lots of nerves in there, whatever. So he's like, it, it was rough. So I understand that. So I said, okay. And then he said, so for the pain, he said, I can give you another block. Now I had one for the surgery. So now it's like, say six-ish in the morning, he and I was supposed to be day surgery. He said, I can give you another block and it will take you off. He said, but I have to tell you that sometimes with the second block, people lose feeling in their fingers. Like, and it doesn't ever resolve itself. Now I'm more, you know, still still have the morphine in my system. But yet I remember this and I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. 'cause I was remembering what the nurse said that I, you know, 24 hours and it was kind of like, it did concern me the night before. So I was like, I don't know. I don't know. And he said, well, Bridget, he said, you, um, I I, I gotta see everybody else on the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Floor.

So I was like, so I was like, but I may never get, he goes, well it's 50 50, it doesn't happen to somebody, but you know, your chances increased. So boom off he's gone. And I was like fighting to stay awake. 'cause I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school at high school. And I wanted to tell him, Bruce, do not let him give me the second block. Which eventually Bruce disappeared. I told him that. I told him everything I just told you. I'm like, I don't want the block. Meanwhile, I was out of my mind in pain. There was a wonderful male nurse. He kept me there till like four o'clock that afternoon. So I surpassed the day surgery timeline and finally they discharged me, uh, PS medicine. That was July of 2010. And then I went home, and then the next two weeks were just horrific. I had no feeling.

So she was covered in Cinder, and I dunno if that's a Disney movie, but I know that's the original story, <laugh>. So, um, so as she's growing up, she's forced to do all these chores and she's, she's mistreated and she's basically made for all of them. And she kind of looks at the castle and she like dreams of, you know, kind of going and meeting the prince and, uh, living a better life.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:58    So one day, um, they, the castle decides that they, the prince needs to marry and needs a princess. So they decide to have a ball for him, to meet someone to marry. And her household gets an invitation. So Cinderella gets excited and learns to sew and sew. Its a really pretty dress, and that's wearing a really pretty necklace. And, um, she gets all her chores done and gets ready to go to the ball. And then her stepsisters decide, well, like, they don't want her to go, they don't like her, they mistreat her, so they tear up her dress and ruin everything. Um, so now she can't go to the ball. Um, and they dress up and they go without her. And while she is crying, her fairy godmother appears. Um, and all throughout this, I'm sure they're singing a bunch of random songs that I don't know.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    But then, um, so she makes Cinderella a really pretty dress with glass slippers. And, uh, the whole while, while Cinderella was growing up without any friends, she befriended like her household animals like the mice and like the horses and, and whatnot. So the fairy godmother turns, turns them all into like a really nice carriage. The carriage made outta the pumpkin. And the mice are the drivers and the horse become like really beautiful white horses. And they take her in her dress to the, to the ball, but she has to be backed by midnight or everything will turn back to normal. It'll be her like bad dress and the character will turn back into a pumpkin. So she goes to the ball and people don't recognize her, and she dances with the prince. And then all of a sudden she realized the clock is about to strike midnight. So she runs away and she was the glass slipper while she's running away. And um, so yeah, she gets, she gets halfway back from what I remember, and the carriage  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Turns back into a pumpkin and she turns back into her, her ripped dress. But the one glass slipper she still has, stays the same. So, um, and she's really happy. She had this great night and then the prince comes like sending all of his, his men and guards looking for Cinderella by seeing if the, who's like foot the glass slipper fits. So, um, Cinderella's stepsisters end up blocking her away and then her mice friends bring her a key to get her out of there. Um, and uh, but Prince's servant comes with a glass slipper to put it on Cinderella. And as he's like running and seeing that there's like another girl who hasn't tried the slipper on in, in the city or in the town, um, the stepmother trips him and the glass slipper breaks and everyone's all sad 'cause now they'll never find this girl. And then cinder was like, well, I have the other glass slipper. \n"}, {"job_id": "WjtCRs4IEV1STDMx", "filename": "wright40a_472028_710033.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 1    00:00:27    Okay. A little boy is leaving the house with his backpack and his mother is going to give him an umbrella, but he declines the umbrella, tells his mother bye, starts to rain. Doesn't have an umbrella. Now it's really raining. He's all wet. He comes home and mother is looking very cross at her very wet sun. And he gets the umbrella. And now he's dryer. The end story of Cinderella. Cinderella,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    Um,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:07    Lived with her father and her dog. One day. He brings home a new wife and her two daughters. Now the father has to go away and leaves the stepmother in charge. Her daughters, the stepsisters are evil and mean, and the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry. They get a notice because the prince has to get married and the king is just beside himself. He must find a wife, so they're going to have a ball so that he can pick out a wife.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:49    And Cinderella says, oh, may I go too? Well, if you get all of your chores done and then help your sisters get ready, then if you have any time, you can go with us. So they give her all kinds of work to do. In meantime, her little friends, the mice help with getting her dress ready. Now, the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they don't want. They're no good. So they take 'em and make her dress. She has this pretty little dress, and she's ready on time. The evil stepsisters take the, the necklace and the ribbon, and they just rip it right off of her dress and off they go to the ball. Cinderella is very, very sad, sitting outside, crying to her mice friends and her dog, when her fairy godmother comes and says, well, you get to go to the ball. And she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses, and takes her over to the ball.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:54    She looks very nice. She dances with Prince Charming. They have a wonderful time, but she, she has to be at back by midnight. So when the clock strikes 12, she runs down the stairs, but she loses a slipper. One of her glass slippers, she gets home just in time, but she has to walk because the pumpkin, the, the carriage turned back into a pumpkin. The, the horses turned back into mice and the dog turned, uh, the footman turned back into a dog. So then, um, the, uh, I guess the, uh, duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe and asking all the maidens throughout the village. So they get to Cinderella's house and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom so that she can't try it on just in case. And, and the oldest stepdaughter, stepsister tries on the shoe, and it's too small. \n"}, {"job_id": "i0gYlhSMF4ZE1yV1", "filename": "NEURAL19-2_948749_1186699.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Um, so, so Cinderella lived in a home with her uncle and a little dog. And there was an opportunity for her uncle to send Cinderella to live with, uh, a relative and her daughters, which were Cinderella's cousins. And the hope was that they would all become friends and that Cinderella would enjoy having, um, people like sisters around her. But what happened instead is that she was put in a position of, of servitude with her aunt and cousins, and she actually became, um, kind of an indentured servant. So she would serve them and clean. And she didn't even live in the house. She lived with the barn animals who became her friends. Um, and she would daydream in the barn about visiting a castle in the kingdom that was far away, but she could see it in the valley in the distance.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    But she imagined it would be a long, long distance to ever be able to visit the castle. But one day an invitation came from the prince that he was having a ball, and he invited Cinderella's aunt and sisters, and she assumed that she could go. And her barnyard friends revealed a secret chest to her, uh, which she opened to a book of magic. And from that book of magic, she was able to conjure a dress and pearls to wear to this gown, uh, to this event. And she arrived to a accompany her, her kin, and they absolutely  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Rejected the possibility of her going. They ripped the necklace off her neck, and she was in despair. So from this treasure chest and this book of magic, a fairy godmother appeared a wise, powerful, older woman. And she granted Cinderella's wish of attending the ball, but to do so, she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance. So surrender Cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and new hair and makeup, so she was virtually unrecognizable. And as a final touch, her fairy godmother created a pumpkin coach and a, uh, fleet of horses to take her to the special. \n"}, {"job_id": "nWdsyjCvlJwwpIPi", "filename": "richardson184_304353_542266.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. So, um, it starts off with Cinderella. I don't know if that's her actual name. I don't think it's, anyway, um, she's a young girl and her dad, um, remarries, and the stepmom has two daughters of her own. Um, then when the stepdad die or the, the dad dies, um, Cinderella is left on her own with her stepmom and her two stepsisters. Um, and she's kind of made to be, um, made to be maid <laugh>. Um, um, she, she, I forgot <laugh>. Um, okay. I know the next picture is like her playing with a cat. Um, so she's responsible for all the chores. Um, then, um, they get an invitation to the ball, and the two, um, stepsisters are really excited. Um, and Cinderella wants to go as well. Um, so the mice make her dress, um, with the stepsisters, it leftover materials. Um, but when the stepsisters see that they, or that her dress is like made of all their unwanted clothes, um, they were up.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    So she's really sad. And, um, she goes out in the garden and the god fairy godmother comes to her and, um, makes for, makes her a, I don't even know what it's called, not a wagon. Um, I cannot think of that word right now. Um, really nice dress, a carriage. There we go. Um, with horses, um, a doorman, I think. Um, she goes to the ball meets the prince. Um, they dance and then it strikes 12, so she has to leave and, and her leaving in a hurry, she, um, loses a shoe. Um, so then the next day, um, I guess he's the king's advisor. He goes, um, all around the kingdom to see which shoe or to find the girl who shoe it was. Um, but Cinderella is locked in her room.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Um, so she can't turn on the shoe. And then the mice bring the key to her. She unlocks the door, um, goes downstairs, but the stepmother tripped the guy who's carrying the shoe. So the shoe breaks. Um, but luckily Cinderella still has one. Um, they put it on, it fits, and they live happily ever after. Okay, great. All right, so I just have one more thing that I'm gonna ask you to do. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Jelly <laugh>, but I would take two pieces of bread, um, put it on a plate.

It could be happy or sad from any time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:31    Yes. Um, I purchased my house and I live towards the end of a dead end and I was so excited because I thought given the road that I live on, it will be safe to let my animals go outside. And it actually was the spring, it was in early April, quite a long time ago. And I came home and I found, um, my kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home. It was unspeakable. Um, and it was devastating because I came to this place with this vision of safety for my animals. So it was very, very upsetting and um, I went through grief. Um, and then I did some prayers and time passed and it was coming up on summer solstice, so it was in June. And I started imagining, 'cause the kidney I lost was a girl.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:50    She was my only female. Um, and I thought, gosh, my household really needs a female kitty. And if, if, if a cat would just happen to cross my path, I would consider adopting a female. And if that cat just happened to be a tortoise shell, that would be even better. So I went to a party, um, hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country and she was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born, um, on her land. And there was one left and she was just a little tor the shell, female kitty <laugh>. So I took that as a sign, um, that she was meant to be mine. Yeah.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:46    Another series of pictures. When you're ready, tell me this story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:54    Okay. Um, the janitor at school was taking a break in the lounge, which happens to be near the soccer field. Some kids were playing on the field outside practicing, and one of them kicked a ball and it went through the window into the lounge and knocked over a lamp next to where the janitor was sitting. He was shocked and not injured, but he did get up and look out the window to see what had happen. \n"}, {"job_id": "qB6dFkoiToOIUu6c", "filename": "NEURAL62-1_19044_256930.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Uh, I had a significant auto accident, uh, when I was 33, and I was, uh, in a company car selling pharmaceuticals, dropping my children off on the east side of Indianapolis when I was struck in the side by a car coming the other direction. And, uh, my children were okay, but I have possibly no memory of it because after a time you don't know what you remember versus what's been told. But I had, um, some pretty severe injuries. I had a severe concussion. I had a kidney laceration, broken ribs, and four pelvic fractures. So that, uh, let's see. I was taken to a hospital on the east side. My almost husband picked up my children and took them to my mother. I was in the hospital for two weeks and, uh, I couldn't, when I was released, I was on crutches with no weightbearing for, uh, most of the summer. Um, we used a wheelchair and I just kind of managed to heal and in, let's see. So that was, uh, I had no complications after that. And then I think it was three months almost exactly that I was able to walk again and we were married.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:27    So that's the biggest thing that's happened to me.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:30    Wow.

Um, well, obviously living with someone with aphasia, especially moderate to severe is difficult. And you do learn different ways to communicate and then sometimes you just don't. Um, one story that I can think of, we, he was able to drive, uh, but not use a phone, which he still doesn't really use a phone. And we were supposed to meet at a hotel on the north side of Indianapolis for some sort of a meeting. I can't remember what it was. And he was coming separately and I got there and time went on and went on. What I learned from this, he was driving up and down Meridian Street. He knew it was a hotel. He knew it was somewhere on Meridian Street, but he didn't know which hotel, and he had no way to call me, and I had no way to call him. And what I learned from that experience, and I, I can't say I'm a hundred percent perfect on it even today, but his auditory comprehension is horrible.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:14    And if I wanna be sure he understands, it needs to be written down because he understands what he sees. But like most people with aphasia, they are the best fakers in the world, but they don't really mean to be, they just want to have it be the way it used to be. And so they'll nod their head. Yeah, they understand and they don't understand. I've asked him for something from my garage and he'll come in with something instead of saying, huh. So I know he didn't understand.

And so I hired on as a social worker. And during the first week, uh, the welfare department hired many social workers and I met another woman who was hired at the same time I was. And we became friends and got an apartment together and she introduced me to a man who had gone to the same school as she had gone to in Michigan. And that gentleman and I, uh, fell in love and remarried. It was a very pleasant marriage. Uh, it was a church wedding and the sister that I had gone to visit in Seattle was my maid of honor. And we, uh, stayed in Washington. My husband was teaching at Port Orchard, which was just across the bay from Seattle. And we lived there for the first year until we moved back to Seattle. And that was how I met and married my husband. The young boy appears to be practicing soccer because he is kicking a soccer ball, which I assume accidentally goes into a window and breaks the window. There's a gentleman sitting in the living room, um, next to the window and the ball comes through the broken window and knocks over the lamp and the man picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window to see if he can tell where the soccer ball came from.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:26    Alright. A little boy is leaving the house and his mother tries to get him to take an umbrella with him, but he is so happy not to have the umbrella. And when he opens the door, it is not raining.

But then he decides it's all right to take the umbrella and out he goes with the umbrella to prevent the rain from making him wet. Oh, all right. There is a young girl in the flood waters, probably a river, um, and the water is all around her, but there is a man with a life jacket on him who is trying to rescue her, and he is grasping a branch of a tree that overhangs the water and he is going to rescue her.

I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guion Beret syndrome, and that's a type of, uh, paralyzing, it's kind of, it's, I think it was called French Polio. 'cause the men were from France. And, uh, I was on a vacation out over in San Diego with friends, and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet. And, uh, I was stumbling. I was having a hard time walking and I knew something was wrong and I just, uh, I really kind of thought it was fate. I thought maybe I had a brain tumor or something really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned on going to, uh, universal Studios and I wasn't in pain, so, but I was just having a hard time walking. Yeah. Beret starts at your fingers and toes, and then it works, works in, so I can't, I can remember this going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair, <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    So by that evening, by the time we all go back to our hotel, I was really, uh, quite concerned. I did sleep. And the next morning they took me to, uh, Scripps Medical Center in the San Diego area. And the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Deon Bray, um, A effects, it's, it's a autoimmune disease. And he asked me if I had had the flu recently, and I had, and so the, the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system, and this was what was happening me. So they told, first they wanted to admit me to the hospital, and I said, no way. I, I was going back to Phoenix, uh oh. And they did cer, they asked me to like, shuffle a deck of cards. I couldn't do that. And, uh, snapped my fingers. I couldn't do that. So, uh, I got back in the car with my friends and, uh, my daughter was with us, and, uh, he said, if you have trouble breathing, because it can go all the way and it's, you know, affects your muscle, affects your muscles to, um, find the nearest hospital. But I got back home and, uh, it took me about oh, six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery for about six weeks. I couldn't drive a car. I couldn't, uh, I could feed myself, but I couldn't cut anything up. I could shower, but I couldn't turn on the shower. I had no strength of my hands or my feet. I couldn't, um, stand on my toes, any of that kind of thing. So then I started it  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Wherever it goes, you know, from the inside, from the outside to the inside of your body, and then it stops. And as your, your body stops, starts healing again, then it was a slow, uh, recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit. But I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister. She was living with us at the time, and I just felt like an old lady. And this was over 20 years ago, so I was in my forties and I was just holding on to the grocery cart for dear life because my balance was so poor and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over. But it, um, I recovered. I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands. I, I can occasionally have a hand tremor, but I feel like I'm 99% better. \n"}, {"job_id": "EMBmXfxZh9DR92ye", "filename": "capilouto22a_121816_359632.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Um, five years ago I was, uh, I am a realtor and I was very, very busy that entire year. That was 2003. Um, I had sold more property, closed more closings than ever had, and started feeling, uh, short of breath. So, um, I went to the doctor, like in June. My doctor was in, uh, class taking some extra classes for something, and so I saw another doctor and, uh, he gave me blood pressure medication and I continued to work, work, work, work. Um, finally in October, my doctor came back and I went back to her with a list of symptoms and she decided I needed a stress test because I'd never had one. And this was a nuclear stress test. So, um, I took my stress test and the doctor turned his back and started talking to his assistant, and I thought, uhoh. And, um, he turned and looked at me and said, you have flunked your stress test, and I want you back in one of my rooms immediately.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    I think you have considerable, um, cardiovascular problems. So anyway, um, he wanted me to go into the hospital the next day for a heart cath, and I told him I was sorry, uh, I couldn't do that. I, I had an appointment, real estate appointment that was very, very important to me and to the lady that I was working with. And, and he said, what about Thursday? And I said, I can't do it Thursday. And he's, um, his glasses are going further down on his nose and he said, how about Friday? And I said, that'll work. I can, I can do it Friday. So anyway, I go for my heart cath on Friday, and, um, he didn't even let me sit up afterwards. He said, you have blockages and I want you to have surgery today. And so, um, I had triple bypass surgery that afternoon.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    And, um, so that was pretty traumatic because my family never thought of me as ever being sick. It was, they worried a lot about their father, but they didn't worry about mom because I was constantly going and doing and everything. So anyway, I had the surgery. Um, my re recovery was, was good. I had a good attitude. I never once got depressed because I felt so grateful that, that it had my problems had been found and I could go on. And, um, so I went through cardiac re rehab at Central Baptist and I did everything  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    They told me to do. And, um, I was in rehab for probably about six months and, um, have recovered. Um, however, two years later I did find that two of my bypasses were blocked. And it's, um, it's a genetic thing. I'd done everything. I was told to do diet. I'd been doing the diet thing for years, and so I had to have, um, a stent and then a year later I had to have another stent. I, so since then I have done, well, it's, um, it's been two years now since I had a stent. And, um, I'm, I'm back to normal as far as I'm concerned.

'cause he was, he's a wolf. He was raised as a, in a wolf pack. And so he doesn't know how creepy this is, but he also kind of wants to eat her. So he is a little bit aware of how creepy this is. And Red Riding Hood's like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers. And the wolf says, show me what you've got in your past scratch. And he rifles through a basket because obviously he can take it. He's a wolf and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own because that's smart. And I'm not sure what happens.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:48    I guess he just, he's like, he talks to her, that's what it is. He talks to her and he says, what you're doing with this basket kid?

She gives him really explicit instructions to how to get to her grandma's cottage. 'cause she's six years old and dumb. And the wolf drops the basket and he says, oh, that sounds great. Bye. I'm never gonna see you again. Don't look for me at your grandma's place. I'm definitely not going there. And he bounce off in the direction of the lightning struck tree and the rock that looks like Ronald Schwartzenegger and Little Red Riding Hood says, that was completely ordinary.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:44    I see nothing suspicious about this. And she picks up all the stuff and puts it back in the basket and starts going on to grandma's. And obviously before she gets there, the wolf gets to grandma's cottage and he listens at the door and he hears grandma singing along to Led Zeppelin and says, grandma clearly can't hear me because she's singing along to that heavy metal music. So he opens the door and he knocks grandma out and ties her up and put her in the closet where she just sits there kind of sniffling and humming, led Zeppelin to herself. And he turns down her crazy tunes and gets into her bed. No, no. He has to make, he has to take her clothes first. He's a weird wolf. Social graces not his forte. He gets gRED onto her underwear, puts on grandma's nighty, and like her cap and stuff, he doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too. But he puts on her night cap and then he ties her up and stuffs her in her closet to sniffle and hums Zeppelin. And he gets into her bed and he pulls the covers up right here and waits for Little Red Riding Hood. And Little Red Riding Hood comes up to Grandma's Door eventually, probably like  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Half an hour later 'cause she's six. And she knocks on the door and the wolf says, oh, come in dear. And the Red Riding Hood says, that's weird. My grandma never calls me dear, but I trust this situation implicitly. And so she comes in and she looks over to the bed and her first response is not, there's a wolf in my grandma's bed. Her first response is, hi grandma. I'm six and I'm stupid. And she goes up to the bed and her grandma says, oh her grandma. The wolf says, oh, what did you bring me dear? And she says, well, I brought you stuff from my mom. 'cause I heard you were sick from dancing naked in the rain. You need to not do that so often, but you should also tell me what to do to dance better in the rain naked. And the wolf says, okay, he doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain. He's got a fur coat on at all times. But he's willing to improvise. \n"}, {"job_id": "fKw0aKgfj7lVmmQ1", "filename": "richardson21_405805_643550.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Cinderella lived with her father and presumably her mother died. I think that's what happened in the original story. I don't know what Disney said, but that's not important because what is important is that when she was a little girl, little cheerful girl, very nice. Her father remarried to this not very nice woman who had two not very nice daughters, who had big noses and angry eyes, and basically, I'm pretty sure her father died also. Um, I don't remember that from the movie. I figure it must've been, you know, too tragic for kids. You, it's grand brother's thing. They kill everybody's parents off. So Cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters and no parental, you know, oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the servant, basically the slave of this family. She doesn't get paid.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    Um, and her only friends are the cute little furry animals like mice and dogs and horses. There's a cat named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure aptly named. Um, there's a cat named Lucifer who belongs to the stepfamily, who is always terrorizing her mice friends. And so she has to protect them. And they're all, you know, good buddies. They sing songs together. And then one day, the king in the castle, up in the distance, very far away, that looks longingly out the window. 'cause she wants something she can't have because that is the fundamental passive human assistance, the king says to his advisor, I want my son to get married because he's getting on years and he wants a grandkid, pretty much is his only motivation for that, which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your he parent to get married to me. But the heart wants what it wants <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:58    And so he decides, the king decides to throw this enormous ball to which every single eligible maiden in the kingdom will be invited. And by eligible maiden, I mean probably over the age of 13 and not already married, the TRO goal is probably negotiable. So the stepfamily and Cinderella get the invitation and they're all psyched because this is great. One of them could marry the prince, not Cinderella, obviously, because she's hideous and not worth it, but one of the stepdaughters could. And so leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited. And Cinderella, her mice and bird buddies make her dress because they want her to go to the ball also because they're just nice. They're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this and she gets so excited because this means she can go to the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Ball and she puts on the dress and she goes downstairs to meet her stepfamily at the door for them to get into the carriage to go off to the ball. And they say to themselves, nah. And they rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable so she can't go to the ball because they're mean. And at this point, Cinderella's kind of crying to herself, and I'm inclined to be like crying to herself because she's a baby. But also I would probably cry because that was a nice dress. And like if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she's sitting there crying and all of a sudden her fairy godmother comes. Why? She has a fairy godmother. Nobody's really sure, presumably because she's so pure of heart. But her fairy godmother comes and says, BTY bty boo. And everything is wonderful. And the pumpkin turns into a carriage. The dogs turn into horses. \n"}, {"job_id": "EjPsC2VhmaDgst4d", "filename": "richardson17_1101887_1339604.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Yeah, it's 'cause she's so pretty, but she won't stay that way.

And he's so taken with how beautiful Snow White is, even though she's dead, he kisses her. And that doesn't seem like the type of husband that I would want to have. But he's a prince and I guess her prince came. So she wakes up and they're in love and the doors are happy and we all learn. The more of the story is to just maim people instead of kill them <laugh> and to not accept food from strangers. The end, they live happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:57    Now, I want you to tell me as much of the story of Little Red Riding as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as pictures you just looked at.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    Okay. Once upon in time there was a girl and because she went everywhere and her red Cape, everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood. Okay? So Little Red Riding Hood lives at her house with her parents. And one day her mother says to her, little Red Riding Hood, I'm going to prepare a basket for you to take to your grandmother's house. And I even think that her mother and gives her advice about the path to take to grandmother's house to take the, you know, the most direct path and not to lolly gag because that's when travel happens. And so Little Red Riding Hood, actually I think in the, in my story, little Red Riding Hood actually wants to take the most direct path. But the, there's some reason why she can't. And I think it has something to do with a signpost, <laugh> being, oh, I know why.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:11    Because the Wolf spies little Red Riding Hood coming with a bags ski to her grandmother's house. And he says, oh, little girl, where are you going? And she says, I'm going to my grandmother's house. You shouldn't talk to strangers. That's bad and don't tell them where you're going. And so he jumps ahead of her in the path on the way to her grandmother's house and switches the sign so as to delay her arriving at her grandmother's house. So the wolf goes to grandmother's house and he, um, oh, doesn't knock on the door. That's a different story. <laugh>, he gets in the grandmother's house and he gobbles her up whole. That's important. And um, little meanwhile, little Red Riding Hood is un, un does not know that this happened. And the wolf, who I think his end objective is to eat Little Red Riding Hood, which you would think he would be stated by eating grandma, but he's not. Um, puts on grandmother's clothes and gets into her bed, which isn't creepy. It's a fairy tale. Um, and when Little Red Riding Hood arrives, he lures her in, um, by acting like grandmother. And then, um, little Red Riding Hood notices, keen Little Red Riding Hood keenly notices that her grandmother's acting really weird. And she says, oh, grandma, what big hand you had?

So,  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:15    Cinderella's dad, Mary remarried a woman with two um, daughters, and the dad died. And so the stepmother kind of made her a servant in her own home.

And, um, they, they treat her very badly because she's the, the step relative, and they make her do all the work around the house, the cleaning and all. They sit around and bomb moms and get that. And one day a letter comes to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing a SL party for his son who is going to listen for a bride.

I have to know nothing theologically to be an administrative mentor. I just have to be able to do paperwork. We have, uh, six members in our class, and one is a lady who is in wheelchair, who has in the past attempted suicide. She is a, a neat lady and, uh, she has a lot of difficulty communicating.

And on October the 28th, uh, 2007, what I thought was going to be a small intimate wedding, uh, at St. Michael's Church turned into a grand gala affair with a couple hundred people and a perception that was real, real well done.

So, I, uh, and my asthma is, uh, most frequently triggered by allergy issues. And in particular, I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle because they're non shedding dogs. And I am allergic to all cats very badly. And I'm also allergic to in trees and various molds, grasses, yada, yada, yada. But, uh, cats are probably the worst culprit for me. Um, so when I was in high school, probably a freshman or sophomore in high school, I think, um, my sisters were out of the house at that point.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:11    So it was just me living with my mom and dad. And one summer we took a vacation, uh, down, no, it was in the fall. It was in the fall, and we went down for like an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why, did not really think about the fact that they had two dogs and a cat, I believe, shedding dogs and a cat. So we were gonna stay two nights with them. So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner, and I could tell I was starting to feel, oh, and, and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother, having been, my mother always could look across the room. And when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say, it's time for you to go, isn't it?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    Um, so we kind of reached that point, but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room. People try that kind of thing, which of course never works 'cause the animal lives there. Um, and I, and I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there, but we did. And, or maybe I said, oh, I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I took medicine and, and, um, whatnot. But by the middle of the night, I was beyond okay. And it was, you know, to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe. And there were no inhalers back in those days. It was liquid medicine that A, was less effective and b took a long time to activate. Plus, if you stay in the space where the stimulus is, your medicine's  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Only gonna last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night, I could bear it no longer. And my loving, loving father, um, said, uh, let's go to the car and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night, and I, so then the next day I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were, but we spent enough time in the house. I just couldn't get past it. I was, I was so, um, affected and I'm not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did stay in that house that night, but it just continued to get worse. And by that next evening we had to go to the er. And back in those days, I suppose they do something.

There's this little boy, probably 10, 12 years old, and he's out playing soccer, just having a really fun time. And, um, the ball goes through possibly maybe the neighbor's window or maybe it's his own front window.

I love this one because this is typical, typical of kids and mothers. Okay? So the little boy is getting ready to go to school. He has a backpack on, and his mom says, I think it's gonna rain today. We take their umbrella, umbrella, and the little boy goes, no, I'm not gonna take it. It's not gonna rain, trust me. Okay? Kids think they're smarter than the parents, but they're not. And the mom says, you need the umbrella, but he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside and it starts to ring. Ha ha ha. And so the little boy comes back home, <laugh>, and he's um, he's soaking wet, and he comes back in and his mother is a little upset with them because in her mind she says, I told you so.

Her mother had died a long time ago, and her father had decided it's time that you had a mother and you need some brothers and sisters. So he went out into the town and he found a woman who he thought he could like, and he married her and brought her and her two daughters into the house and told Cinderella, here you go. Here's your family. Uh, you now have a new mother and you have new sisters go along with it. Well, what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet, and they treated Cinderella horribly. They made her do all the cooking. They made her do all the cleaning while he was off sailing around the world. That's why I wasn't around. That's why I didn't know what was going on.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:47    So, uh, the Cinderella is having to do all the housework and she's taking care of everything. And the evil si stepsisters are just, you know, bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do. So Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were, uh, there in the farm area, and she would talk to them and they would talk to her because they had that special communication. Um, then one day from where Cinderella was at, she, when she was talking with the animals, she could see like the whole town that she lived in, and off the distance she could see the castle where the prince lived. And she always thought, wow, it would be so neat if I could live in a castle. That would just be amazing, but I'm Cinderella and that won't ever happen because I have to make sure that I have to take care of my stepmother and my evil stepsisters.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    Meanwhile, over in the castle, uh, the advisor to the prince is starting to get worried because the prince is still single and people in the town are starting to talk. So he is a little bit worried about it. So he says, okay, here's what we'll do. We will put this whole proclamation thing out and we will get all the single ladies to come to the castle, and we'll let the prince pick one. You know, with all the women, there's gotta be one that he's gonna like. So we'll bring 'em all here. So they send out a message to everybody in the village, in the town. They say, okay, we're having this big birthday party for the Prince. Bring your single daughters over here. And because he's gonna be picking a wife, and the evil stepmother gets this message, and she says, well, this is great.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:27    I'm gonna put my daughters, because then we can get outta this val and move back into a big castle and we'll be all rich and famous. And Cinderella thinks, wow, that'd be kind of cool. Um, maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at, you know, sewing and everything, and I've actually made a dress so you know, I should be able to go too, because it says all the single daughters. So she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room and the stepsisters see it and decide, wow, she looks a lot better than we do, so we can't let that happen.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    So they rip up her dress, and then they take her and they like shove her in a closet and lock her away, and then they take off and go. And Cinderella is really sad. And she's like, oh no, this is really a bummer. And while she's upset, she finds this book. And while flipping through the book, she sees a reference to a fairy godmother. So she reads the reference and all of a sudden, poof, fairy godmother shows up and she says, well, Cinderella, I'm here to help you out, uh, because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things. I'm gonna grant you some wishes and we're gonna get you to this ball. And so Cinderella says, okay, well what, how do we make this happen? She said, well, first we need a way to get you there. So she takes Cinderella's little animal, animal friends, and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her to the ball. She turns the mice into Coachman and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into, uh, a big carriage. So she does all of this, and then she's. \n"}, {"job_id": "KxHosbUYztHA4Iyo", "filename": "NEURAL11-2_486327_723877.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    They're calling for rain.

So the boy turned around and went back home and told his mother, okay, you were right. I needed my umbrella. And she was none too happy about that. And she gave him his umbrella and he turned around and went back to school.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:28    Take a look at this picture and everything that's happening, and then tell me a story about what you see with the beginning, a middle and an end.

So the little girl was playing in her yard, riding her tricycle when all of a sudden a dog ran into the yard and chased her cat up the tree. She was very upset because she couldn't get her cat down, so she yelled for her dad who was in the house to see if he could help. So he tried to cut, climb up the tree and get the cat, but he wasn't able to reach the cat either. And the dog continued to bark at the base of the tree. The next thing that happened was the little girl's mother called the fire department to see if they could come and help. So the firefighters came with their ladder and they're heading to the tree as well. And hopefully they'll be able to get up there and get the cat and shoo the dog away.

So Cinderella went to live with her stepmother and stepsisters when she was very small, her father had, um, become a widow widower and went to live with his new wife. The father passed away and Cinderella was left to live with her stepmother and evil stepsisters. They didn't treat Cinderella very well, always asking her to do things around the house, whereas the stepsisters were very, um, spoiled and got to do whatever they wanted. One day the prince in the village sent out a declaration that he was looking for a princess, and he was going to have a ball to invite, and he invited all of the young women in the village to come to the ball. The steps were very excited to go to this, and Cinderella overheard and really wanted to go to the ball as. \n"}, {"job_id": "Wh5hpSkyarMhVyON", "filename": "wright42a_240_237788.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Mom had planned a birthday party. It was going to be the fourth birthday party for her, her youngest boy. She had set out a, the most beautiful cake. Well, the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake, so he got himself a big mouthful and got his paws into it too, and ran and hid underneath the sofa so that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom. The little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined, and his mom was trying to hit his dog. Um, in the meantime, the guests started showing up at the door, uh, carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on. You make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking, uh, two pieces of bread. You, on one side you spread the peanut butter, and on the other side you spread the jelly and then you put the two together.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    Oh, my, uh, and about 19 84, 85, it's been a long time. Um, I had my four wisdom teeth extracted. Um, I had, as a precaution, I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so that I wouldn't get an infection. Um, 'cause when I was seven years old, I had rheumatic fever and they always told me, well, your immune system isn't gonna be near as strong, so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery, including oral surgery. So I did that, and the, that evening, I, early evening, my throat swelled up. Uh, don't know if it was from the penicillin or what, but, um, I ended up back at the dentist's office and they ended up having to take, uh, some epinephrine. They gave me shots of epinephrine, I think two of 'em. And they also took a syringe and sprayed it on my throat to help the swelling go down.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:24    Uh, shortly after that, I was diagnosed with something called an, um, they called it then angio neurotic Edema. Uh, but it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called, uh, hereditary angioedema. Uh, the difference between angioedema and hereditary angioedema is the angioedema, which is like the hives can be treated with antihistamines, hereditary angioedema cannot. It has to be the only thing that is, until recently, the only thing that was known that could counteract that, um, during an episode was the epinephrine. Um, during that time, shortly after I was diagnosed, my throat again swelled up just out of the clear blue, uh, and went to urgent care. Um, in urgent care, they started an IV on me and the doctor, I don't know if she was a doctor or a pa. Um, anyway, she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline in the iv. Okay? And anybody who's ever had adrenaline knows that's the wrong place to give it. It goes intermuscular. It can't, it's not to be intravenous, um, because it takes within just a few seconds, it takes your heart rate from a normal 72 up to like 150 or 180 beats a minute. \n"}, {"job_id": "tyLd3UAgHfbff772", "filename": "wright20a_1814066_2051605.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    On when I commuted between GR and Cheyenne, if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning, I stayed over  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:09    <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:11    All good.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:14    Um,  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:15    Now I'm going to show you some pictures.

There was a nice young man who lost his wife, um, was very sad, had a little girl that was just as precious as can be, and he knew that she needed a mom. So he found a woman, um, with two daughters and they decided to marry. So now little Cinderella, his daughter has two stepsisters. They grow up in the house together, but they're very, very different children. The two stepsisters are very vain, um, very selfish and force Cinderella to do all the work in the house instead of them helping out. And the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen. So Cinderella, because she works so hard, has no friends. And except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house and they befriend her, she sees the prince's castle from afar and often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle as a princess.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    Meanwhile, in that castle, there's a prince, and the prince's father is very frustrated because his son is just not interested in meeting women and marrying. And the king is definitely ready for his son to get married. So he decides to host a ball and bring all the beautiful ladies of the area to the ball. And so he sends out invitations. And when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations, the girls are very, very excited because now they can see themselves married to the prince. And Cinderella also shares in this dream. However, Cinderella stepmother says, oh no, you can't go to the ball because you have too many chores to do, and forces Cinderella to do even more chores because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters and does not want that competition for her daughters. So they get all ready to go to the ball and Cinderella goes through all her chores, but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    So they help her with the chores. But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball 'cause she doesn't have a dress. And so in a puff of magic, her fairy godmother comes to her and says, I will help you Cinderella. So she, um, makes a beautiful dress up here with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball that is made out of a pumpkin. And the mice she makes waves her magic wand and makes into fine horses that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball. So in the meantime, just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though, she says, remember  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    This spell is only good until midnight. And after midnight, the coach will turn back into a pumpkin and your little, the horses will turn back into your little friends again. So make sure you're out of there by midnight. So Cinderella goes to the ball and nobody recognizes her because she's dressed beautifully, she's clean, she smells good, and the prince is so taken with her. He cannot believe his luck that he has found this beautiful young woman and falls in love with her, instantly love at first sight. Um, but as they're taking one of their last dances, she hears the gong from the clock tower and knows that it is midnight and she knows she has to leave quickly, but he doesn't want her to leave. And he holds her back and she says, no, I must go. And she runs out of his arms, runs down the stairs, trips just a little bit before she gets into her coat. \n"}, {"job_id": "c0fr16ZUuQWCujCw", "filename": "NEURAL5-2_421728_659214.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    All right. Uh, I don't know if you've heard this or not, if I mentioned this. Uh, one of the things that I have been doing for the last 10, 12 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis at Riley Children's Hospital, and it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or, uh, has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So, um, I've very much have learned from that a, not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult, that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them. And that has, that is a lesson because it's easy to make that assumption, as I'm sure you know. Um, so I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact, from their facial expressions, from their, um, motions that may be jerky, that may be just excitement that that is a response to the story. And while I can, I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understanding and capacity with this story, I can sense their emotional and response to whatever it is that they do understand in the story. And it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection, even when there is no speech coming back on their end.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:54    So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad, or from any time from you were a kid, or more recently? I'm going to mute myself now and you can begin.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:10    Okay. Uh, this time I will tell you about the birth of my first child. Um, so, uh, it was 22 years ago, uh, on March 14th. I was due on March 9th. I'd had the good fortune of having a fairly benign, um, you know, easy pregnancy. Uh, and nothing had happened. Nothing had happened. We were on to day five after the due date. And I, that day was singing in a, a very unusual thing, singing with a choir that I was part of, a small chamber group, I should say, that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So, um, I went to the wedding and we sang, and I did kind of notice that, um, you know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but, you know, whatever. Uh, and, and the wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I, I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial. And, um, I called my sister who lived, I was in Sacramento at the time. She was in Southern California, and she is five years older than me and three kids older than me. So she already has three children.

And the shelf I keep the garbage bags on is maybe six inches high. So she still brought me the garbage bags and she gave me very puzzled, looked like she doesn't what I was gonna do with them. So I said, hold the bag out, let me get the blanket for you. And I pull up the blanket and I put it in the garbage bag. And she said, how's this gonna fit on the shelf?

They ended up calling like the fire department or the police department. We were really scared. We weren't gonna get Bonita out. And she had no air in there. But the fire department came and they had to take the hinges off the door to get Bonita out of the closet. And she was just sobbing. We were all scared that she wasn't getting outta the closet.

So when I was about five, I, I had a, uh, allergic reaction and my skin would turn purple. So I was bedridden and I missed my kindergarten starting date. And, um, eventually my allergic reaction was traced to my tonsils and my tonsils. So they, they took away my tonsils. And I remember being said, ice cream, all the ice cream you can eat after the operation. And once that was taken away, I was back to normal. Um, one of the things that has stuck in my mind, as I say, I can't remember exactly, but I think I was about four and this thing went on for about three months. So one of the things that, uh, I remember was that I was not supposed to move very much. I was supposed to, uh, be in bed and not moving very much. And whenever I was left alone, I remember that I would jump on the bed as a sign of rebellion against this order, this doctor's order that I was to stay, you know, lie, just lie as, as still as I could, which was impossible to expect a four year old to, to follow that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:38    So that's one of the things I remember. Um, I also remember the doctor coming into, 'cause I was put in my parents' bedroom, which was larger than my own during the day in. And just one of the images I have was this doctor would come and he would take the lampshade off a side bed, a side table lamp, and put it on my head as a hat. And he did that like three or four times. And then I didn't like it that much, but he kept doing it. He thought it was a funny joke. And, uh, so it's one of the things that have stuck with me. But, so that was not a stroke, it wasn't a mental thing, but it was an allergic reaction to my tonsils.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:32    So the next thing I'd like to ask is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? That's a very broad range of what we could mean by that. Um, but if you could, if you can  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:50    Yeah. Died of Alzheimer's.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:52    Okay.

Um, please tell me kind of what the issues or problems were and what you did to try to communicate with that person.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:04    Okay. Um, I, of course stood sort of second row to the problem. My father-in-law and my, my wife at the time were the most affected by it. And I remember trying to, to find things that she would be able to have a conversation about. Um, which as, as the illness progressed, it was, it became more and more difficult all the time. But I was the one trying, she was a music teacher, so I was trying to talk about music and kinds of music she liked.

Um, so there was a girl named Cinderella, and she got two new stepsisters and a stepmom. Um, and they were really mean to her. The stepsisters were very full of themselves in vain, and they didn't like her and neither did the stepmom. So she did all the work around the house, um, and she went with the animals and she swept and did everything. Um, and then she dreamed of going to the palace and like having a better life. Um, and one day the stepmom got an invitation to a ball at the castle. And, um, she was, well, the stepmom and the stepsisters were very excited and they began to get ready. And then she, um, Cinderella wanted to go as well, but they didn't want her to go. Um, and so she put on, she didn't have the best dress and then she put it on, and then they ruined it and, uh, pulled her necklace off and broke it and everything.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And then they all left to go to the ball and Cinderella was at home. Um, and she started crying. And then her very godmother appeared and, um, like told her that she could go until midnight. And then she had a carriage made out of a pumpkin, um, versus, and a nice dress and her hair was done and everything. Um, and so she went to the ball and everyone was like amazed at this beautiful person and they wanted to know who it was. And she danced with the prince. Um, but then she realized it was almost midnight, and so all of her stuff would turn back to normal. And so she went back outside and was running off and her glass slipper fell off. Um, and then when the prince was trying to follow her, but he couldn't catch up to her, but he found the glass slipper. And so she got back home, her stepsisters and mom came back home and they were all excited and they didn't know that she had went. Um, and then the next day the prince was going around trying to find someone that fit whose foot fit the, um, slipper, glass slipper. And finally she tried it on and it fit and they went off and got married and like,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:30    Excellent. Okay. And then last, um, for this first test, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:39    Okay. Um, so first you would need to wash your hands. Um, and then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread. Um, you take the tie, there's usually a twist tie on the bread. They take it off and open the pack. And if it's a brand new pack, you probably wanna throw away the first piece, the end piece. You probably don't wanna use that, but you grab two pieces of bread and you can put 'em on a plate or a napkin, um, separately. And then you go and grab a knife and, uh, the peanut butter and the jelly. And so first you're gonna choose either the peanut butter or the jelly, but let's just go with the peanut butter. Um, so you'll twist the top off of the peanut butter and stick the knife into it and get some peanut butter on the knife. And then you'll use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread. Um, and then you'll go, when you finish spreading the peanut butter, you'll go and wash the knife off, and then you'll open your jar of jelly. It's either, it's probably gonna be a twist top as well, so you're gonna twist it and use the knife and spread the jelly with the knife. Um, on the other piece of bread. \n"}, {"job_id": "E8OJzZ0YydgKR29e", "filename": "capilouto80a_1057361_1294808.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Cinderella because it's a classic.

And in fact, that her two daughters were equally unkind. They were very cruel. They insisted that Cinderella do her laundry, do their laundry, and bring them tea whenever they wanted. One day, uh, Cinderella was looking far, looking out the window at the, at the palace, at the, uh, palace, far, far away in the distance, the castle where the prince lived.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    And one day the family received a letter in the mail, an invitation because the king had become very concerned that he had not found a suitable wife for his son. And so he decided to give a ball, a big dance, and he would invite all the young women in the kingdom. And so he sent out his in invitations, and one arrived at the home of the widower and the stepmother and the three daughters. And the two older daughters were excited about this. We will go to the ball, maybe the, maybe the prince will choose one of us. And Cinderella was looking over their shoulder and she was also reading the invitation. And she thought, well, I could go to that too. And so we, she went up to her room and she looked in her trunk. She looked through all of her things and she found a dress, a pink and white dress that she thought probably would work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:58    And now the animals in this household were very sympathetic to Cinderella. And the two little mice were watching and they were cheering her on. So Cinderella put on her lovely pink and and white gown. And she went downstairs and to show the other, to show the stepmother. And the two stepsisters, when they saw her, they were irate and angry. And they said, you cannot go to the ball with us. You're just a Cinderella. You're just a little chamber, ma. And with that, they began to rip off the ribbons and the other fancy attire. And so Cinderella had to go back up to her room. And the stepmother. And the stepsisters, not only that, they locked her in her room so that there was no possibility of her leaving to go with them when they went off to the ball. And Cinderella sat in her room, weeping, suddenly do,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Do sparkling. Stardust fell upon the room. And there appeared the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said, why are you weeping Cinderella? It's because my evil stepsisters and my stepmother will not allow me to go to the ball. And I wanted so much to go and they tore apart my, apart my dress. And now I have nothing to wear. Oh, yes, you do, said the step, said the fairy godmother. And with that, she waved her magic wand and stardust fell all over the room. And suddenly Cinderella was clothed in the most beautiful white gown. And her hair was done up in a very fancy hairstyle with a hairband. And she was absolutely beautiful. And the little mice cheered and said how wonderful she looked.

And they gave her a hard time, bossed her over, made her do all the dirty work that around the house and such. And the Cinderella slipped in the attic upstairs, but she had the view out our window of the, uh, castle where the royal family lived and thought it would be nice if someday she could go and visit in that captive. So anyway, years went by and the family had received an invitation from the castle to a dance. So they were all excited about it. And, uh, on the night of the dance, why the two daughters, uh, Cinderella had gone in and gotten one of the dresses and put it on pretending like she was gonna go to the dance too. But the two daughters, when they saw her with that dress, they made her take it off and put her own shabby clothes back on. And then they all left for the castle and the dance.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:55    Meanwhile, Cinderella goes out in the garden in the backyard and sitting on a bench back there, what was all of a sudden appeared to her fairy godmother.

So the godmother said, well, we can do that. I'm going to furnish you with a coach and horses to pull it, and the coach itself will be in the form of a pumpkin. Now the only thing is you've got to be out of that castle and back here by 12 o'clock,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:52    And I'm going to see that you have a real nice dress and glass slippers and everything.

The, the coach where she got in, the coach and the, and the driver of the coach took her up to the castle and she got out and went in.

And, uh, uh, Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated. She basically had to do all the work that the other sisters didn't want to do. So she was, um, never, uh, so she was always been giving job, giving job, getting jobs to do, and never was able to do them to the liking of the evil stepmother.

So, um, the, yeah, meanwhile the other, uh, two, uh, stepsisters were, uh, were getting ready for the ball and basically, um, the, um, the, uh, were getting their dresses put together. And so, um, they were all prepared to go to the ball. And then, um, uh, on the day of, I believe, uh, Cinderella still wasn't ready. And, uh, so the, the birds and the mice and all that, all the other animals tried to help her put together something. And they were stealing. I remember they were stealing like, uh, the needles and buttons and things from the stepmother to, to put the dress together. And she was discovered, that was discovered in the mud stepmother basically gave her more jobs to do and made it so she couldn't go to the ball. And somewhere in the story, there's a fairy godmother comes into the picture. Yeah.

And so then, then she creates a, a, a, a nice, uh, gown to wear and, uh, uh, off she goes to the fall, but she has to be back by midnight 'cause the spell ends at midnight.

I have to go back a ways because I have never broken a bone in my body. So the only time I had to go to the hospital was when I was seven. I was playing, um, uh, you know, skip or something on the playground at elementary school and hopscotch, and I tripped. I'll never forget it. There was a twig that went from one section of a ground to another. My foot hit it just right and I plowed right into the, the bent that was along the brick of the, of the school. Do you know what I'm talking about, man? My head hit that and it sliced open my forehead right here. Oh my goodness gracious. And you know what? It didn't even hurt at all because they, I guess it was so sharp the blood started coming down. So I was, I was rushed to the hospital and they, they had to sew me up and believe it or not, uh, about a week afterwards I was kind of playing with it and I accidentally opened it back up again. Ho Oh, you know, so then they took me back to the emergency room and they did a butterfly thing. And after that it was, I was fine.

Uh, sometimes he lets me, sometimes not, and I'll just say, it's so good to see Nicholas not, you know, the only thing you can do is just really smile and, and, and keep him at, um, ease. 'cause he can get very upset. So, um, I can't say I do a whole lot for him because I don't know how to deal with autistic, uh, children, but it sure was good to see 'em when I see 'em.

Oh, Cinderella thought, I wonder how I would get to the ball.

Then out of nowhere, a beautiful good witch showed up and she granted Cinderella a wish. The wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city, that nothing would ever compare. She would also grant her a, a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince. The only exception was that she would have to be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin. Oh, this is so wonderful. Cinderella said, yes, I have to go.

I cannot finish my dance with the prince. So she hurly ran down the stairs, and as she ran down the stairs, one of her glass slippers fell off. The prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown. Minutes later, Cinderella turned back to her made outfit in her rags, and no riches anymore were on her. She went back to scrubbing the floors, mopping, wondering about her wish to become a princess one day. \n"}, {"job_id": "EpXJuqnU9WVTFZ13", "filename": "capilouto62a_802604_1039864.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    I'll never agree to that.

And, and, and so, um, uh, during that time, the, i, I started to change the, the, the tube. I couldn't get it in and it scared me to death. So I called a surgeon, which was a, a, a cousin of his to tell him that I couldn't get the tube back in.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    He said, go over to the hospital and, and let them do it. Well, I took all of the things that was sterilized and told the doctor at the hospital what to do. And, um, um, he couldn't do it. So he goes up to the fifth floor to get a surgeon and he comes down a little old fasty man with a mustache like <inaudible>. And, and, and he's, and he reaches over to, to get the pair of gloves off the wall. I says, no, you can't use those, those are not sterilized. He said, it wouldn't hurt him if I picked up something off of the floor and put it in his back. I said, lemme tell you right now. He's laying there because of your negligence. You're not about to put something in his back. And he looked back at me and the two nurses that standing there, she looked, they looked at me and, and, uh, he left outta the room and he, uh, he told the man to go get him some sterilized scissors.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    He turned around, looked at me sterilized. And, and, and so, uh, he took those scissors and he was going into his back and was gonna stretch that area to try to get that, uh, that open so he could get the tube in. I says, no, you're not either. You call his doctor right now. He's not about to be done that way. And, and so he left the room and, and he came back and he with a wheelchair and he said, I'm gonna take him up for x-ray. The doctor wants you to come in on Monday. This was on a Friday. And, uh, to have a have a, a scan done. And so, um, um, he wasn't very happy. The nurses says, what's wrong with you? And I told them about what had happened. And, and they said, aren't you afraid? I said, I'm scared to death, but he needs help. So, uh, they took him upstairs and the doctor had us go over there. We never saw that doctor again. Don't know what happened to him. I think he lost his job. I don't know. I'm sorry about that. But I wasn't about to let my husband go through another ordeal of their negligence. And, and, uh, so, uh, anyway, um, it wasn't about a month  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    That, um, um, after that I developed hepatitis and he had to stay and take care of me. I wasn't, I was put to bed. He had to wait on me. I couldn't even lift to cut. And if I had been clean, having to take care of his back, there was no way that I could, I wasn't able to. And so God's plans better than ours is. He gave, he healed his back, is the way I felt that the doctor said would never be, it'd be there the rest of his life, healed his back so he could take care of me. And then as soon as I went back to work, they told me I'd never work again. I went back to work because they said he would be better than, uh, if I, what was working. And, and so I went back to work. He developed cancer of a different kind in the other lung. And he, and he did the radiation treatment on that. And a month from the day that they finished the radiation, he. \n"}, {"job_id": "bJH8mL8zke5Uqxzw", "filename": "wright02a_1382051_1619303.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay.

I says, said, you director says you're married.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    She had a hard time convincing me of that. Uh, anyway, things progressed and we had a very short courtship.

And, uh, she came up, she would go to church with me on Sundays, and then after mass we would get together with four or five of the couples and the priests and go to the local joint and have dinner and this and that. And it's got to be kind of a habit. And she would drive up every Sunday, and then we would go back to the, to the lake and read the paper, whatever. And finally I proposed, I mean, she encouraged me. And, uh, so we decided it was sort of early June. Now, we didn't email knowing each other more than five weeks.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:01    And it was early, early June. And, and it was kind of a rainy day. And I said, well, let's take a ride and we'll go someplace nice. Neat. Well, we came down, we ended up at Mayville.

I just saw somebody in the kitchen. And they said, oh, that's, that's our stepdaughter or step sister. She doesn't, she, you don't even wanna see her. She's too ugly.

And he says, did, were you there the other night? She says, yes, it was me. I was sitting, I was dancing with you. He says, really? He says, okay, well, how come you're not in a nice outfit? And she says, well, my two step stepsisters and my stepmother,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    They keep me tied up here in the kitchen. And he says, what?

And the symptom was that I would get these purple rashes. Um, so the cure, ultimately the cure was to have a tonsil operation and have my tonsils removed. The process was a very long, in fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose the cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time they were trying to figure out what was wrong. And then I remember my family changing the physician, and then this physician who saw me for the first time says, we need to, we need to take out his tonsils right away. And so I was bedridden and I had to stay in bed. But the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to show that I could do it and contradict the doctor's orders. So that was my most traumatic, uh, bedridden experience other than, you know, flu two or three day flu or stomach virus. That was my major illness. And I was late going to kindergarten, so I always remember. But I spent some time trying to catch up with the rules and everything was the way it had been for about a month and I could not join them until a month later. So I was playing catch up in kindergarten.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:45    Uh, our next prompt, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating?

I was teaching Spanish, I'm very fluent in Spanish, and I was teaching Spanish at Salva Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island. And one of the students in my class would completely refuse to do anything. He would not answer questions, he would not, uh, respond, would not participate. He was excluding himself from the classroom, every class, every class. So eventually I said, okay, we, I have a problem here. I tried different things to, you know, ma making him the silent participant in, in plays or kids that we would put on in class. And even that meant met with very partial cooperation from him. So I called him to a meeting and then he told me a very long story of how his parents had spent so much money tutoring him or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through high school in math, in English, everything. And he had this aversion towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish the reason why he was not participating. He could have been just making it up, but I think he was, at least he made the effort of coming to the meeting to explain to me why he was not participating. And I took that as a positive move on his part. \n"}, {"job_id": "64YxpdJnrG3dL3nG", "filename": "UNH1018_1025730_1262870.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    I'll look at the pictures first.

So there once was a young girl named Cinderella. Um, she, uh, lived alone with her father, who one day married a evil stepmother, although she didn't know she was evil at the time. And along with the mother came two very nasty stepsisters. Now, the stepmother and stepsisters treated Cinderella very poorly. They made her do all the cleaning up, all the washing. Um, even though, uh, the family was fairly well off and could afford to hire servants, um, Cinderella's father was most often away. Um, so that left her alone to the mercy of her evil stepmother and stepsisters. Now, Cinderella grew close to the animals, uh, that her family owned the horses. The mice not technically owned by her family, but living in the house. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, uh, the birds of the forest and could, uh, get them to help her with the chores every now and then.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:06    Uh, one day Cinderella found out that her family was going to the prince's ball. She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it. She took her time and made her own dress, uh, to go with her family 'cause her stepmother and stepsisters would not allow her to be providable. And upon learning that, uh, she had planned to do this, her stepmother and her stepsisters, uh, tore the dress from her, tore, tore into it and made it unserviceable to go to the ball with. Now, after her stepsisters and stepmother had left to go to the ball, uh, a fairy godmother came to Cinderella and told her that she could help her get to the ball on time and charmed the handsome prince. And to do this, she transformed a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice, the horses, and the birds into appropriate helpers for Cinderella. She also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers. She, however, told Cinderella that Cinderella had to be backed by midnight or else the magic would wear off. Now, Cinderella went to the ball and had a fabulous time. She was noticed by everyone upon entering, including the prince. And the prince asked her to dance, choosing to dance with her over the two stepsisters, neither of whom recognized her somehow <laugh> <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:24    She enjoyed her dance with the Prince so much that she lost track of time. And just before it hit 11, she noticed, or just before it hit 12, she noticed that the time was about to be up. So she ran from him without an explanation. He chased after her down the steps of the palace. She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running. This Prince stopped and picked it up knowing that he could never catch up to her, as it were. She managed to just escape the castle before the magic wore off, leaving her back to looking by plain old cinder.

Well, the two daughters of the woman did not like the daughter of the husband of the man. In fact, they made her work in the cis cleaning up the house, cleaning up the ashes and the cinders in the chimney. And they eventually just called her Cinderella.

So I stopped at the church, picked her up, and she went with us. And we got to the hospital, which is like another world from where I live. And he, when I finally was allowed to see him, he was on a gurney and he was propped up and very un his eyes were open, but there was no response. It was very vacant. And I did all the things you think, like, squeeze my hand, blah, blah, blah, blah. He, he did nothing. There was no sign that he was there except that his eyes were open. And that was the beginning of a very, very long, you know, recovery. Um, but he was, he was paralyzed and couldn't speak and really just wasn't present. And we, we had this go on for several days in the I C U until he started improving. And he was in the hospital there two weeks, then in a rehab hospital for four weeks. And then he came home and he was able to walk at that point, uh, not well, but he could walk. And, um, went to outpatient therapy for a year and a half at, until the day they said, we don't think he can return to his job.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:34    And they said, given that you have private disability insurance, if he does a job trial, it might show that he can do a lesser job. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and that might not benefit you both financially. And that was, that day was the end of therapy. There was no easing into it. It was done. Goodbye. That's it. At which point I picked up the phone knowing that while he was physically probably where he was gonna be, knowing he had so much more to do with speech. And I called, started calling around and I'm a nurse. I know who to call. And I was amazed to find out that Indianapolis has no university based speech programs at that time anyway. And I eventually, I called different hospitals at the med center and they told me that all the speech was in Bloomington, which I should have known because my sister graduated from that program back when it was not rehab.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:41    It was all school, you know, therapy. And, um, I called down there and, and talked to the secretary. That answered, and that was the beginning of our relationship with, with the Bloomington Speech Clinic. And we traveled for 12 years. We drove to Bloomington every week, and he gained a lot from it. And we made a lot of wonderful friends between the therapists and the other clients we met. And that led to me eventually starting a program here in Indianapolis. And it's the only thing up here for that's a, a, uh, support group. And it's modeled after the program in Bloomington.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:28    Here's another series of pictures. When you are ready, please tell me this story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:33    All right.

Um, I, in 1983, I had a severe auto accident and, um, I had my children with me and one was in the front seat and one was in the back seat. And I, a car ran into me from the side at a fairly good rate of speed. And I don't remember much of the accident except that I heard the story so many times. My children, when the car came to a stop, I don't remember anything about the other driver or where they were, but I can almost visualize the moment that maybe I came to. And my oldest son was able, he was in the front seat, he was able to open the door and run for help. And I remember telling him this, I do remember, I remember saying, tell Richard I need call, call Richard and tell him I need, and so fortunately there was a home very close and he ran and used the phone and of course they called 9 1 1.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    So, um, my husband was on the opposite side of the city and hit the car and came flying all the way across. And the younger child was in the backseat and he, I don't remember looking at him, but he didn't seem to be hurt, the voice. And they, they weren't, the voice turned out to be okay. They had to, uh, cut me out of the car with the jaws of life and they were putting me in an ambulance just as my husband to be arrived. And, uh, he followed the ambulance and stayed then while they checked out the kids and took them to my mother's house and who was on the third side of the city. And she kept the boys, he came back to the hospital. By the time he came back, um, I think I was having tests run. I don't remember any of this part except for having a reaction to some I v p die and I have a flash of being in an elevator.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:05    Um, and I remember that I felt hot and sweaty. It's weird that I remember the reaction, but that's all. And I, I don't, I just remember hot and sweaty. It was a bad sensation. I was in the hospital for two weeks. I had pelvic fractures, ribs, concussion, and I would call my mother. I could remember her phone number and from the very beginning I would call her constantly and I'd say, hi, where am I? Hi, where am I? Bless her heart. She just, she'd answer the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we'd do it again. This went on a lot. But as the days went by, the concussion got a little bit better. And, um, I remember they took me to a whirlpool bath and using, uh, you know, a whole harness system to lower me into this tub. And I'm not sure it helped, but it felt good.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:01    Um, so I was released in the hospital after two weeks and, um, and my husband came by every evening and, and brought outside food because the hospital food was so terrible. So I went home and I was on crutches with no weightbearing all summer. So this was in about this time in June, about maybe June 23rd. And, uh, we had a wheelchair.

Once upon a time, there was a really, really nice man who sadly lost his wife and had a daughter named Cinderella. And he was pining over this woman who had two children of her own. She also had lost her spouse, and they decided they were gonna get married and join their family together. However, the stepmother and the stepsisters were not particularly fond of Cinderella because she was so beautiful and all of the animals loved her, and her father loved her, and everything she did was just sweet and kind and good. And they were very jealous. So they made her do all of the worst things. They made her do all of the cooking and all of the cleaning, and she didn't get to wear any nice clothes. But she was lucky because she had all the animals as her friends, and they encouraged her and were kind to her. And they noticed that she would look out at this castle and wonder what life would be like in the castle outside of the place she lived one day. Then the king of that castle wanted his son to meet women in hopes that he would become married. And he sent a notice across the village and everyone was very excited, including Cinderella. And so her stepsisters were starting to get all of their things together, what they were gonna wear and what they were gonna do. And Cinderella did the same.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    She found a book to help her make something, and the animals helped her make something. And then her stepsisters were again, so jealous and envious of how beautiful she was, that they ruined her dress. And Cinderella was very sad, and her fairy godmother appeared and turned everything into the most beautiful things ever. Her dress was prettier. She had a lovely carriage and horses to drive the carriage, and she went to the ball. When she got there, the prince wanted to dance with her because like everyone else, he noticed that she was the kindest, gentlest, most beautiful creature in the room. And so they danced and danced. And Cinderella noticed it was almost midnight, and her fairy godmother had told her that at the stroke of midnight, everything would turn back to normal, and that she needed to be out of the castle by then. So she ran out, but on the way she dropped her shoe, lost a shoe, she went home and was very, very sad. Sad. And they locked her in a room so she couldn't get out. But the mice noticed that the Princess Paige was bringing around a shoe to, to fit to all the women, and they snuck the keys under the door, and Cinderella got out and the shoe fit her, and she and the prince lived happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:27    I'd like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:33    Begin. Okay. If I were to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I would first get out all of my supplies. I would get out a cutting board, and I would put my two slices of bread on the cutting board. I would get probably a napkin, the peanut butter, the jelly, and a knife. \n"}, {"job_id": "Q7lU2PhSvfVV9P0g", "filename": "wright81a_715693_952731.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    No Cinderella in the time she was big.

There, there once was a, a mean woman who had two daughters and si then there was Cinderella whose mother and fa, whose mother passed away. And the father remarried the women with the two daughters. Cinderella was a good, happy young child and she enjoyed her life until the father remarried. When she was part of the new family, the her mother was very mean to her. Her new mother was very mean to her, and the two daughters were very mean to her. And she became more or less the scullery maid for the other family, for the new family. She had to do the dishes and clean the house and never had any new clothes. And the other daughters used to make fun of her and the mother. It was very wicked and very mean to her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:37    And she was like that until, for 10 years, until she grew up and she, they were still mean to her and doing everything bad to her. But one day the mother receives an invitation to go to the king's ball because the king and queen was getting angry with their son, the crown prince, and wanted to meet the people in the area because they wanted him to get married and they were gonna have a great big ball and invited the whole town. Everyone was invited except for Cinderella. And she would stay home and play with her animal friends and all their, her imaginary friends. And one day came to her, a fairy godmother, and she cried to her fair godmother. Everybody in the town and the hamlet were going to the ball except her. And she would love to go to the ball. And the fairy grandmother said to her, I would dress you and make you over, give you a great coach and do whatever I can to make you beautiful and you will go to the ball, but you would have to go to the ball, but make sure you are home by 12 o'clock, midnight or else everything that I've done for you would turn you back to the original state.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:35    So the, her sisters and her mother went to the ball and they were all dressed up and everything was fine with them.

Cinderella, uh, was a little girl whose dad, and, uh, I guess he lost his wife. And so he took, uh, on a, another woman. And she had two daughters and they were married. And, um, the two daughters treated, uh, Cinderella pretty bad. She was a stepmother, and so did the stepmother. Uh, it was kind of harsh with Cinderella. They made her do all the housework and, and those type things. Um, she was always left out and she didn't get any, the new clothes and the fancy food and go to a lot of the fancy places. Well, in the area they lived, um, the kingdom, there was a young prince and he was, uh, becoming a young man, and he was looking for his princess. So they decided they were gonna have this ball, and they would invite all, invite all the, uh, single young girls to this ball, and he would choose someone in from those that come to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:12    Well, of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, and she was kinda upset. She thought she would, wanted to go really bad. And, uh, so it just so happened that her fairy godmother appears and said, well, Cinderella, uh, if you would like to go, uh, we can, we can fix it. So you can go. So the, uh, fairy godmother, she dresses Cinderella up in a very fine gown and, uh, ball dress and tiara and everything. And she, uh, takes a pumpkin and turns it into a, uh, carriage, uh, beautiful carriage with horsemen and, and, uh, horses. And they go to the palace and go to the, uh, ball. And, uh, while they're there at the ball, of course, the princes out. Check in on all the young ladies and the two stepsisters kind of recognized Cinderella and, and kind of want to keep her in the background.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:17    But all of a sudden the prince happens to notice her and notice it, that they were trying to put her, put her off. And so he decides he's gonna take Cinderella and dance with her, and he does. And, uh, during the dance, he becomes enchanted with her and thinks, well, she's a fine young lady. This is, I think this is the gal I'd like to, uh, spend some more time with. Well, uh, somewhere along the way, uh, <affirmative>, um, Cinderella has glass slippers and, uh, her fairy godmother told her, now, at a certain time of the ball, you're gonna have to leave.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And so, uh, that time comes and Cinderella is getting ready to leave, and she runs out of the ballroom and down a flight of stairs and to her carriage. And as she does, she loses one of her slippers and she jumps in the carriage and they take her on back to the house. So she'll be there when the rest of the family gets back. And so, um, she's there and they come back and they're telling the story about the ball and everything, the fun they have and what went on. And I'm sure they mentioned this story about, well, she picked this girl and she lost her slipper. Well, the prince decides the next day that he, uh, wants to find this girl. So he sends one of his, uh, servants out, or one of his assistants out to the village to look for this girl who wore this glass slipper.

And I have learned to just kind of slow down and accept his pace of speech. And it actually has made me wonder if maybe he once was a stutterer and if this is his, his way of, of coping with stuttering. But I haven't asked him that.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:44    Alright. Now thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from any time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:02    Yes. Um, my grandmother was ill, um, and she didn't tell any of us, but she started losing weight and sleeping a lot. And she finally went in and got diagnosed with, um, bowel cancer. And it was very, um, confusing and scary for all of us because no one in my family had experience with terminal cancer. Um, and the doctor didn't give clear communication about what we should expect. And so initially we thought that her cancer could be cured with surgery, and later it was revealed that, you know, this was stage four cancer and there was no way it was going to get better.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:25    Um, and she very much wanted to stay at home. Um, and I wasn't living in, in my hometown anymore. So it was my mom that was really taking care of her and she could no longer take care of my grandmother. It was just overwhelming. She was having a lot of issues. So we brought her back to the hospital and she kept saying how much she wanted to go home. And mom and my brother, who, who was in medical school at the time said it, it just wasn't possible. We couldn't care for her. I was secretly hoping maybe we could take her home because for me there's something very sacred about being able to, to be in your space. So that didn't happen. She remained in the hospital and got progressively worse. And it happened over a period of weeks. And I remember visiting her in a hospital and there was light coming in the window and windows. And then she was transferred to another spot.

I had cellulitis, uh, about, I don't know, 10, 12 years ago. And, oh, you want me to talk about it? Okay. So yeah, I had cellulitis and I got very, uh, I thought I had a, like a stomach flu. My kids were sick and then I was feeling sick and I just figured we were all just sick. And I, um, my husband had to go out of town. He left on a Sunday night and I wasn't feeling great that morning. I got up and I felt awful. The kids were fine by that point, but by Monday morning I felt awful. Like to the point where I could, I remember feeding the kids breakfast.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:13    They had their cereal on the table. They were only three and five at the time. And I then just put my head on the kitchen table. I couldn't even lift it up. And I called my sister, uh, because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting vehemently and it just, and I had been for a long time. I knew something was not right and I, 'cause I actually had been sick for several days now that I think about it. Um, because I hadn't showered and I called the doctor. They said, yeah, you need to be seen. And, um, and I called my sister and she thought I wanted her to just stay with the kids. And I said, no, you have to take me. My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive 'cause I can't not throw up. And so she was like, whatever.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:01    Okay. So she came over and I remember wanting to clean myself because I, I hadn't showered for days. I thought, I can't go to the doctor. And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I went to, um, I was cleaning under my arm and there was this huge lump. I thought to myself, oh my God, I developed breast cancer, like overnight <laugh>. And, uh, but it was like noticeably enlarged. So I, I thought it was strange though, 'cause I was sick of my stomach. It didn't seem connected. So my sister took me and she right away understood when she saw me, how sick I was and, and that I kept, you know, having to throw up in the car on the way to the doctor. It was just so bad. I walked in and I, we had just moved to Indianapolis. I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first, that's who saw me. She looked at me and within 10 seconds  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    She said, I have never met you in my life. You are very, very sick. I can tell that. I was like, okay, yeah, let me lay down <laugh>. And I laid down on the table 'cause I couldn't even sit up. So, um, they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually cellulitis and that it had, you know, turned into this horrific infection. So they were quite concerned, um, about my condition. I had to get blood work right away, et cetera. And apparently they told my sister we, uh, she is severely, severely ill. And um, like if she probably should be hospitalized, she's very, very dehydrated. But we don't want to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're gonna see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever too. And, um, my husband came home 'cause he was so worried.

This is a story about the time when I was kicking a ball in our yard and it went into our neighbor's window. Our neighbor was a very intelligent young man by the name of Richard Jenkins, and Richard was a writer and also a professor of literature. So when I sent the ball crashing through his window, I thought he was going to be mad, and I was very reluctant to go fetch the ball. But eventually I did. And you said, look, I will let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me. And that is how I started writing. And I felt so much love with writing that ever since I have become a writer and I haven't been published. But I had a lot of writings that started with that incident that, um, Mr. Jenkins induced after I broke his window.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:49    Um, okay, so here is a series of pictures. Please take a look at all of them first, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:01    So this story is about my Aunt Charlotte, who was a very mean old lady. And I remember spending a night in her house because of the pandemic. Uh, we had to, to, uh, we were caught by a lockdown in her house. And I did not attend school, but I did go to a tutor's house because of course there were no schools. But one day I was getting ready to go to my tutor's home, who was doing supplementary work so that I wouldn't miss out on school that was canceled. And it was raining. It was raining very hard. So I asked my Aunt Charlotte for an umbrella, but she said, no, I'm not gonna let you use my umbrella. So then I had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realized two things. One, that I was getting wet, which was not comfortable.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:02    I did not like that. And the second one that I had a very good excuse to get ahold of the umbrella. So I went back to my Aunt Charlotte. I said, look, I could get ill. And who knows, I could get, I could catch coronavirus because of getting ill. So the only way to prevent this is by your lending me your umbrella. And so faced with this incredible threat, of course, even a mean old lady like Aunt Charlotte was, would not dare to deny me the umbrella. So she gave me the umbrella and I was able to walk to the tutor's house with the umbrella.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:44    Here's a picture. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:52    Alright, so I remember this instance.

I, of course, am yelling at him to get stand up and come back up the hill because I don't know why, because when I looked down and I saw that there was blood all over the snow by him. So I ran down and not realizing how bad it was, I, I picked him up and I just took him back to our car, at which point I looked, and he had a huge gap across his face where the sled had hit him. So my husband took my daughter home, and I got to rush my son to the children's emergency room.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    Um, they took us in right away because obviously he was spouting blood all over the place. And, um, we got to bypass all the people that were there for their runny noses and all the other things in the emergency room. We went right back in and saw an ER doctor immediately, and of course, they decided that, um, it was too serious for them to deal with. So they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face. However, there had been a car accident, um, somewhere else. So the plastic, it had to be a pediatric plastic surgeon because my son was only five. So the plastic surgeon was off somewhere else dealing with, um, people from the car accident. So we just had to sit and wait. So we waited and we waited, try entertaining a five-year-old in a hospital bed for, um, about eight hours while we waited.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    And, um, we played all kinds of video games. We looked at fish in a tank. We, I mean, he got to the point he'd stopped bleeding. So we were just walking around and, and of course we couldn't eat or drink anything. Well, he couldn't because they knew he was gonna be going into surgery. So I, of course, as his mom didn't eat or drink anything because I didn't want him to see me doing it. And finally they came, the plastic surgeon came in and they decided he needed to go into surgery. It was about 2:00 AM and um, we went into surgery with, um, the doctor, one nurse, and for some reason, me, I went into surgery with them. And, um, they got out this, this is all my son remembers, this huge long needle to, to needle and assize his face. And when they got the needle out, he of course starts screaming because it was a very long needle.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:39    And, um, I, for some reason, the doctor told me that I'm needed to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia. And so I held him down and they gave him the shot, and then I stood up. And since I hadn't eaten for eight, nine hours and I'm diabetic, um, I passed out on the floor of the operating room. And, um, then they had two patients to deal with. Um, and I, it was strange, but they just brought me some orange juice and, and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery.

And imagine I'm riding, driving down the mountain and it's lots of curves and like this, right? And he's behind me and knows that I need coffee, but for some reason thinks it's a good idea to hand me my coffee mug while I'm driving the motorbike and I'm not thinking because it's morning and I need coffee. And I go to grab the coffee mug and next thing we know the, of course the motorbike went, w wha wha and then boom, I go on the, I didn't hit my head or anything. I, I mean I had his helmet on.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:58    So, uh, but I did fall on my shoulder very hard and broke my collarbone.

And I said, I absolutely need to go to the hospital. Well get on the bike, I'll take you there. And I said, no thank you. I'm never getting on that thing again. So we tried to hit your ride and the only car that came along that would give me a ride was a truck full of Thai monks who can't sit next to a woman, even though this woman is injured.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:46    So I have to kind of sit in the front and away from this monk so that I don't touch him. And then it's, as I'm going down the mountain from side to side, I can feel it's getting more and more painful. So then they drop me off at a, i, I try to tell them, we get down to the bottom of the mountain and you could go to the right, to a sort of country hospital or go to the left and go to the big city hospital. And I was trying to tell them in Thai, please turn this, please turn this way. And telling them the name of the hospital, Chang Ma Rum Chang ma rum. And they didn't take me there. They took me to the country hospital. So I go to the country hospital and no one knows what to do with this foreigner. And I'm sitting there looking and I can see like morphine right there. I'm like, something, I need something, but no one is helping me. And all these people just keep walking around. And so I just got up and walked out to the highway and I caught a taxi and <laugh>, I, I caught a taxi to the other hospital in the, uh, which is a taxi. There  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Is a pickup truck. So you have to get into the back of the pickup truck. And, and the driver was a woman taxi driver, which was really strange 'cause it doesn't really happen all that much. And she was very kind and didn't even charge me because she knew that I was in pain. So then I go in the hospital and I go up to the counter and it's just the regular part of the hospital. I didn't go in the emergency 'cause I just wasn't thinking. I was just like, this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English, I've been in an accident, I am hurt. I need help now. And they hand me this form and tell me to fill it out. And I have a broken bone so I can't, so I'm like, <laugh>.

Once upon a time, there was a gentleman whose wife had died. He had one daughter whose, whose name was probably Cindy. And, um, this gentleman found another woman and decided to marry her. She had two daughters as well, who were a bit older. But when the mother and the stepmother and the two daughters saw this little girl, they said, oh, we don't want you with us. We're gonna call you. Send her, and we will let you sweep the cinders from the hearth. And we don't want you in our lives. Well, Cinderella was very sad about this. She went out to the barn where she talked with the horse and the dog, and there were some little mice, and she would go out there and talk with them when she was sad, and they all became friends.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    One day a letter arrived from the king. Now the king had a son, a handsome son, a prince who was in need of a wife. And so the king decided to give a ball and invite all the fair ladies of the land to come to this ball in hopes that the prince would look them all over and find one that he would like to have be his wife. So the mo, the stepmother and the daughters were thrilled when they got their invitation, yes, we will go one, one of you surely said the stepmother will be the one that the prince will choose. Well, Cinderella heard about this and she said, I can go too. And so she went up to her room in the attic and she opened her chest and she pulled out a gown that she had and she put it on. It was pink and white and very pretty. And she ran down to show it to this mo, the evil stepmother and the two sisters. And they said, huh, you cannot go to the ball. And they began ripping off the ribbons and the lace. And pretty soon the dress was in tatters. Cinderella ran back up to the room and she was in tears, and she cried my beautiful dress, I have nothing else that I can wear to this party.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:27    Suddenly the room was filled with light and there appeared someone she had never seen before. Who are you? She asked to the strange apparition. Why I'm your fairy godmother? Said the woman, my fairy godmother. Yes. And I am here to see to it that you too shall go to the ball. By this time, evil  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Stepmother had locked Cinderella in the room, but the little mice came and brought the key and managed to get the door open. And now here was Cinderella and her beautiful, beautiful Wai garment with her hair drunk, done up in the most beautiful hairstyle you could imagine with jewelry. It was gorgeous. She was gorgeous. And so she came down the stairs from her attic and she appeared downstairs in the living room. And then not only that, the fairy godmother saw to it that one of the pumpkins in the patch became a beautiful carriage. She did this by simply waving her wand and Cinderella said, oh, is this carriage for me? Yes. And the horse suddenly became six horses. \n"}, {"job_id": "BVJd5i82Cl5cXpHc", "filename": "wright21a_674893_911761.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Cinderella is a young girl living with her father, whose um, wife has died and he decides to remarry when he remarries.

And, uh, they told me to watch my diet, uh, not to smoke, which I hadn't for a couple days, so I just decided that was it.

It was very mild.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:45    Uh, and communication. I think the problem that I have most is with my son. Uh, we're not, uh, as close as I think either one of us want, want to be.

Uh, there isn't a lot that we talk about, a little bit about his work. Not too much about my life because I'm retired now. We both are avid baseball fans. So we do talk about that.

Um, caught me off guard and I'm having a hard time thinking, take your time. That's something Um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:15    Well, it's an ongoing affair after 25 years. Um, my husband's aphasia is moderate to severe and after having chemo six years ago, it's even worse. It actually had improved and uh, the chemo really made a difference. Excuse me. So, um, I have, and you'd think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget. And one of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left, in fact, he's still gone to the hardware store and I'm, I, things I would've not done before I make a list of what he was going for because he might forget. And then he has to explain to the people there, although he has had so much therapy that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants. And it's very rare there's a failure there.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    He draws a lot of little tiny pictures. But I've learned that to be sure I, it's hard to remember to verify all the time. And he doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend and maybe he thinks he comprehends. So how do you discern between those two things? That's quite difficult, Kim. Does he think he understands perfectly or does he not understand and doesn't really wanna say he doesn't understand? So things like that make it very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him, you can take it to the bank. He, uh, totally understands if he sees it written. Uh, I know not to ask him, um, numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. Um, I did find out in the last week that he can repeat thanks to you. And that is something he has never been able to repeat.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:16    Not even one word. And now he seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he can tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask him to repeat a word. Um, it's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability that's, I I've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man because women are more, other women are more caring, more empathetic, less frightened. And I think men are not in general. So there is this learning curve for men. They, they, they have this discomfort and so it's just easier to avoid. Um, and I always feel badly for him because he is left out a lot. And I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter to explain to people what's wrong and please don't interrupt and, um, please turn the TV off.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:18    Or please turn the radio off, or, um, you don't have to shout. Although I don't find that so much. Um, but some people do. Um, people are not comfortable with disabilities. They don't understand. And even if they understand them at first, they feel awkward 'cause they don't know if it's sensitive and it's gonna upset you to talk about it. And I always tell him, yeah, we've been doing this for 25 years, we're not gonna get upset about it.

And Cinderella ended up in this home with two stepsisters. And they were unpleasant to her because she always seemed to make everything look happy and bright. Even animals cheered up when they were around her because she just let off this gift of light and love. And, and the sisters were very jealous, and the stepmother was very jealous also. So they mistreated Cinderella and had her do terrible things, uh, that none of them wanted to do. So Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in. And the castle there was a, a family obviously who lived there and the prince, um, was looking to find love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all, everyone in the entire village come to this ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:22    So Cinderella's stepsisters, um, got all of their, you know, their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things. And Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball. And since her stepmother and her stepsisters didn't help her, all of the animals did. So the, the animals who loved Cinderella, because she was so good, put together a beautiful gown for her. And just as Cinderella thought she was gonna get out of the house, um, her stepsisters and her stepmother ruined her gown. And she was very, very sad. And the stepsisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with, you know, ripped up dress and, and nothing to do. So this fairy godmother showed up and said, Cinderella, you are such a nice person. You're such a good person, and you have so much love to give and you so much light. I really want you to go to the ball. So I'm going to create a horse and carriage and a new outfit for you, and it's gonna be so lovely. But it ends at midnight, so you have to make sure you come home before then. So Cinderella goes to the ball. And her stepsisters were not pleased because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in because she was just so beautiful. And the prince, of course, noticed her beauty and grace  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    And again, this kind of calm, light, soothing to people that she let off. And he danced with her. And just then she realized it was almost midnight. And so she ran out, she lost one of her shoes and she didn't even make it home when everything went past the way that it was. And then one of the people who worked at the castle came around with the slipper that was found at the ball and tried it on every woman in town, and it fits Cinderella. And Cinderella found her Prince, or the prince found her by her dainty little glass shoe.

Uh, Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed about three months after I retired in 2011. I had symptoms before then, but didn't connect the dots. I had night sweats. I was tired and you just didn't think much of it. But then I noticed that I was losing weight and that's what caused me to seek a doctor. So I went to, I hadn't been to a doctor in years. Uh, so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now both our physician for both of us. She did a, an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram 'cause she palpated and she felt something, uh, but lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram, and that was positive enough for me to have a CAT scan and a PET scan that led to the need for a biopsy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    So at that, by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong. Uh, the decision was gonna be, is it, it, it was lymphoma, but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma? So I went to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy, but that wasn't enough. Uh, not enough tissue was obtained. So I had to go into the city, into New York to Sloan for, uh, a more complete biopsy. And that clinched it. It was Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two. Hodgkin's is much more treatable, uh, higher success rate. So I started chemo and, uh, after the first session, I developed a rash and we weren't quite sure what was going on. One of the nurses, the, the oncologist wasn't sure, and he was gonna proceed with the treatment for the, for the Hodgkin's. But one of his nurses said, this is an allergic reaction. And it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol. I think I mentioned this last time, um, which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout, but it has the protective effect, uh, for kidney function. That landed me in the hospital with, with what's called Steven Johnson Syndrome, which is treated like a burn. People with Stevens Johnson are often center  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    To units. My mouth was inflamed, but it was just off. I couldn't drink water. It just, it burned that, of course, suspended chemo. Uh, we worked through the Stevens Johnson. I was looking forward to chemo. It was, it was so bad that the chemotherapy was gonna be the vacation. Uh, so, um, and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather. But still, I, I couldn't take solid food for, for two weeks or so, nor water. It was, it was, the only thing that really worked was, was, um, uh, iced tea. Um, so I got through this. Stevens Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months. It ended last May. \n"}, {"job_id": "4BHl9mpTU9hkadAl", "filename": "NEURAL20-2_407248_643905.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    I think I may have mentioned to you that one of his therapists made a picture book for him, and that should have worked.

And in fact, that was the year when we had the blizzard of 1978 and we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon, on this day in February, when my husband came home from work where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church, he said, Carla, come in the house. I want to tell you something. I wanna ask you something. So I said, okay. So I followed him in taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He said, sit down for a minute. So I said, okay, I'm sitting. What do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years? Kenya? I said, where's Kenya? He said, it's on the equator where it's hot. No snow, <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    I said, count me in, let's go. And so we did, uh, he had received an invitation to come and work with the National Christian Council of Kenya in a family life education program where he would be responsible for setting up a counseling center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in community health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it. And so four months later we had sold our house, our car, most of our household possessions, with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend and our family of four. My husband Ted, our two daughters, Michelle, age nine, and Cindy aged five. And I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, Pennsylvania because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran in background, and he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite mission program. Well, who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to a 10 day orientation period in, in the heart of Mennonite country in Akron, Pennsylvania, where we spent 10 marvelous days getting to know, um, the Mennonites, and also a group of other people who were about to embark on Mennonites sponsored mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three year period of high adventure for our family, one of the best times in our lives.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:33    Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see from, with the beginning, a middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:42    Well, in the beginning, a little boy is outside playing with his soccer ball.

And I said, no, I'm not, because I didn't even, you know, there wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and whatnot. And so I kept saying, no, no, no, no, no. And she said, yeah, you're having a baby today. So, uh, and that was really like late afternoon when that happened. And by about six o'clock, I think it was, I, I started feeling more stuff happening. And still I didn't think we needed, there was any big deal. I, you know, it wasn't like enough. And I think we must have arrived at the hospital by, um, by, by seven 30 ish.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    It was like, okay, yeah, this is real. It's, it is time. And so on the way to the hospital and my husband, I think this was my first child, and get him kind of confused <laugh>. Anyway, he is of course, you know, like, oh my gosh, you're gonna have make me do that right now. And, and, uh, and so of course I was having contractions in the car, <laugh> at one point he was speeding, like he was speeding and, and he barely would stop for the lights. And we all continued to laugh because my words were, I, I yelled at him to slow down and said, it's not about you, it's about me, <laugh>.

I, boy, what kind of a mom am I, I don't even remember somewhere after 1130, because I remember when she was born then that, um, I was thinking about what date it was. It was the 14th, and that somebody had hoped that if I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday. And I had, you know, missed that window. Um, but anyway, uh, so it, you know, of course that's incredible when you hold your first child in your arms for the first time. But I was exceedingly grateful that it was a relatively quick delivery. And, and, you know, that's not to say it didn't hurt Ashley. That's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a, um, you know, a great experience all in all. And, and then we had our first baby. Wild. Now she's 20.

All his books get wet in his backpack. He gets home and his mom is less than pleased with him because he's dragged his, his wet shoes and self into the house, and she's looking very sternly at him.

This is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood, and the cat also got startled because of this dog. And so it climbed up the tree. Now this little girl's riding her, her tricycle and sees this cute little cat, and so she's trying to coax it down from the tree.

So she, there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk, and the only thing I can think that is, is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instructions.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom, and makes, with the help of the mice, they make a dress and she gets ready the night of the ball to go and is told that this was not for her. She's not allowed to go. And as I recall, they rip her dress to shreds and they go onto the ball and she kind of goes back to her little lofty place. Uh, the next thing we see is we've got the mice and animals around being empathetic, and then her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother whips her up a beautiful white gown in a pumpkin carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, but something scared the horses. And that was before this. So anyway, the pumpkin carriage is all good. She gets in the carriage, the fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight or it all goes away.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    So she goes to the ball. The stepmother and sisters are abhorred to see her, and, um, not happy at all. And the prince is enchanted and they spend the evening dancing. And all of a sudden she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight, and she takes off running and going down the stairs. She loses one of the glass slippers provided by the, the fairy godmother. And the prince finds it, and she gets home and, um, she looks, she's sitting with the animals, looking at the glass slipper with good memories. So now the prince still has a glass slipper and he sends everyone out looking for the, the girl with the glass, other glass slipper. And what they hear about this, the stepmother and the stepsisters, um, they realize it was her, and they don't want him to know. So they lock her in her room. However, the little animals, the mice especially bring a key to get her to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper. And that is what happens. She goes downstairs, tries on the glass slipper, the prince realizes he's found his bride, and that's about the end of the stepmother and stepsisters. And the last we see is they're, they're getting married, living happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:30    Beautifully. I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:36    Okay. The best peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made with white bread. Totally unhealthy, but it's so good. Um, so you need two pieces of white bread and a knife and a plate, and you need peanut butter. I didn't mention this before, but it's much better, but it doesn't have sugar in it. \n"}, {"job_id": "7lbIRLCgiIt52qBw", "filename": "NEURAL6-2_1782983_2019549.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, and of course she was pretty upset by that. Uh, the stepsisters were decked out in all their fancy regalia, and the stepmother was beautifully dressed herself, and they took the family's coach and left to go to the mall, leaving Cinderella behind in the fire, near the fireplace, um, crying. Well, as she was crying, something happened and she looked around and there was a very sweet, older lady standing there. And Cinderella, of course, was kind of surprised to see this, by the way, I'm not clear at all where the father was during all this. He apparently traveled a lot, and so he was gone. Um, the, uh, so anyway, the, the, uh, woman introduced herself to Cinderella, telling her that she was her fairy godmother, and she was there to grant her wishes. Well, Cinderella was taken aback, quite, quite thrilled at this whole possibility. And so the fairy godmother said, you we'll go to the ball. And she, I think the very first thing she did was to, to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella and her beautiful hairdo and lovely, uh, tiara type thing to put in her hair and beautiful slippers to put on her feet, which were very unusually made out of glass.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:44    But Cinderella said, how can I get to the ball? The carriage is gone. I can't walk, uh, especially not in glass slippers. And so the fairy godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin, created, uh, a Coachman and, uh, other servants out of the mice, and I think made the rats into horses. So anyway, there they were all set, ready to go to the ball. So she left Cinderella, left in her, all her finery, and went to the ball, walked in, and the whole place came to a hush. Everybody's looking at her and thinking, who is that beautiful young woman? And of course, guess who was the most impressed was the prince. So he immediately asked her to dance. And after they had one dance, he was really not interested in anybody else. So they had a lovely time. Suddenly those Cinderella remembered the most important, that godmother  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Stroke of midnight. She had to leave the ball because if by the end of 12 bell strikes, she was still there, everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were brilliants. So she, uh, she was remembering that and thinking, oh, I really have to be careful. But she was so carried away by this lovely time that she was having with the prince, and he was so, uh, falling so much in love with her. That time went on really fast and all of a sudden, bang, she started to hear, she heard the first, uh, stroke of midnight. So she ran. She said, I have to go, ran out of the palace. And, uh, the prince ran after her. And the prince's, uh, fancy servant ran after her. She's running down the, uh, steps of the power. \n"}, {"job_id": "ZR6VT8Vp5jpW9y7Y", "filename": "richardson21_1909029_2145588.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And she says, oh Prince, you came for me and kisses him probably again.

So Little Red Riding Hood, little Red Riding Hood.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    So Little Red Riding Hood's. This little Bratt who always wears a red hood, I think. 'cause she thinks it looks cool. I did the same thing when I had like come maybe sixth or seventh birthday. I don't remember. I got flippers and goggles and a snorkel and I literally never took them off even to sleep. I had the worst blood cramps. It was bad. But anyway, I think Little Red Riding Hood's doing the same thing and she's gotten a reputation for wearing it. So she's called Little Red Riding Hood and one day, I mean, she lives with her mom. I don't know where the dad is. He probably ran out on her, but  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:43    Probably 'cause she wears that red hood all the time. I think that's the source of all her problems.

But he doesn't actually want any fatherly responsibilities. But he comes up and he says, Hey, snow white. Snow White. Oof. Red Riding Hood. And your mother, I was just out at your grandma's cottage and she is kind of sick. Like, you should probably go see her before she dies. That's not true. You didn't say that. Maybe it was implied. Then again, why would you leave your grandmother in a cottage all on her own? That doesn't make sense. She's probably okay. She just has a cold. She's not turned late though. Good. So that is what the caught the, the, the wood cutter says. It says Your grandma is caught a cold because she went dancing naked in the rain and then didn't take care of herself. And so Little Red Riding Hood says, mom, I love dancing Naked in the rain. \n"}, {"job_id": "N8cxiRasIuq6Damr", "filename": "NEURAL19-1_1147223_1383694.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, so Cinderella was a maid in the home of a woman. And her two daughters, Cinderella was very beautiful, but the women and her daughters whom she served were ugly. Um, Cinderella did things like serving tea, and the women whom she served were not very appreciative. They were pretty snarky. Um, she would sit by her window and from her room, she had a direct view to the castle in the distance, and she often dreamed of a better life. She had a mystical way with animals, and although she was lonely, she had friends who were the animals in the barn. And also, um, some mice and some birds, blue birds specifically. Uh, one day a proclamation came and the prince was having a ball, and the woman and her two daughters were invited, and Cinderella got very excited and dreamed of the possibility of going, but of course, she was not on the invitation list, nor did she have the right clothes. So these magical mice got together and they showed Cinderella a special magic chest where wishes come true. And she wished for a gown, and a gown was made, and a necklace so that actually she could go to the ball. But one of these young women ripped the necklace from her, and she was very discouraged. She felt that she couldn't attend, and the mice intervened again and brought her a wise old fairy godmother. And the godmother said, I will make you  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    A beautiful gown and slippers and a pumpkin coach so that you can attend the ball, but there's only one stipulation. The, the, the spell will only last until the stroke of midnight. So you, you must be back before the stroke of midnight, or the illusion will, um, be broken. So she went to the ball and she danced with the prince, and they had a wonderful time, but she looked up and noticed it was almost midnight, so she quickly ran away. But in the process of exiting, she left her, her glass slipper behind, but she managed to make it home with one slipper just as the pumpkin coach was turning back into a pumpkin.

She'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the, uh, two main sisters. There was a prince. We lived in a castle and rode a white horse. Cinderella was always mopping, mopping, cleaning, you know, cooking, doing all the things, scrubbing on the floor with her hands and knees. Cinderella received a delivery. It was sealed, and the delivery went to the stepmother. Stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody, read it out to the sisters and to Cinderella. Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited, but as it turned out, she was not. So the stepmother denied her that, and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the ball. They were invited to a ball. The prince was having a ball. Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the ball. In fact, she tried on or looked at a dress that she would like to wear. She were going to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:55    She mentioned the dress, and then she looked at pictures of the dress.

She didn't know this was happening. She glanced at the castle and probably heard the music. The birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special surprise for her. She was so delighted with the dress. Meanwhile, the stepmother and the two sisters were, uh, prancing off to the ball and Cinderella was left back very forough and depressed with her dress and shreds.

Um, and in the same kingdom there was a prince who was unmarried. And the king thought the prince ought to get, uh, married and find a beautiful, uh, bride. So he decided to throw a big party, a ball and send out word throughout the kingdom that, uh, there would be this ball and a princess chosen for the, um, prince. Well, the two, um, ugly stepsisters on pleasant stepsisters decided they should go to the ball and, uh, uh, bickered a little bit among themselves, but, uh, found clothes and, uh, the, uh, stepmother dressed them and made sure that they looked properly and they went off, uh, to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:34    Uh, the Cinderella, who was the, the younger one, wanted to go to, but the stepmother said, no, no, no, it's not appropriate.

Gotcha. <laugh>. You're hilarious. Okay, so now I would like for you to tell me as much the story of Snow White as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:24    Okay. So once upon a time, there was a princess and her name was Snow White. And her name was Snow White because her skin was as white as snow. Her hair was as dark as like a raven's feathers or something like that. And her lips were as red as a rose. She was beautiful. I don't know how she has a stepmother, assuming she had parents. And then her mother died and then her father died and then he, or sorry, mother died. Father remarried, then father died. 'cause he would hope that he would step in. So now what was reduced to doing chores, what like other premises of fairytales. And while she did this, she was contented with her dream Prince didn't get out of the castle very much, and there's this really famous scene where she's singing over wishing well, and her voice is echoing back to her. So she says, I am wishing. And then it goes back and she's basically saying that one day she'll get saved from this by a prince.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:52    So the stepmother was not very happy that Snow White was as beautiful as she was because she was used to being the Ferris Noland. And she has a mirror that when she asks mirror a mirror on the wall, who's the Ferris of the mall, the mirror responds that she is the Ferris of the mall, usually in Ryan, um, that there are none as beautiful as she. And one day when the Queen, who has very low self-esteem asked the mirror who the Ferris in the land was, the mirror responded. That's pretty fickle mirror. That's no why. It was in fact the Ferris in the mall mom.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:39    So having not to be vested by snow white's good looks, their stepmother set orders a Huntsman to take snow white into the forest and to kill her <laugh>. It's pretty messed up <laugh>. And you could have just maimed her <laugh>, right? Like acid or something. <laugh>. But so the hunter takes snow white into the forest. And in the version that I know, snow White figures out that she's in trouble and she runs away from the hunter when he tries to kill her. And that's how she gets away. Um, and while she's running into the forest, she gets lost, um, in the wood. And, um, she comes upon a, a house in a clearing. Um, she gets to the house and she realizes that everything is small and that it's filthy. So doing what she does best chores, she gets right to work with her animal friends.

A man, the man has one child, and, uh, uh, and she's a girl. And the woman has two children, and they're both girls. So there's, they come together. The man's very much in love with a woman. They come together and they get married. And it's, uh, a family situation where the, the stepchildren in this case do not, are jealous of, of the attention. And, uh, and they don't get along as, as a total family. So they, they get together.

And she gets the, and the one condition that the, the fairy godmother gave her, I forgot to mention this, the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    One condition Ragga the mother gave her on going to the ball with, see, she had a, at this strike at 12, she had to be home at midnight 'cause she would turn it into a pumpkin, so to speak, mid midnight. So she goes to the ball and she has a great time, and, and suddenly she looks, she's dancing with a prince and he's enamored with her, and he spends all the time with her. And she looks at the clock, and it's a couple of minutes to 12, she has to leave, and she runs outta there.

That one really wasn't very exciting. Then we went from there to Assisi, which is St. Francis of Assisi, which a lot of people have heard of St. Francis. But, uh, we gotta go, uh, to the, um, cathedral Basilica, uh, where he, he got a vision from God that said, rebuild my church.

Interesting thing was they had been having earthquakes there, so there were lots of, uh, I, I'm not an artist, so lots of wall paintings that had big cracks in them and they were starting to the repair work on it. And then the last part of that in Assisi, we went to where Francis was a monk and where his community was. Uh, and they had a, a real neat thing. And in fact we were a group of Americans, American. And there was one guy from Ireland that came and talked to us and he could talk to us in English. None of the other guy, you know, everybody else was Italian.

Then he had three more months of physical outpatient physical therapy until that ended in November, September, October, and November After  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    That, we were able to get him signed up at Neuro Hope for the physical therapy part. Are you familiar with Neuro Hope? Neuro Hope is an amazing place. It's um, just very quickly it was started by a man named Chris Lou. Chris Lou sustained a severe neck injury and became quadriplegic approximately eight years ago. He went to a physical therapy place in Utah and he was able to regain a surprising amount of, of return of function. And after that, he and his family said, we must help other people who need continued therapy even though their, their insurance money has run out. So he did that and Ted has continued to be a patient at Neuro Hope, except that now that, uh, we, now that we have the quarantine twice a week, we have home exercises via Zoom. \n"}, {"job_id": "Te6hPr1qRlghfP1l", "filename": "NEURAL38-2_1905677_2141980.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, I saw a couple things I didn't see last time. Um, once upon a time, an evil stepmother with evil daughters, uh, is presented with a beautiful, nice daughter by a gentleman with a really bizarre looking tie. Uh, the evil stepmother has a nasty cat, and, uh, the nice stepdaughter has a goofy bud friendly dog. Uh, soon the king tells his son the prince, that he has to have a bride to be a princess because that's the way it works in, uh, in evil monarchies. And the king is so annoying that the prince will probably kick him out of the house, or he will be become king and has to have a, a princess who will become queen. So the declaration is made throughout the land. Uh, Cinderella, a nice, finds a book in a chest in the attic, which has absolutely nothing to do with the story, but she also finds a dress that would be great to wear. She puts on the dress and her evil stepsisters laugh at her because like, she's not gonna go to the she the ball because she is nobody. I think I've missed a couple pages with odd looking animals, but this is the main part of the story. Um, Cinderella is sad. She can't go to the ball, but fairy godmother appears and godmother presents her with a carriage with goofy looking horses. That's a pretty goofy looking carriage too, and helps her get dressed and she goes to the ball at the ball. The prince is dancing with all the eligible women at the ball. And eligibility includes being between 16 and 20 years old, being, uh, uh, high class and having  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The right greed, religion, race and financial status. And, uh, many dances with Cinderella. She's wonderful and somehow else she knows how to do these dances and he likes dancing with her, but suddenly she realizes it's almost midnight and she has to go, or her weird looking carriage will turn into a pumpkin. And pumpkins don't travel on old unpaved roads very well at all. So she gets going, and pretty soon it does happen. The carriage turns into a pumpkin and the horses sit on their butts and won't go any further. But somehow she does manage to make it. \n"}, {"job_id": "VPHKHNa2iIfKJrqq", "filename": "NEURAL11-1_34938_271230.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So luckily I haven't had any injuries or significant illnesses, but the first time I did have to go into the hospital was when I had my son and at that time I had to have a cesarean suction. So pretty common surgery. But I guess the scariest thing was they gave me the epidural and afterwards being paralyzed from the waist down was quite an interesting feeling, I should say. And my son had to go into a special care nursery, so he wasn't in my room with me and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the special care nursery so that I could nurse him. So that was a rather scary kind of feeling when, and I guess because I've worked with people with stroke and other neurological disorders, it kind of gave me at least a little bit of a, an inkling of what they go through and how they feel not being able to have some motor control. So luckily that only lasted for a few hours and, and then it wore off. But that was actually the first time I ever had to go into the hospital when I was in my thirties giving birth to my son.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:09    Um, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating before?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:16    Yes.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:18    Um, tell me what the problems were and a little bit about what you did about it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    Okay. Well, I am the associate director of the Aphasia lab at the University of South Carolina. So I work with people with aphasia every day and have been a speech pathologist for over 30 years. So I guess you could say I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last 30 years of, of my working life. And what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people who are cognitively intact but yet are not able to express themselves. So I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in, in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So have just always been really interested in ways to improve. And of course for the last four years is when I've been at the aphasia lab. So we focused on aphasia and being able to, number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:24    But also I teach the adult language disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well. And finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication. Uh, supported conversation with family members and just trying to improve in general people's ability to communicate no matter what their verbal communication is like and no matter what their cognitive skills are, either. I have done research both with people with stroke, but also with brain injuries. So I've worked with people with lots of different levels of cog, cognitive and um, language disorders. So just I guess maximizing as much as we can, ways for people to express themselves.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:10    Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life. It could be happy, it could be sad, it could be from when you were a child. It could be from more recently.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:24    Um, I guess it could be. So I have two children and one of my, um, children is adopted and one is not. So I already told the story about my son being born, so I guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption. We tried to have children for many years and couldn't get pregnant, and we went through lots of fertility treatments and didn't, they didn't really find anything that would cause us not to get pregnant.

So, um, Cinderella had two, has two stepsisters. Um, and I'm not sure if her father is a prince or prominent person, but, um, uh, the stepsisters get favored, um, all the time by the stepmother. And Cinderella in effect, has to serve them, wait on them, clean the house, do all the heavy lifting while the two sisters don't have to do anything. And then they get invited to a ball, uh, a dancing ball. And, um, they're all excited. And it looks like Cinderella had a dress to wear, um, and was planning on going to the ball. But it looks like they took the ribbon off of her dress, which I don't remember. Um, I thought she didn't have anything that she wasn't expected to go. But, um, from the book, it looked like they gave, she had found something to wear. Uh, but anyway, so the stepsisters went without her thinking Cinderella was not going to go. And then, um, a fairy godmother came and helped Cinderella with a beautiful dress and a fantastic carriage that she turned into from a pumpkin and mice that turned into horses. And, um, she goes in this grand style to the ball, and of course, the prince likes her the best and dances with her the most.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    And then she's gotta leave suddenly at noon. Uh, <laugh> midnight because her fairy godmother said, you can have all this, but it's only good until midnight, and then be home by then. Or, because everything is going to go away. The horses turned back. Mice, the carriage turns into a pumpkin, and you are going to have your regular clothes on. So she leaves at midnight and the prince is heartbroken. And in the course of her running away to make it by midnight, she drops one of her glass slippers and, uh, the prince gets it. And, um, so then the prince has his men search high and low for every woman that who can <laugh> try this glass slipper on. And, uh, that's how he finds her. So it only fits her foot. So she tries it on, and then the prince has identified her and they get married and they live happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:09    For your first task, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:16    <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:17    And you may begin.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:20    Okay.

I'm assuming you're making one sandwich and you find the peanut butter, you untwist the lid.

Off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes. It was a very bumpy road with lots of rocks when they hit one particularly large rock. A little girl rat with her baby, with her stuffed animal, flew right out of the back of the truck.

'cause they both had, uh, health problems, which affected their authority to communicate. The one I really didn't talk about was my mother for the last oh, two or three years that she was alive was <laugh> getting focus, was getting, um, dementia, mild dementia, certainly not Alzheimer's, but uh, her short-term memory was really starting to go. So I call her on the phone once a, not once a month or sometimes more if there was, uh, an anniversaries and birthdays and things like that. Or we were planning to come to Philadelphia and this started while she was still living at the house I grew up in, in Elkins Park on north side of Philadelphia area. And, uh, I would talk to her on the phone and say, me and Gina are coming in May, we're gonna New Jersey and then we'll be in Philadelphia and oh, we know how long you're gonna be here visiting my brother, and we'll visit you for a few days.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:13    And, and, uh, then we might go see my cousin and, oh, that's nice.

And when gonna come visit? I'm like, uh, about two weeks, <laugh> Memorial Day. And it would be really frustrating. But after I got kind of used to it, I had just try not to lose my patience and just, just tell the story again, third time or fourth time. And, and it was just really short term because she'd remember other things. Going back to going back to the 1920s, I think she'd, when she was born, she had a very good memory for a lot of things, especially for people in the family that were unpleasant to her 50 years ago.

We're in this, the back of this gas station convenience store, and he's on the floor and his eyes are open, but he keeps wanting to close them and he can't seem to talk. And I  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:38    Realized right away he had had a stroke just because I'm a nurse. And I said to him, is he breathing? And he said, yes. And I said, do you know how to do C P R? And he said, no. Um, I said, well, here's what I want you to do. I want you to first call 9 1 1 and tell them to get there. And when they do, call me back. I said, and in the meantime, I want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do C P R in case we need it. So he did that, and he came back and he says, well, one guy says he saw it done on tv. I'm going, well, it's not real helpful, but okay. He says, but I can hear the sirens right now. And I said, that's good, that's good.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:18    I said, okay, I'll stay on with you when, when they get there, let me talk to them and I'll tell them what's happening and what he's taken and what his history is. So anyway, long story short, they took him to a hospital on the south side of Indianapolis. I jumped into my car with an 11 year old and a, this is so old. I had a bag phone. Okay. This is 1996. Even that was not something everyone had. I had it because of the business that I needed to be able to be reached because we had these two stores.

And the fairy godmother says, oh, I see that you still have these rags on your feet. I'm going to turn them into beautiful glass slippers. This is an important plot device for later. So I'm pointing it out now. So Cinderella is all set to go to this ball, and she's practically unrecognizable. Not really, but just to her. You know, everybody because nobody actually cares about her in her life. So she's unrecognizable at this point because she's happy and beautiful. And the fairy godmother says, Cinderella, you gotta get out of this ball before midnight because at that point everything's gonna go to crap. So you don't want that to happen in front of the prince. You wanna make a good impression on this guy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:54    And so Cinderella says, yeah, whatever. Bye. And goes off to the ball drawn by her mice and dog in a pumpkin, and they get to the ball and she enters the grand entrance area, foyer. Boy, I don't know. Um, she enters and all of a sudden the prince is struck by her radiant beauty and they dance. They danced all night, and it's all very romantical. And I don't think the prince asks her name, which is sketchy because you should generally not dance the night away with a guy you don't know the name of, just a general rule, but I'm willing to let her have a pass on this because she was raised by heathens.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    So she's having a great time dancing with the prince. Nobody recognizes her, and all of a sudden the clock starts striking midnight. And so she books it. She is trying to get to her carriage and get home before everything goes to crap, because very godmother actually had some fair points there. And so she's running down the steps in heels, which is very, very hard. Like I, I sympathize and she loses a heel, which is fair, and she thinks about going back for it, but doesn't really have time because she still needs to l it to the carriage. And so she just leaves the heel on the steps, the glass, and she gets to the carriage and they start driving off into the distance, and they make it some distance before the spell ends. And she's left on the side of the road in rags, surrounded by mice and dogs, and sitting on a dead pumpkin. And eventually she gets over her sadness. She makes her way home so that she can wallow in misery under a roof. And then she's, you know, just going about her business, trying to not make it seem like she actually went to this ball. 'cause her step family wouldn't really be  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    About, about that. And all of a sudden the, the king's, what did I say? He was advisor. Let's call him an advisor. He's guy with the monocle. He comes to the door and he says, we have this shoe that the prince who marry whoever's foot, this shoe fits, and the evil stepmother thinks to herself, this is swell. Things didn't go over so well last night, but if I can shove one of my step, one of my daughter's feet into this shoe, we're home free. So she sneaks upstairs. This may have happened earlier, I don't remember, but she sneaks upstairs. She locks Cinderella in her room where she's wallowing in misery and then goes back downstairs. And they're all trying to put this shoe on their feet, but it's not working. Obviously they have huge feet because they're evil and evil People have big feet.

I think that's her names. I should have looked it up, <laugh>.

It got too close to time, and because she was a slacker, she wasn't getting herself ready. A couple minutes beforehand, she realized her ineptitude.

Uh, as time went on and he married, he married this woman and they were all living together. Um, it became apparent that the mother, who of course was the stepmother of, of Cinderella, was favoring her daughters quite a bit more than, uh, than she was the man's daughter. In fact, the daughter had the, the man's daughter had to do so much work and had, and ended up spending her nights by the fireplace instead of in bed.

So I immediately applied for a job with a PanAm games that took the whole duration of my master's degree to materialize. But eventually, in 86, I was, um, I was appointed vice president of international relations with the Panem Games.

That's the 10th Pan American Games.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    So essentially we offered, um, that the athletes would not have to receive a visa.

And finally, that the United States would lend every support it could to the organization of the 1991 games in Havana. So those were the four conditions that the Cubans requested. We said yes to everything. Of course, the last one was whatever is in our power to do, because we are not the Pan-American Sports Organization who is ultimately the one that decides where the next games are gonna be played. Um, and so, so Cuba, uh, agreed to participate and I was the one person that got the call from the Olympic Committee in Cuba from the Cuban Olympic Committee, confirming that they were going  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    To participate. And that was very thrilling because for a few minutes, I was the only one that knew that Cuba was going to participate in the PanAm games, which was a, a very, uh, sought after objective. It was whatever everybody wanted. And I was the only person in the organization that knew about it because I was, uh, acting as interpreter between the Cubans and the organizing committee, Lindy. So that was a real fra. Um, and the Cubans participated and the PanAm games went to Cuba in 1991, I was not a part of that.

There was food everywhere and the baby was a mess.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:00    The baby climbed onto Carl's back and they climbed back up the stairs, leaving the mess behind Carl Smart Dog that he was. Started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside. He got a washcloth, a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap, and he scrubbed the baby. Carl's mouth was full of soap and he made bubbles when he breathed, which made the baby laugh.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:36    Afterwards, Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry. He brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside. Then Carl had work to do. He went back down to the kitchen, finished off the bread, put the wrapper in the trash, lick up the milk. He looked out the window. Mom wasn't back yet. He still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around. At fun time, he looked out the window and saw mother coming home. The baby was laying in his crib quietly, and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited. Mother walked in to see them just as she had left them. She was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter. Good dog, Carl, she said and rubbed his head while he put his head on her lap.

Um, I, uh, the person that I had the most contact with, like this, that was my mother, and she, um, started to have memory issues back in 1995 where she would repeat her, what she had just said, and without any awareness that she was repeating herself. And of course, at first that's, you don't really know how to deal with that. And I had a, I'm not sure, honestly, I don't, I'm not sure that I did this, but I think that I would say, yeah, mom, we decided on that, you know, a little while ago. And so we're gonna do this. And so I would tell her what we had decided when she brought up first time. Um, so that gradually got worse. Uh, it was diagnosed by her doctor's vascular dementia, so she was having little tiny strokes that were knocking out connections in her brain.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    And, um, the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright, real intelligent, and she would tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something she would read in the paper that somebody had died and then talk about it, and then later do the same thing. And then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before. Um, and I didn't. And so I didn't know it. She would, she would make up reasons, logical, logical reasons why she hadn't known something. Um, she also got really good at asking questions instead of ask, you know, making, making, asking other people to talk instead of having them ask her questions. 'cause she knew she didn't, wasn't able to answer questions. Um, I, um, so I think, I'm not sure, but I think that this was some reading that I had done, which said that with a person, with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely no point in trying to help them to remember, or, or, or make them, or for heaven's sake, make them feel bad about not remembering things. Um, because of course, for, there's a period of time in there when you, when you realize, when my mother was realizing that she was losing memory and, and it was horrible for her. She felt awful. And, and of course after a while it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore, and that's really better. Uh, at, at least it didn't hurt her so much. And, um, I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:00    Experience means. Experiencing things mean when you means when you can't remember them. Like we would go to, um, plays and musicals and, and concerts. And this was when she was living with my aunt and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies really, but, but musical things, concerts and, and musicals. Musical theater. Mom would have no memory whatsoever of that the next day. But she loved it while it was happening. Just was delighted. She was always musical and these, this kind of stuff just pleased her no end. And so I had, it was really interesting to think about what she, what it means, what that means. Is it valuable? How valuable is it when you don't remember it? And I decided ultimately it was really valuable. \n"}, {"job_id": "jjPWgZTSwiYuYwUt", "filename": "wright80a_629080_864525.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Oh God.

The cat is in the woman's arms. The next picture shows, uh, two grown sisters stepsisters, maybe, um, with Cinderella blonde, um, carrying a tray, looks like a tea kettle and maybe a cup or two. And then the mother or stepmother or whatever, this lady with the dark hair or gray hair is, is reading something perhaps about a ball. And the girls, her girls are very excited and Cinderella was looking forward to going with a beautiful pink and white dress with bows. And the mice were all excited for her and everything. And, um, Cinderella got to the ball. And, um, the girls, or maybe it wasn't when she was at the ball, maybe it was before the mother and her girls were standing there and the girls took part of Cinderella's dress, a ribbon, um, off crisscross across her heart, <laugh> and um, um, <affirmative> then, um, she met with a lady, maybe a fairy godmother that had a magic wand. And there was a gentleman with like a whitish color pumpkin, and three or four horses that were not acting normal <laugh>. And she was giving Cinderella a white dress to take to this ball. And Cinderella had this white dress on and she was dancing with the Prince, and she knows the time was close to 12 o'clock, just a few minutes before, and she had a run.

So she, at the end, she and the prince were in the pumpkin carriage. And the two mice at the end were dressed up in some kind of drum major, major red costume, and appeared excited that they were together at the end. <laugh>. Okay, we have a little girl looks like whose cat climbed up on the tree, and the father who climbed into the tree on a ladder to retrieve the cat and the ladder fell down.

So the ladder falls down, the dog is bark barking at the cat, and the little girl runs to tell her mommy to call to come and help her. Mommy knows what to do. So mommy calls 9 1 1 and the firemen come and they're gonna rescue the cat and the dad and the dad. But I don't know in what order.

We called her Heidi, and I had three boys then, and the dog and a husband. And we played in the yard. When I, I was running with Heidi and just chasing her in my left foot bent, I heard it crack and it made a snapping sound. And I knew that was not a good thing to hear. So I went down on the ground and sat down immediately and got off my foot. I don't remember where Heidi went. The dog's name was Heidi and she was there, but I went, I got up the stairs 'cause it was, uh, the yard stairs went into the backyard going down the stairs. So I had to go up the stairs that my husband built this porch. It was a patio porch and with stairs.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:07    And we would sit out there and have our barbecue and that. So I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kind of dragging it. I would not step on the other foot that was broken. So I got upstairs and went onto the couch and I laid down and I, it was wasn't hurting. And when my middle son came home from school, he said, what happened to you? And I said, well, I think I broke my foot because I heard this snappy noise while I was playing with Heidi. He said, well, you have better get to the hospital. And I said, oh no, I'm okay. I don't have to go to the hospital. He said, oh yes you do. He must have been in about fifth grade. He said, you have to go to the hospital. I said, no. What? No, I don't.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:56    And he said, well, I'm going next door to talk to Steve. His wife is a nurse. So he went and he told Steve, and Steve told his wife, the nurse, what happened. Since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do, he ran off to find out some other advice. So the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor. So then I called my husband and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious. The nurse would know what to do, not me or not I son. But obviously he did know what to do. So when I went to the doctor, he, they x-rayed my foot. I had broken my fifth meta torso, or I think that's how you say it, and it's the bone that's on the side of your foot.

And, um, I just remember I was eight weeks pregnant. We had decided to tell both families that I was pregnant. Uh, we waited to tell them, you know, until eight weeks. And I was in California with my husband's family and I stood up from a chair and I literally could hear and feel something pop. And, um, I had a huge pain, um, more like a cramp. And then I don't know what happened, but, um, the pain was getting a lot worse. A this isn't a happy story. So <laugh>. Um, then, uh, that day we went to a friend of his family's house and, um, unbeknownst to me, I was getting a lot worse very quickly, but I didn't know. I knew that there was something wrong. I did not feel good.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:08    I was getting lightheaded. I was feeling like I had to go to the bathroom all the time. Um, and then we left their house and I was going to fly home with my year and a half year old daughter, um, on the plane. And then Jim was gonna drive the car back. And I got to the airport and I couldn't walk very far. I just got real dizzy and lightheaded and I'd have to sit down, put my head between my legs to get to where I could stand up and walk a little bit more. And I, we kept doing this. This was before we had security though, so, you know, you could do all of this stuff and not worry too much about it. And he could walk me to the gate. And, um, I got on the plane. I carried my daughter on the plane, got on the plane, I sat  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Down on the plane and, um, I knew I was gonna pass out. So I wanted to get to the bathroom. And I gave my daughter <laugh>, one of my mother of the year moments. I gave my daughter to a perfect stranger next to me and said, could you watch her for me please? I have to go to the bathroom. Um, I tried to get my head between my legs so that I could get some, um, head flow or blood flowing back to my head so that I could be conscious. 'cause I knew I was gonna lose consciousness. Um, I waited and waited and waited. I finally came out of the plane, I mean out of the bathroom. I sat back down. I took Sarah, we landed. Um, I knew I had to get to out of the plane and walk and again, before security.

She doesn't really care for her new stepdaughter. Um, and that's actually the last time we see the father. So presumably the father disappears, somehow he dies or, or something happens. So he's removed from the, the family. Um, the rest of the rest of the discussion kind of focuses on, or story focuses on the interactions that happened there. Um, as Cinderella is growing up, her stepmother and the, uh, stepsisters, uh, abused her and, and really used her as a, as a servant for the family. Um, Cinderella is a, is, is a very, has a good hearted, good natured, uh, young woman. She, she takes it all in stride, tries to do her best, and, and, uh, her new place within this family, um, the stepmother and, and stepsisters really never, never develop any affinity for her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    But Cinderella, uh, develops a fondness for many animals, including her dog, but then also mice and, uh, uh, other animals in the, uh, in the environment of her, of her home. She happens to live very close by to the castle and sees the castle every day, looking out the window and dreams of all the wonderful things that happen in that place, uh, but it's, uh, clearly outside of her reach. Uh, one day the chancellor and another staff within the castle, uh, decide that they have to have a ball. 'cause the young prince is at a point where he needs to select a bride to, to get married, to carry on the, the, um, the lineage of the royal family. And so they send out, uh, a notice to all of the families in town, uh, inviting, uh, uh, particularly inviting all of the young women who are of marriageable age to, uh, to come to this ball and, and to dance with the prince and, and possibly be, be, uh, ask for their, their hands in marriage.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:06    And so the stepmother is very excited and wants to one, one of her, of her two biological daughters to, to be the, to be the one selected. And so goes on. It begins with preparations to, to, uh, uh, for them to attend the ball. Meanwhile, Cinderella dreams of the, you know, the, everything that could possibly be, uh, in going to this mall. Not even necessarily thinking about getting married to the prince, but just what could, you know, it could be so wondrous. And, uh, but she knows she doesn't have clothing suitable for that or anything else. Um, and, uh, in talking with her animal friends, uh, they decide, in particular, the mice decide that they will make her a beautiful ball dress. And so they do. And she, uh, when, when it's time to leave with a ball, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Cinderella appears with, to a stepmother, with her stepsisters dressed in some beautiful ball dress and ready to go. Uh, they're, uh, they are very angry that she would have their front rate to actually think that she could go to the ball and being just a poor weight staff at this point in her life. Uh, and so they destroy her dress and tear up her jewelry that was prepared for her, um, and leave her crying and, and go after the ball. At that point. Uh, Cinderella, uh, has a fairy godmother, and that's where the fairy godmother enters into the story. Um, she talks with Cinderella and Cinderella says, of course, that she does want to go through the wall, but she has no way of getting there and no, no clothing suitable.

So I guess you could say they were having the difficult time communicating since every, most everybody spoke English and, and, but they spoke French and they were clearly having a tough time. So I went over, since I was quite fluent in French, when I was much younger, um, I went and asked if I could help them in French. And the woman said, I don't remember the course of the conversation, but she did get to a point where I really could not understand what she was saying. And so I said to her in French that I was sorry, it had been a long time since I had studied and spoken French. And I was sorry, but my French wasn't very good. And she said to me, no, it's not.

And I remember saying to my husband at the time, can you imagine being 70 years old and not having a grandson? Well, my first son got married and after a year or two they told us they weren't planning to have any children. Then my second son got married and we waited and we waited and we waited. And I had kind of given up Hopee when they called one night and said, uh, well, we are both on the phone. Mom put dad on the phone. Well, the last time one of my sons had asked to put dad on the phone was to tell us that he was getting divorced. So I wasn't so happy about that. So Dad got on the phone and now my son said, now there are five of us on the phone. I said, how fine. Well, he said, Stephanie and me and you and dead and a baby. And it still didn't penetrate. I said, what baby? <laugh>? 'cause I had pretty much given up Hope <laugh>. So they told us they were having a baby. We were extremely excited. And the baby was born seven months later. And we are of course thrilled with him,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:18    Boy's outside the house practicing with the soccer ball, practicing his kicks, I guess.

And lo and behold, it starts raining and he starts getting wet, gets, starts raining more heavily. He runs back home. Mom looks a little ticked off at him. He's wet, he's looking a little dismayed. And, but now he's on his way back to school with the umbrella r Well, I, it, it appears to me that these people were in some kind of a boat on a body of water because the man is wearing a, a, a vest, a life vest. The girl, however, it does not appear to be apparently there, there were some rapids or something, and for some reason the, they were thrown outta the boat. Boat overturned, don't know, they're thrown outta the board. They're now being swept down this waterway. The man grabs onto a branch that's hanging over the water and the girl comes by and he tries to get her to, you know, hang on also, so that she doesn't get swept any further away. \n"}, {"job_id": "l2Owvy9Yihlr0ajy", "filename": "wright84a_1470_236776.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    First I get the bread, peanut butter, butter jelly out on the, uh, counter, get the knife, and then I open the package, take out my bread, butter the bread, put peanut butter on, jelly on, put a top on, put it on a plate, and slice the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a half.

So there's a young woman named Snow White, um, and she works for an evil queen, um, has her doing all kinds of chores and, um, snow White gets sent off to live in the woods because she dreams of being with the Prince and the evil queen, um, doesn't want her to be with the. \n"}, {"job_id": "Ssh3lkj6JaqDs40B", "filename": "richardson39_12710_247998.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, well, once upon a time, there was a young girl named Cinderella, um, and her father had remarried a woman who was her stepmother that had two stepdaughters, or two, two daughters that were her stepsisters and, uh, her father, Sheila, very much. And then he passed away and left her behind, uh, to be cared for by the, the stepmother and her, her two daughters. And, uh, they, um, she showed a lot of favoritism towards her own daughters and, uh, used, uh, Cinderella more as a, as a servant or a housemaid than, than an actual stepchild. And, uh, Cinderella was, was made to sleep in, uh, quarters that were cold and damp. And, um, while everybody else enjoyed the lavish, um, ness of the, of the estate. And, uh, she had to, uh, do a lot of the menial work and be at everybody's beck and call.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:58    Um, and, uh, really suffered a lot, uh, in that state. And, uh, looked out her window frequently and saw the, uh, the king's castle up on the hill and wondered what life would be like, uh, in different circumstances. And, uh, then at the same time, the, uh, the, the king was very upset because his son, the prince, had not yet married and was, was coming to an age where, uh, he needed to be married to provide heirs for the kingdom. And, uh, so, uh, the king made a decree that there was gonna be a ball and that, uh, all the young maids of the, of the kingdom were to be invited and that the son would have to select from those that attended, um, someone to be his bride and, uh, to carry on the, the royal tradition. So, uh, invitations were sent out and the, uh, the stepmother, um, received an invitation and was excited for her two daughters to go and attend the ball, but concluded that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend the ball, um, that she would be eligible and she would be left behind.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    So, Cinderella was extremely disappointed and upset by this, and was, was locked away so that she couldn't attend while the others went. Um, but, uh, her, in her distress, um, her fairy godmother showed up and, uh, granted her the opportunity to, um, have a, a gorgeous gown and, uh, shoes and, and carriage and horse, which she, uh, uh, took all of the, the animals, uh, the, the mice and the cats and what have you that, uh, were favorites of Cinderella and, and converted those into, uh, a fancy carriage and horses with a, uh, carriage master and so forth that took Cinderella to the vault. And, uh, so she had the opportunity to go, but the only condition was that she had to be, um, back home by midnight. 'cause everything would go back to normal. And,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Um, the whole, whole facade would be revealed after midnight. So she went, she had a great time. Um, she got the opportunity to meet the Prince. Um, they enjoyed some, um, some time together and, and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company during the course of the fall. Um, of course, the, the stepmother wanted her daughters to have that opportunity and was rather jealous over this girl that she didn't recognize as Cinderella at the time. But, uh, uh, tried to force her way into to, to having the prince, um, recognize her daughters and, and, and, uh, everything. And, uh, so then when midnight rolled around, Cinderella had been having such a good time that she let the time get away from her. And at the very last second, she had to race from the, from the castle, um, to get in her carriage and, and make it home, and just barely made. \n"}, {"job_id": "1uMAxVsu3Ww7AZtW", "filename": "NEURAL18-1_298140_533423.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So I had my screening after all of my treatments, and I'm still in remission and it's 2020, so at least it's been that many years.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:11    Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. Um, so that's great. <laugh>. Yeah. Um, so, because now what I'd like for you to do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situation. So, and I'm gonna mute myself. Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:35    Um, well, I'm not, I'll just say a person or this person or, um, the difficulty in trying to communicate with this person is that this person, uh, lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time, um, conveying that in words. And many times it turns into emotion or feeling and, um, which, you know, can be anger, frustration, um, any of those sorts of things. But that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated. But on the outside we have no idea because those words never came out. Um, and so what I try to do is ask questions and see what kind of answers I can get to put together what the problem is. Um, because it's much easier, in my opinion, to deal with those sorts of things as they come up, rather than waiting until someone, um, is like a powder keg and just blows up.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:55    Um, however, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate because then their problem is why are you asking all these questions? Um, and then it's sort of like, um, then you back off and you give the time to, to calm down. Um, but then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because say in this, in this situation, it's a work environment and you, I need answers and I need clear communication. Um, so another thing that I have tried to do is I see, uh, one individual in our office who can communicate with this person. And so I take notes on how that person works with the other person, and I also use that person occasionally to help me understand and get information as well. Um, I won't say that it's, uh, successful all of the time, but it is, uh, successful enough for me to get by. So asking questions, backing off as needed, feeling out the situation and finding, uh, an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:17    Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand what you already talked about might also fit this, but if you could choose something different to talk about in this case, that would be great. Of course. Um, and it can be happy or sad, it can be from any point in your life, child from child to now. So do you need a few moments to think about what you would Oh, you know, Nope. Okay. Yep. Then I will mute myself and you may please tell me your story. Sure.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:47    Uh, it's one story, but it has two parts.

They came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father, her new stepmother, and her and the stepmother's, two daughters, Cinderella's stepsisters now didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful, and they were mean to Cinderella. And the mother, the stepmother, decided that Cinderella would be, the maid, would be like a maid, and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work. She made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning, and she had to serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters. One day an invitation came, the prince was having a ball, and all the eligible women in the city we're invited to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:19    The stepmother and the stepsisters were so excited, and they started planning right away for the ball. Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs, and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of, of very long, difficult, dirty jobs, knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in order to go to the ball. Cinderella was so sad. She went in her room and cried, and her animal friends gathered around her. She was friends with all the animals because she was so nice. The animals loved her. The animals helped her do her chores, and they all worked very hard, and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball. When it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs, and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked and the beautiful dress, they just went crazy with rage, and they tore the dress off of her and the pins out of her hair, and they pushed her down and told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:38    Crying. She went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her, and then fairy godmother appeared and took pity on Cinderella with a wave of her wand. The fairy godmother  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:00    Produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen, and Cinderella looked beautiful. The stepmother or the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball, but she had to be back home by midnight, because at midnight, her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal. So she took some mice and with a wave of her want, she turned them into horses and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. Cinderella climbed in her beautiful gown and went to the ball. Everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom, and the prince fell in love immediately. They danced all night. \n"}, {"job_id": "kCVKF2CVBYAOtU5P", "filename": "NEURAL40-2_26900_262107.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Um, see, other than, uh, being, having babies, uh, and, um, donating kidney, I did have, um, numerous colds and ear infections when I was young, so about five, when I was about five years old, it was determined that they were gonna take my tonsils out, so they kind of told me what was gonna be about and that I would've a scratchy throat. And I can't remember everything because I was five years old. Um, but I do remember waking up and my mom was there and she was so comforting to me, very, um, difficult to swallow. So my, my throat was swollen and it hurt, and this is a lot for a five year old. And my parents brought my, um, Ken and Barbie doll and Little Dollhouse. I could play with that while I was in the hospital bed. And I remember them bringing me lime sherbert, and it was so good on my throat. Um, I believe I was in the hospital about two days, and the recovery was, was fairly easy. It took me a while, maybe about four or five days before I could actually eat something that was truly solid. But that really did help with the colds because I didn't hardly have any colds at all. So, there you go. Easy peasy.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:14    Before we, I I give you the actual prompt, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating and we keep that pretty broad. Any difficulty communicating? Okay. Um, so then what I'd like is if you could tell me what the issues or problems are or were as well as what you do about those issues.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:37    Okay. Um, let's see, it was probably about six years ago. My best friend, her name is Sony. We used to work together. Um, and her husband, Steven, tall guy, ni, nice looking man. Um, he started doing weird things like, um, he left his glasses up in a tree. I'm like, what? And then he was forgetting things. And then, um, it actually got worse and worse. So about two years ago, she took him, Steven, to the doctor. They end up doing an Alzheimer's test on him, and sure enough, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and watching Steven go downhill. Um, it's been so sad. And, and to this day, he's still going downhill. And he is only 59 years old. Um, when I do see him, he now talks in two word sentences, maybe three, or you'll ask him a question and he just kind of looks at you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:52    And sometimes you have to do your hands or kind of visualize something for him, for him to understand. Um, I, I think he's on medicine, but it doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often. I haven't been there since the, the virus, but, um, I kind of just hug him and I just look in his eyes and just tell him, hi Steven. It's so good to see you. And he'll say, good to see you too. He doesn't remember my name. He remembers Sonnie's name, but he knows that he knows me. But, um, as far as what I would do to help him talk, I, there's not a whole lot I can do because his conversation skills are, are gone. They're just gone. But, um, keeping it really simple for him, maybe ask a question, uh, that's maybe real easy for him to answer that doesn't involve memory. Like, how are you feeling today? Or, you know, I like your pants, Steven. Something like that. So that's, that's about all I know that I could do to help him. It's just keep it really simple. \n"}, {"job_id": "d44n2p5Gw3h7uL6C", "filename": "NEURAL28-2_109377_344583.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, just curious. It was, it was only like a week really, that it was like they wanted me to stay down. I think I actually took like 10 days and just chilled out, but that's not me. So sitting doesn't, sitting doesn't do well for me.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:18    Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? Um, and this can be any kind of difficulty communicating. Um, we keep it kind of broad, but what I was hoping is that you could tell me what kinds of difficulties there were, what kinds of issues, and also what you did about it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:41    Um, I guess just learning as my mom gets older, that her hearing is not as good and I obviously have a little bit of an issue speaking up. Um, and I forget that she can't hear me. Um, and we've tried different, you know, my brother's tried like different hearing aids for her to see if that helps and, you know, you know, buying the headless speakers and stuff and stuff like that, it really doesn't help. So now I'm just really practicing, trying to look at her when I talk, which has become a challenge when if you have a face mask on. Um, but looking at her and remembering that she can't hear me 'cause I don't always think about it because I've known my, you know, my mom's never been heard of hearing and now she has a hard time hearing. I just have to remember to speak up. And often I don't remember that until I she, until I see her looking at me going, whatcha saying? So we're working on that one still. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:45    I would like you to tell me, um, uh, thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Um, something that happened to you, could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to now? Just any important event that you could tell me a story about.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    Um, the day my granddaughter was born, my husband and myself live in Florida and our son and daughter-in-law lived in, live in Ohio. And we happened to know that her, um, due date was January 1st and we wouldn't be able to make it. So we went up early for Christmas and we visited with, we were going to go visit them, but we stopped in Cleveland first and my, where my father-in-law lives and my daughter and son-in-law, my son and daughter-in-law live in Columbus. So we were at my father-in-law's and my daughter had also flown in from Florida. She just got there the night before and we stayed up really late. And then we woke up in the morning and we were gonna go do stuff and we got a call that said her water broke and that the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car, drove two and a half hours to Columbus and made it there before the baby was born. Just waiting in the waiting room with her mother and her stepfather, and then getting the texts that the baby was born and that they'd be out in a little bit. So it was a very exciting day. We gotta go see the baby. We gotta actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:36    So once again, I'd like to show you these pictures.

Ella finds a stash of her mother's clothing and through the help of her friends, the mice, the birds, the mice and the birds builds a beautiful dress for, she had been told by her stepmother that she would be allowed to go to the ball if she had a dress that fit and was good enough.

Nowhere worries at all childs. As they went outside, they saw a huge fat pumpkin sitting there and a bunch of breath scattering around. Cinderella looked at it, doubtfully that after seeing what a beautiful dress she had created, she was opened everything. The fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a beautiful white horse-drawn carriage. Cinderella was absolutely shocked. You have to get off to the ball, she said. Time's, time's wasted.

When she walked inside and saw the beautiful dresses and the shining earrings and the beautiful chandeliers, she was immediately taken back by its beauty, and she was going towards the ballroom dance floor. The prince himself was so humbled by her grace and by her beauty, by her innocence, and by her wonder. He immediately asked her to dance and it was love at first sight. They saw the joy and the authenticity in each other and danced the night away.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:51    Right before midnight, Cinderella heard the clock strike, and she knew it was time for her to go. She had been so lost in this happiness and this dream that she completely lost track of time. She ran out of the palace as fast as she could, leaving a slipper behind on the step against his pleas. For her to stay to know her name, she ran off knowing what her jet's name was gonna be. She hopped in the carriage and hi it off home. As it stumbled and turned back into a pumpkin and the beautiful gallian horses became little fuzzy rats. She got back to her house just in time to say, to go back up to her room in her rags with a pumpkin being a pumpkin and rats being rats. But she had a new sense of mind, new sense of wonder. She was no longer just the maid. She was no longer anybody else's peasant. She was her own princess. She was <inaudible> with a little bit of magic and with a little bit of hope.

Being totally  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    At peace as the sisters demanded, things didn't phase her as they asked for things, she obliged and stayed in the con, the confinements of her mind. And then one day there was a knock on the door, and it was an official in the castle. They announced that they were going around to every house, having every maiden try on the slipper until they could find what was the maiden that the prince had been looking for from night of the ball. As he entered, the sisters pushed and pulled and fought their way to the front so that they could be the first to try the shoe on, demanding that they have the prince's full attention. They tried to fit their feet into the slippers, but it was too small and it was too delicate flinging it around Between the two of them, the man decided that they were certainly not the woman.

Well, an invitation went out to all of the young women of the kingdom, and an invitation went to the home of this woman, and, uh, her two daughters and her stepdaughter. She read the invitation aloud, and the three girls were so excited about it. Well, Cinderella went off to her room. She opened up her trunk where she had an old dress, and she and her little animal friends found ways to add ribbons and things to the dress to make it presentable for the ball. Her sisters, um, at the same time, were trying to make dresses for themselves.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And when they saw the very pretty dress that Cinderella had made, they ripped off the ribbons and they ripped off the beads and the necklace that she was wearing, and they put them on their own dresses and ribbons until Cinderella was left with nothing presentable to wear to the ball. And the stepsisters said that she was not going to the ball. So off the stepsisters went to the ball. That night, Cinderella was left at home. She was out in the garden crying when all of a sudden, her fairy godmother appeared to her, and the fairy godmother waved her magic wand. She turned the mice into horses.

She was more beautiful, more lovely than all of the other women who were at the ball. His eye went directly to Cinderella, and he asked her to dance. They danced and danced. He danced with no other woman the rest of the night, and the two stepsisters didn't even recognize that  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    This, this was Cinderella.

When suddenly her dress returned to rags and the pumpkin, the, the carriage returned to a pumpkin. The horses became mice once again. The only thing she had left was one of the slippers, because it had fallen off. But she picked it up.

As time goes on, the father also passes away, and the stepmother is in charge of the girls, and she is very cruel to Cinderella. She uses her as a servant. She has her do the cooking and the cleaning. When the mother arrived, she brought her Cheshire cat along, and, uh, the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals, um, we're not treated as well, but Cinderella loved them all and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice. And, um, and they all loved her. As she was cleaning, she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle. Um, in the castle, there was a wonderful prince, handsome, charming prince who was approaching the age to be married, and the prince's servants, and the king said that he had to choose himself, a wife.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:13    And so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom, that there would be a ball. And at that ball, all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery, and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time. Well, the stepmother got the invitation. She only considered her daughters, and she didn't consider Cinderella at all. So she got the, her daughters, the beautiful gowns and the jewelry, and they were ugly stepsisters and Cinderella made her own dress. And with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals, she made a beautiful little dress. And when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters, ripped it to pieces and shredded and said that she is not going to go to the ball. That they are gonna go to the ball, but she is not.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    So, she was put into, locked into a, uh, room, and she was visited by the, um, fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the, the ball. So the fairy godmother, um, with her magic bitty, bitty bobbit boo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown and out of a pumpkin, she made a carriage. And out of the mice, she made horsemen, um, horses to carry, uh, the carriage to the palace. And she was dressed in her, the most beautiful woman in the, in the land. But she did have a stipulation. She said that, uh, she needed to come home before midnight or  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    The whole magic would disappear. So she went to the ball and she was the bell of the ball, and she caught the eye of the prince in the princeville, in love with her, much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters. So she danced the night away, and then as she looked at the clock, she heard the chiming of the 12 chimes, and she knew that she had to run home, or the magic of the, the night would disappear at that time. So she ran from the prince, and as she did, one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps and she ran and she ran. And then eventually when she got into her carriage, the whole thing started to disappear. The magic of the night, the pumpkin returned to its former self, and, and the animals were no longer horses and everything returned to herself to what they. \n"}, {"job_id": "PO4STXSEG9kIEG6e", "filename": "NEURAL20-1_2018335_2253225.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And with that, she waved her magic wand again.

And the little mice became her foot man. And the dog was there as her special servant. And the horse, excuse me, the horse, suddenly there were six horses and all of them were atti and beautiful plumage. And they became the, the horses that would draw the golden pumpkin carriage. So the fairy godmother helped Cinderella to climb up into the carriage, and off they went to the ball. Once they got there, the, um, Meyer Doomo, I'm not sure what to call him, but the man who welcomed the guests said, oh, who are you? And brought Cinderella up into the ballroom. And when the prince saw her come in, he dropped his attention to the stepsisters and all the other women in the room.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    And he was suddenly struck with awe at this gorgeous creature that had come into the room. And immediately he went over to her and he said, may I have this dance? And then for the next, for the rest of the ball, the prince danced only with Cinderella, but then there was a big clock in the room because Cinderella had been told by her stepmother that she could go to the ball, but she must come home by 12 o'clock because at 12 o'clock she would go back to being her old self Cinderella, the one who dusted the, the fireplace. And now she suddenly looked at the clock, and it was two minutes before 12 o'clock, and she said to the prince, oh, I'm so sorry, but I have to go. No, he said, don't leave. And she said, I'm sorry, I have to. And with that, she broke away from him and she ran out of the, out of the castle, the palace, down the steps.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    But as she did, she lost one of her golden, one of her glass slippers that had been given to her by the fairy godmother. And the Meyer Doomo, who was in charge of the guests, ran after her and said, no, wait, come back, come back. She said, no, I can't. But she had lost her glass. Sipper, slipper. But he found it and he took it. Cinderella got into her carriage. But suddenly, once again, she was just Cinderella. And the horses were just that one horse. And the dog was just the dog. He was no longer the footman. And the little mice were just little mice again. But who was that beautiful creature?  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Thought the prince. I must find her. And so he sent his emissaries out into the village. He had the glass slipper, and he sent his servant who carried the glass slipper on a pillow. And they went to all the young, to the houses of all the young women in the land. And they finally got to the home of Cinderella. But Cinderella was locked inside a door up high in her room. But then the footman said, let me try the glass slipper on your daughters. And they were all excited and they stuck out their feet, but their feet were too big for the glass slipper. And this was the last family in the whole village that the footman had, and his servant had come to.

Just reaching a, a point where she wasn't conscious a lot of the time and when she was, wasn't communicating very well. And she died in February of that year.

And, but it was much improved when we came back here. But then he had a downturn and died in April. And then when we were in Philadelphia in May of that year, my mother had some serious, uh, decline in health.

Uh, luckily I had a wonderful doctor who, uh, performed an operation on me and put me on a drug, which I had to take called Tamoxifen. Uh, I live in the lakes in Tempe, which is a very pleasant place to live. And over the years, over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication, I got to know very many friends who were extremely good, very supportive to me. And, uh, I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time. And also grateful for the knowledge that it's been 11 years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

And I had to do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could, which wasn't very easy because I had a sister-in-law who was not very kind at that time. And every time I made a mistake in Germany, she used to, she used to laugh and make fun of me. And I used to be very resentful about that.

So in fact, they made her do all the work and all of the chores. This other girl, the new, the daughter of the husband, her name was Cinderella, um, and they made her do lots and lots of work. She was very, very kind, however, to the animals, because they were really the only friends she had. Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace. And what was happening in the palace at the time was that the prince, uh, was, was time for the prince to be married.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:52    And so his father was saying that, that they, he needed to decide who he was gonna marry.

She ran down the steps, and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    She ran and ran into the fields until indeed her dress returned to rags and the coach turned it back into a pumpkin.

And the other is to get them at the right time of day. Um, or a good, or if he calls me, um, he, he usually will have something to say. Um, but if I really feel like I need to talk to him, um, I know not to call him in the morning, you know? And, um, and I know to hang up if he's, uh, busy and he, and he'll tell me. So those are the two things I've learned is don't ask a lot of questions. This is a mother and son <laugh>. Don't ask a lot of questions and get him at the right time. \n"}, {"job_id": "bm8tXq2nFPYx2eJs", "filename": "richardson17_35720_270108.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So, um, once upon a time there was a, uh, a dad and a daughter, and the daughter's name was Cinderella, and I think her mom, I think her mom died or there just wasn't a mom. And her Cinderella's father, married Lady Tremaine is their name in the book. And, um, she is the evil stepmother. Um, she also had two daughters, uh, I think their names are Anastasia and Ella. And, um, then Cinderella's dad dies and Cinderella's left with her stepmother and her, her stepsisters. Um, and so Cinderella's life pretty much consists of doing a lot of chores and taking care of, um, her step siblings and her stepsisters and her mother. And, um, she sort of dreams about being in a happier place because she's not treated very well and she has to do all the work and they don't have to. And, um, oh, but she has lots of friends with the animals that are in around the house.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    So there's a, a horse that she's friends with and a dog and a, and mice and birds, but she's not friends with the cats whose name is Lucifer, which I can't understand. Um, 'cause cats are great. Um, but she, one day a, an invitation to all the women eligible women in the kingdom. Arrives to attend a ball for the prince who is being pressured to get married Hmm. Um, by his father. Um, and advisors. Uh, so they're hosting a ball for all the eligible women in the kingdom.

And, um, Cinderella as an eligible woman actually should get to go and they're like, oh yes, if you get all of your work done, you can go, I guess. Um, so, uh, Cinderella makes plans to sort of, um, to wear her mother's gown.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:19    Um, and her animal friends thinks it would be really nice to, um, sort of upgrade promo's dress by adding ribbon and beads and, um, things to kind of work the ensemble accessorize basically, and <laugh>. And, um, so Cinderella works really hard and meanwhile, her animal friends are making her dress better and she gets done and then she sees her dress and she's very happy and she gets ready to go to the ball and her stepsister stop her and they snatch off her necklace and they tear the sash from her dress and basically leave her dress  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    In ruins. And so she couldn't go to the ball that way. And so she's out in the garden crying, and her animal friends are really sad because she doesn't get to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother comes and, uh, the fairy godmother arrives and helps her come up with a way to go to the ball. And she starts by, uh, making a pumpkin into a carriage and turning the animal friends into different, um, a driver a a horseman. And the, she turns the mice into horses and the horse into a man, which doesn't make sense, but, um, she makes the how to get there work first. And then she <laugh> she's about to sit cinder off and Cinderella's like, I can't go like this.

And the mother was hesitant, but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella. And the boy was walking to school and it started to rain. And the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did. And so he ran back home as the rain got harder, splashing in the puddles, and wetly came in the door saying nothing but showing his mother that she was indeed right. The mother was annoyed, but knew that giving the boy the umbrella is really the best thing for his health and wellbeing. So she gave it to him and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love the end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    Okay. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella, I would guess there was a little girl, and her father was widowed, and so he remarried. And the new stepmother had two daughters, the girl's age, and the stepmother was not very nice. And as the dad got out of the picture by an unfortunate series of events, um, the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave and turned her into basically a skully ma and made her clean out the fireplace, which is why she's actually called Cinderella. So I don't know what her name was before. And the one day, um, a message came from the castle and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife. And Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress. And the, let's just call her the wicked stepmother. The wicked stepmother, um, was not interested in letting Cinderella go. So when Cinderella came downstairs, she instigated a jealousy war with her daughters. And did I mention that mice and birds made her dress, actually not  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Cinderella. She didn't do that at all. And, um, they had taken things from the sisters. So the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was very sad, but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle. And as Cinderella cried in the garden, her rather plump fairy godmother came and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown, turned the mice into Coachman and horses, and turned a pumpkin into a coach. And Cinderella went to the castle. The prince fell madly and instantly in love with her. What are the chances? And, um, as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight, the magic would wear off. \n"}, {"job_id": "iyL22r0L89pxjwJD", "filename": "richardson37_23124_257505.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    John kicked the ball, it went through the window and landed on his angry next door, neighbor's lap, and his next door neighbor walked to the window <laugh> and looked out.

And he's like, oh, no, mom, I'm fine. I do not need an umbrella. And lo and behold, it starts to rain and he comes home soaking wet and he's like, mom, you were right because you're always right, <laugh>. And then the next day he took an umbrella.

And he was a busy man, so he was always off politicking, leaving Cinderella home with her stepmother and stepsisters and her stepmother wasn't very nice. And as she got older, more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less, the burden of being a rich daughter fell upon her and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her, do all of the work and wait on them. It wasn't a happy life. One day, uh, prince in the land came of age and needed to get married. And so the king said, prince, we're gonna have a ball so that you can meet some, uh, ladies to be married. An invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball, and she was happy. And so she went to get ready for the ball. And Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as well, but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done, which was kind of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:47    So the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house, including things that belonged to other people. And she slaved away the day. And so eventually it was time to go to the ball and Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready. The stepsisters and the mother were happy, but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made, and she was excited because then she could go to the ball. So she ran down the stairs to leave, and the sisters seen that her dress was made of things that belonged to them, tore her dress apart so she wasn't able to go and shambles. And while the stepmother sat and watched. And so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    And, uh, as she was crying, her fairy godmother appeared, introduced herself and said, uh, that she could go to the bomb and that she would help her out. So they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach, and a big, beautiful dress. And she was all ready to go to the ball. And, uh, so she headed off and the prince dance with a few people that saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her, and no one else really. He was very infatuated. The fair Godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight, everything would go back to normal. And so cinder Cinderella lost track of time and was about to strike midnight. She realized what would happen. And so she ran, and as she was running, she lost one of her slippers, and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was. She was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappeared. \n"}, {"job_id": "whrlpcydX8oQ43KA", "filename": "NEURAL24-2_709333_943613.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So the neighbor got up and got mad and looked out the window and yelled at the little boy for kicking his soccer ball through his window.

So her dad went and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree to try to go get the cat, but the cat got scared and ran out on a tiny little branch and the dad couldn't reach it. And when he was trying to move, the ladder fell over and he couldn't get down. At that time, the girl's dog went crazy and started barking at the dad and the cat in the tree.

And, uh, very interesting. I never thought that all, how, I never thought how complicated it was to do that. And, and all that goes into that. And it was a long process and probably took close to a year. We went through a domestic, a adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute. So that was kind of heartbreaking at the time. And then finally adopted my daughter when she was about two months old. So, you know, we always say we were just waiting for her. And, and of course she, um, always tells her brother that she was the chosen one, um, because we chose her and <laugh>, we didn't have any choice with him. He is just what we got. So, you know, I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different, because I gave birth to a child and also I adopted a child.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    I think it gave me interesting insight to both sides of it. And there's certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well. But you know, a lot of people say, oh, you can never adopt it wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah, she's my child just like my son is. There's no difference between them. So, um, and she, and she's interesting too because she says that, um, she wants to adopt when she's ready to start a family that she would like to adopt a child from the foster system. So I think that's kind of interesting her perspective on that.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:33    All right. Same idea here. Um, take a look at these pictures. They also tell a story. Um, I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:51    Little boy was playing soccer in his yard and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp. The dad stood up, got the ball, and looked out the window and glared at his little boy.  \nSpeaker 2    00:02:14    Um, these pictures tell a story, take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:32    So the little boy was getting ready to go to school and his mother said, Johnny, you need to take an umbrella. It's going to rain today. And he said, mom, it's not raining. I don't need an umbrella. And he left. And sure enough, as he got halfway to school, it started raining and then it started raining harder. So he turned around and he went back home and he told his mom, you were right. It started raining and she was not very happy with him. And so he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school.  \nSpeaker 2    00:03:03    So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this story, in this picture, and then tell me a story about what you see. Um, ideally a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:18    Okay. So the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard, and she was playing with her cat and her dog. And all of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree. And so she was very upset and she called for her dad and she said, dad, Sparky has chased peanut up the tree. And so the dad said, well, let me see if I can go get the cat. So Sparky's still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree. Dad climbed up the tree, but he couldn't reach the cat.

And Cinderella did everything that she was asked to, even though she didn't like it. But she always dreamed of being a princess and the castle. And so conveniently the prince needed, uh, the king wanted the prince to be married and made the duke in charge of it, or the general, or I think it was the Duke if I recall. Um, and he made him in charge of getting the son to be married, so decided to put on a ball <affirmative>. So the invitations are sent out and Cinderella gets one as as well do the, um, the evil stepsisters and the stepsisters are gonna go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And Cinderella asks if she can go. And the mother, the stepmother says that she can, but she has to do all of her chores and find a dress. So Cinderella's animal friends make her a dress, uh, the birds and the mice. Um, and then when she gets all presentable and she goes downstairs to leave, they tear her dress up and tell her she can't go. And so then they leave and she is very sad and her fairy godmother shows up out of nowhere and says that she'll give her all the things that she needs. But it expires at midnight, the blessing.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:48    And so Cinderella gets a nice dress and the carriage and the meister turned into her guards or whatever, and she's brought to the castle and to the ball. And the prince immediately rushes to her, much to the hatred of the stepsisters and mother. And, you know, they have a good time and they fall in love. But the, it hits midnight. And so all of her stuff starts disintegrating and the advisor to the prince, the general, or Duke or whatever his name was, um, chase is after her, but she gets away, but she drops a slipper, one of her shoes and everything else goes away except for her shoes. And so she's left with one and they have one. And so the prince says that he wants to, and she goes back home and the prince says that he wants to like find her. So he decides to try the shoe on every woman. And so eventually at some point he gets to their house and the stepsisters can't fit in it, and the stepmother doesn't fit in it. So they try Cinderella. It's a perfect fit and it's a match made in heaven and happy ending. So,  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:03    Alright. Awesome. Okay. And then one more, um, one more story. It's a little bit different. I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I have never made one before.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:17    Okay. Do I assume that you already have all the ingredients available or do you need to go and get them?  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:22    Um, it's kind of up to you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:25    I'm just gonna assume you already have 'em.

And so Cinderella was left in the care of the wicked stepmother, and she was very mean to her, and, um, made her work very hard to do all the chores. And they, the stepsisters were very mean also. And I, they called her names and made her do all their chores as well. And so she, she made friends with all the animals and because she was lonely. And, and then, um, and then an announcement came, someone came to the door and announced that there was gonna be a ball. And so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball. And since Cinderella was prettier than the other two, uh, stepsisters, the mother didn't want her to go because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince. So she locked, uh, Cinderella in the tower, uh, and they went to the ball and <affirmative>. So the, the animals, um, made, oh, well, this was before the animals made Cinderella address, and it was real pretty. And that's what infuriated the stepmother.

Then the dad died, and the stepmother raised the three girls, two of her own and her stepdaughter, Cinderella. And she treated Cinderella like a maid and not really like her, like the way she treated her two favorite daughters. And, um, Cinderella had to scrub the floors and keep everything clean and cook and wasn't allowed to do a lot of things that the girls were do doing.

Um, so when Cinderella was young, her father married a new woman who had two daughters. So the wicked stepsisters, um, the father died, and so Cinderella had to grow up with her stepmother and her two stepsisters, but they treated her as a servant and made her wait on them, the Prince's father.

And so at first, things are okay, and Cinderella just ends up having to do chores and her, her keep inside the house. And, uh, then one day there was a grand ball going on at the Great Palace and an invitation came that said all the ladies of the house could come to the grand ball. So everybody was really excited that they were gonna go to the grand ball in the palace. And so everybody was getting them ready. And Cinderella had a nice dress, and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters. So her stepsisters got jealous and wrecked her dress and, uh, made fun of her and everything. And Cinderella was upset and she couldn't go to the ball 'cause her dress was ruined.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And stepsisters just laughed at her, made fun of her. So Cinderella stayed at home and the stepsisters ended up going out to the ball. Um, meanwhile there was a magic mouse, or I think it was a magic mouse, that, uh, granted Cinderella wish and Cinderella wish she could go to the ball and, and have a nice dress to, to go to the ball. And, and so, um, oh, it was a fairy godmother. The fairy godmother granted the wish to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was, and turned the pumpkin into a carriage so that she could be escorted in to the, to the grand ball, in a nice carriage with her nice dress. So once she gets to the grand ball, uh, everybody's impressed with how beautiful Cinderella is and how nice her dress is. And the Prince asks Cinderella's dance and the evil stepsisters are there and are so jealous that Cinderella is there and now with an even nicer dress than she had before. And now she's getting asked to dance with the Prince, which all the stepsisters wanted, and we're so envious of Cinderella. So Cinderella was so enlightened and enthusiastic about being at the ball with a beautiful dress and now dancing with a prince, that feels like a dream come true. But, uh, the fairy godmother said, you have to be home before midnight, so otherwise everything won't go back to normal. And so Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight, so  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    She runs out, out of the ball right after the dance with the prince. But the prince wanted to know more about Cinderella. So the Prince chased after Cinderella was running down the steps, lost one of her slippers, but she didn't care that she had to get home before midnight. And, uh, so she gets in her carriage and often gets, uh, escorted away back to her own. Um, but she makes it home in time, so everything turns back to normal. Her, her nice, her beautiful dress turns back to a normal just apron dress. The carriage turns back into a pumpkin and everything. And, uh, so the next day, the Prince still with the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind, wants to find out who Cinderella was. And all he has left is a glass slipper. \n"}, {"job_id": "Eoi3m1UEylF4NHEh", "filename": "capilouto55a_1677849_1911032.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    A pumpkin for the chariot.

Anyway, all these possessions were taken and Cinderella's godmother was very, godmother, was busy, busy, busy making up things just so she would show up. Well, and she created with a, her fairy wand, the dress that Cinderella would wear and the clothing for the footman and the lovely coats that the horses had. And the whole thing was just top of the line. Just wow. So that they lined up at the door and with all these magical improvements and the fairy godmother remembered to say, you've got to come home by midnight, because it all goes back to the way it was before when the clock goes. So Cinderella was just a wow. It was just, was having a wonderful time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    And as she got to the palace, the prince saw her and oh boy, that was it. So she got to dance with the prince more than once. And the next thing you knew, clock was striking and all of a sudden came to her, ah, I'm over. I'm over. I'm overdo. Got to go. So she runs out and the prince tries to catch up with her, doesn't really make it. And all he sees is this ash girl running down the stairs and happened to be a glass slipper on the stairway where she had passed by. He catches the slipper and takes it back in and tries to find, who am I left behind? Well, nobody fit it. So they made arrangements to visit the community out beyond the, the,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Um, castle and all the young ladies were going to try on the slipper. And those two older girls really weren't that good looking, but they were going to try the shoe on anyway. And there was sort of some hard feelings about who got to put the shoe on and and so forth. And once, once they got to Cinderella's house and she tried on the shoe and it fit, and her fairy godmother, a fear appeared and wow, there it was.

It's a little stormy and rainy, but she's having a nice time and she sees, I think she goes down by the river and, uh, accidentally falls in and she's going down the river. She gets a hold of a branch and the aid people are called out and a fireman or rescuer goes out on a harness and gets her and they pull her in and everything's fine. After they check around, little Johnny looks like he's getting ready to go to school and mom's telling him, uh, here's the umbrella. He says, no, no, I don't need an umbrella. That's just fine. So he on, he heads for school and he gets partway and it starts raining. Pretty soon it's pouring and he goes in the house and he's all soaked and mom's sitting there giving him a stare and he gets changed and dried up and he takes his umbrella and heads for school, just happy as can be.  \nSpeaker 2    00:02:08    Okay,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:13    Now Johnny's says, must be after school.

And dad picks the ball up, looks out the window, and just staring out there and through a broken pan  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:54    And all ends well, they get the picture window fixed and everybody's happy. I'd be kidding. You said like before, no, this time's a little bit different. This is a story about Cinderella. Um, her father, it's married and shows her stepmother's, stepsisters. Well, that's not so happy for Cinderella because the stepsisters are like old princesses, or stepmother is a wicked old lady and Cinderella has to be a servant to them all.

There was a hunter, um, uh, who lived in the forest with his wife and his beautiful daughter, Ella lot. Um, sadly, Ella's mother died and being a very busy Huntsman, he realized he needed to remarry. So he married a woman from the town, um, who he really didn't know, but she was young and healthy, and she was available to take care of Ella. So they got married. Um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    Let's see. So they got married. <laugh>, unbeknownst to him, she had been married before and she had two daughters of her own. And so all of a sudden he went from having to support three people to five. But he did his best and they lived fairly well. Um, as the girls grew up, um, Ella's stepsisters, um, began to treat her unfairly. They realized that their stepfather loved her far more than they loved them, and they didn't understand why. So they would tease her and, um, her stepmother would start, would ask all the girls to do chores around the house, but eventually it just became cinder Ella's responsibility to clean. So, uh, she, her final chore was to clean the hearth, and she would get cinder's ashes all over her. And so they gave her the nickname syndrome. So anyway, now all of the girls are in their teens, and the prince, the local prince is, has decided to have a ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    His mother wants him to get married. Um, so, uh, and so he invites all of the eligible women from the land to come to the pool. And so the two sisters, of course, get very excited and their mother helps them choose their dresses, but they figure Cinderella doesn't want to go. You know, she's not very sophisticated and she's always dirty, and so they just don't bother with her. So Ciro is very sad, um, that she can't go to the ball. And, uh, so she's just sitting in the corner over by the hearth and they've all left, and all of a sudden, boom, all the lights flash. And this little woman, this little lady, suddenly standing there in front of her and she says that she's her very godmother and that she's there to grant Cinderella's wishes. So Cinderella says, oh, I wish I could go to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:06    So her, uh, fairy godmother texts her with her wand, and Cinderella is suddenly in this beautiful dress, and she texts her feet and she this beautiful glass like this. And she texts the pumpkin and it turns into this coach. And she texts the mice and they turn into the Coachman, and she texts the rat and he becomes the horse. And off Cinderella goes to the ball. So she arrives at the ball, and the prince only has eyes for her. She's the most beautiful woman. And they went dancing all night.

Um, I travel a fair amount for, for my job, uh, or at least I used to, uh, not going anywhere right now. So, um, but she was, she grew up with, with the Disney princesses. Um, she loved Disney movies when she <laugh> when she was really little, like two or three, and this is probably a testament to, to bad parenting. Um, we had to stop, uh, letting her watch Mary Poppins and Bed Knobs and Broomsticks because she was developing a British accent. And, uh, so that was kind of problematic for us, and we had to kind of, uh, dial, dial back that frequency with which she was watching those movies.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:10    But that's, that, that's how much she was really into Disney. So, um, you know, we got up early one morning and, and we told her that, um, you know, we driving me to the airport because I've got this, you know, I gotta fly out for work. Um, and then when we got to the airport, when we turn around, we're like, that's not really what's happening. We're getting on a, you know, we're all packed, we're going to Disney World. And, uh, I was so excited, uh, to see her reaction and she did not react at all. It was like, what? And then we repeated it and it was like, we kind of thought, well, maybe when it sinks in, she'll be like really excited now. She's like, oh, well, okay. And that was it, <laugh>. And we, we, it was as much reaction as we got from this like, Uber Disney child with a surprise visit to Disney. Uh, it's, uh, it, it was a, a memorable, uh, reaction fail.

So she runs out of the palace, leaving the blast slipper on the stairway,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And she goes out of the palace and she is outside with pumpkin and the rice and the horse. Um, and they go back home. But the prince finds the slipper on the stairway and began the search for the young woman who can wear that slipper. When they get to the wicked stepmother's house. Uh, the stepmother has a cane in her hand and where she's tripping up, the man who has the slipper on a pillow. But the prince gets, still gets around to trying the slipper on Cinderella and it fits, and they go off to the palace, move happily ever after. \n"}, {"job_id": "6s0WqmDn3JJCZVu8", "filename": "capilouto66a_490276_723112.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 2    00:00:08    Well, I have, I've had so many, uh, uh, I've, I've been fortunate to meet a lot of mentors that have been very good to me, to help me, uh, help me to advance in my profession.

Uh, my wife was pregnant with our first child, obvious because the baby was born about a month after we moved back to Kentucky. So it was obvious. And when we would go to what few houses, what few apartments were available, they said, we don't take where you're going to have children. That was in the days before, discrimination laws.

So I had pipettes and would try to blow air into them to get them to turn in the right direction. And because that was long ago, there was not equipment available.

So, um, at that point, uh, the stepmother and stepsisters treat, uh, Cinderella poorly, e effectively turning into her into an indentured servant. Um, meanwhile, uh, as a result of her duties, um, Cinderella is befriending a bunch of the animals, 'cause that's all the only people that can hang out with her are the animals, uh, while daydreaming about how nice it would be, uh, to live a better life like royalty, maybe. Um, simultaneously, um, the king's looking for an, uh, heir. Uh, his, uh, son is unmarried and they need offspring for the line to continue, uh, to foster the patriarchy.

So he kicks the ball and it goes into the window where his dad is currently sitting and studying, not studying, watching TV, it looks like. And it knocks down a lamp and it breaks the window. And his dad looks out the window at him holding, and he holds the ball and looks at Jack and says to himself, I've been there before. This has happened to me before. I'm not gonna yell at my kid, but boy, what a numb score.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:01    So here are some more pictures that tell a story.

And you may begin when you're ready.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:18    Okay. So Leo was getting ready to walk to school and his mom said, Hey, you, you really should take this umbrella because it is going to start raining and you're gonna be really uncomfortable when you're walking to school with no umbrella. And you get all wet. He doesn't really wanna take it. So he says, no, thanks mom. I, I got this. I'm gonna hurry and get to school really fast and I'll beat the rain. So he says goodbye. She looks a little, you know, disconcerted 'cause this isn't gonna work out. And now he is walking to school and is starting to get really wet. The rain's coming down harder and faster and he's not gonna get to school. He's barely even made it a, a quarter of the way to school. So he is going to rush back to the house as wet as he is and have to look his mom in the eye and say, mom, you were right.

It was a, uh, a day that this little girl was playing outside and she was clearly playing with her dog and riding her bike. And the cat got out and the cat ended up in the tree. So she had to ask her dad, uh, to come help her get the cat out of the tree. And then her, her dad got stuck in the tree.

So as he goes up the tree, he gets up to the branch and the ladder falls off of the tree, at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree, and which scares the cat all the more.

There's several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Uh, one of 'em is to get out the bread that's already cut and, uh, and put peanut butter on it. Uh, actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store. And so all you have to do is just use one, and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into the, into the jar, and you can put it right on the bread and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Very lazy, very easy. The good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of french bread, cut it in six inch long pieces, slice it long ways so that it's open, it's nice and crunchy on top. It's very soft on the interior. You take your peanut butter crunchy and some and regular. You mix those together.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:00    You put it on the peanut, you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich, you take the jelly. Uh, I wouldn't use grape jelly, but uh, you can use other kinds of jelly and I, I like strawberry. Sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together. I put it on there, and then I take that sandwich and I put it in the microwave and I heat it so that the peanut butter, the jelly and the bread all soak in together. I still have crunchy on the top, but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm. And then I eat that. Uh, four years ago, I, uh, uh, had my knees replaced. Uh, I had 'em both done at the same time. It was, uh, scheduled for  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    July the fifth. Uh, however, they, uh, fouled up on the scheduling.

Uh, uh, they prepped me and I went in to the operating room about eight and, uh, woke up about 11, 11 15, uh, with two knees.

And I really wasn't sure how to support her. So she was, she was mostly unconscious. She was kind of kept very low key with morphine. But I remembered hearing that, that the hearing is the last sense that people lose. So I would stay with her overnight and I would hold her hand hoping that that would, um, be soothing. And it occurred to me that I could, could share with her memories of our time together and that I could recount, um, beautiful images of our time, uh, at the Lakeshore where we have a family home and, you know, hour by hour her condition was, was just deteriorating. It was painful to see how hard it was for her to breathe. And I, I couldn't imagine what was sustaining her and why she was continuing in this harrowing state when there was absolutely no hope. Um, and so finally I actually held her hands and I looked in her eyes and her whole family was gathered around.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:01    And I said, if you are afraid to leave because of us, trust that we, we can make it.

Um, so again, just take some time to look over them and then tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:17    Are they mixed up these pictures?  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:21    No, ma'am. They go in order.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:23    Okay. All right. So are the pictures gonna stay here while I tell this story?  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:47    Yes. I'm not gonna take any more pictures away from you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:51    <laugh>. Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was on his way to school and his mother said, the weather report says it's going to rain here. You take this umbrella. He said, no, I don't wanna take the umbrella. Well, you better, you might get wet. Nope, I'm not going to. So the little boy began walking to school and sure enough, his mother was right. It began to rain, and then it began to rain harder and harder and harder. And he splashed through the puddles and he ran back to his home and he said I was wrong. And she said, yes, you were. Try it again, we'll dry you off, go to school. But this time with an umbrella. And so he did. And so he strayed, stayed dry on his trip to school.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:36    So this picture tells a story. Um, take a second to look at it and then tell me what story you see with the beginning of middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:47    <laugh>. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat, and the cat was chased by a dog and the cat ran up the tree and way out onto the limb as the dog stood barking there. And then she called her dad and she said, daddy, come and help me. Help me get my cat down. So the next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the tree and he got partway up and then he got stuck and he could not get down and the cat wouldn't come down. And somebody must have seen this and called the fire department because finally they came, but their ladders and they probably shoot away the dog and they put the ladder up against the tree and they help the father down. And then I'm gonna say the cat jumped down of his own free will. End of story. \n"}, {"job_id": "bkLJWSag59xYZYQZ", "filename": "NEURAL38-2_2141996_2374093.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Home. And, um, the very next day, the prince is very agitated because he, he, um, only knows who his favorite of the eligible women are because of glass slippers. She left and he's carrying the glass slipper to the household of each eligible woman. And when he gets to the household of the evil stepmother, the evil stepsisters all think that it has to be one of them. And the prince is not interested in them at all because they're nasty. And someone actually tries to break the glass slipper to keep the prince from finding out who the woman really is. But he, the slipper doesn't break. He finds that it fits, uh, Cinderella perfectly, and she gets to leave the house of the evil stepmother and go live with the prince and marry the prince to, uh, promote the evil monarchy into the future. And they, they kill the evil king, and then the prince becomes king, and, and she becomes queen.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:38    Finally, um, I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    Ah, I did that one before. Awesome. But I think I forgot a couple of things. If I was doing it today, I would, uh, walk 50 feet south and then 20 feet east up three stairs to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen I would open the refrigerator. I would take out the bag, which has the bread that I made a couple days ago in the bread machine, and I would take out that bag, close the door to the refrigerator, put the bag on the counter, take down the cutting board, open the, uh, cabinet with the knives, get out the bread knife, slice two slices of bread, then I would put the knife back in the cabinet. I take the two slices of bread, put them on the toaster, and push down the toaster. Then I would wrap up, twist the bag, hold the bag at one end, and spin it a few times, fold it under, and open the refrigerator and put the bread back in the refrigerator.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:53    While the refrigerator was open, I would find a jar of jelly and put it on the counter and close the door. Peanut butter is probably in a cabinet, but it actually, there isn't any except for what we use for the mousetraps under the house. But get the peanut butter and get a knife out of the drawer and spread the peanut butter on one of the slices of toast. After it came out of the toaster, it was just out of order. Like most recipes <laugh>, where it's like, what was I supposed to do when, when was I supposed to do that? And, uh, I'd lick off the knife and then I'd stick the knife in the jelly and spread the jelly on the other piece of bread, which is now toast. And assemble the two slathered pieces of toast still on the cutting board. Get the knife back out and cut it in. \n"}, {"job_id": "t7afSBw8KqxhqZnK", "filename": "wright24a_273020_505068.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Nope. Okay.

I'm fine. Then he waves at his mom to leave and the mom's standing holding the umbrella and he walks outside and he gets a little ways down the street and it starts to rain. And he's thinking, oh no, I should've listened to mom. And he hurries, turns around and runs back while he's getting wet, goes into the house and his mom looks at him very unhappily while he's standing there soaking wet. And he decides to take his umbrella and starts walking off to school again with dry clothes. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:46    Okay. Cinderella's dad marries a lady with two daughters, and the two daughters and the new wife come to live with Cinderella and her father. Um, the, the stepmom and the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella, and they're always picking on her and making her feel bad. And the stepmom always makes Cinderella wait on her stepsisters, even as they grow older. And Cinderella has to do all the work around the house, feed the horses and everything like that. Then one day a king tells his son that he needs to find a bride. So the king tells his son, I'm gonna have a dance and invite all the, the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to the dance, and you can pick one, and that's the one you'll have to marry. So they send a letter out and the stepmother gets a letter and tells her two daughters that they're gonna go to the dance to try to marry the king because he's or the prince because he's rich and they can use his money and Cinderella wants to go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    But the, the stepmother and the stepsisters tell her no because she's too ugly and she's poor, and she just needs to stay home and clean the house. So they get ready and Cinderella gets ready to go to the dance and the stepsisters rip her dress and tell her, no, you're not going. And they'd leave her home. Then they leave to go. And Cinderella finds a, a book in a trunk and reads the book and says a spell and a fairy godmother shows up to give her a new dress and some nice glass slippers to wear to the, the ball. And she turns a pumpkin into a chariot. And some little mice help Cinderella get to the ball by driving the, the chariot and Cinderella starts to dance with the prince and the mother godmother had told her that she has to be back by 12 o'clock, or her dress and her  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Sand, her glass slippers will go away and she'll just be normal again. So the prince falls in love with her, but she has to leave by 12. So she rues out and loses one of her glass slippers and then goes home. And then the next day, the prince tells his father that he's in love with that girl and he wants to find her. And all he has is this glass slipper. So the, the king tells him to go around to all the houses of the young ladies and try the glass slipper on. And he finally goes to Cinderella's house and her mean stepsisters or have too big a feet to fit in the little glass slipper and Cinderella's foot, um, fits in the glass slipper.

It was just, it had no, like, you know, that old song would A Difference A Day makes, I mean, <laugh> from the pregnancy, which was just wonderful. I ate everything I wanted. I felt terrific. I was working full-time. Uh, my freezer looked like an all convention I could eat, you know, my crinkle cuts my shoes, strings with pasta. I could do anything. I looked like meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital. I have to say <laugh>, my, my, my obstetrician, you know, during the, the buildup to this would say, you'll be sorry <laugh>. And I said, you know, I cannot imagine regretting this. You know, I'm eating, I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the, the, the, it's two pieces of pound cake, you know, with the Haagen-Dazs in, in the middle. So then I get to the hospital and, um, it was really nasty <laugh>. It was really, it was probably the worst experience I ever had. Um, I was told that if I had, um, um, automatic weapons, there would've been no one alive, left on the maternity ward. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    That's what I was told <laugh>. And, um, I did, um, it did spark, um, revenge in me that I actually carried out, you know, um, my, my obstetrician kept coming at me with first, what looked like a crochet hook. He said, well, we're just gonna break your water. It'll move things along. I said, no, don't step back, step back. Just leave me alone. I can do this myself, <laugh>, you know? And then, um, he kept saying, relax, I don't understand why you're not relaxed. And this is psychological. I'm sure every time he said, relax, I became even more infuriated. You know, this is the effect it had on me. And he wasn't listening when I said, stop saying that. When you tell someone stop doing X, you expect them to stop doing that. So anyhow, to fast forward, my daughter was beautiful. She was born smiling right away, recognized my voice. It was just a, the most special experience of my whole life. And, um, so now I went for my first postpartum checkup, and I'm sitting on the table and he, you know, does the finger prick and to get some blood out.

Although, you know, it was all in good fun because later on, you know, he and his wife used to work in his office and they had a nurse too.

But, uh, I would take and, uh, spread the peanut butter on the one piece of bread, and then take the spoon and drop some jelly on the other piece of bread and spread the jelly evenly over that piece of bread.

Somebody must have called, there's a bird watching it all, but somebody must have called the fire department. And here they come running with the, with the ladder. All right. Um, I haven't had a stroke, but I did have a couple stents, um, done two years ago, this past February.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:39    And I smoked up until that time, up until about two days before then that was February the ninth or 10th.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:47    And the, uh, surgery was on a Wednesday and the procedure, and Monday I ran out of cigarettes. I had one Sunday morning and I thought, heck, oh, Pete, I don't want, I'm not going to do any smoking. They're gonna make me stop anyway once I get in the hospital. So, so I didn't, I had that last one Monday morning and I haven't smoked since then. But getting back to my story, Wednesday at Winham, I'd already been to the doctor. He had done a stress test and he, uh, said that we needed to look at you more closely. And, uh, said what they do is they, uh, they put you somewhat under and they go up through your groin with the camera, then take a good look at your heart. And, uh,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    So I was sort of out of it, but I do remember it. And I remember, uh, the, uh, doctor's name was Richard.

He says, yep, I'm there. And I said, uh, how's it look? He says, well, we are gonna have a couple cents put in, and there's some, got some problems. I says, all right, must have gone back out a little bit later on. I said, uh, why are you doing doc? Are you about to dump me? He says, just finishing up. We should be done here in just a few minutes. And then I went back to sleep and, uh, I don't remember them rolling me back to my room or getting in my bed. And, uh, that was it.

That's probably the, like the singular event that's most significant. Yeah. Okay. I'll tell you a story, <laugh>, this is a story, um, about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, <laugh>, but it's so clear in my mind and I still don't, still doesn't make any sense. So my first semester, uh, of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa in Iowa City, but my family's from DC mm-hmm. <affirmative> and I had a car. Yay. Uh, so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car. Um, it's about a thousand miles, so it generally takes about two days. Uh, so the first semester back, um, it's winter, I'm driving across I 80, which is, goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:49    So it is an extremely boring, repetitive drive. There's a lot of, you know, driver tunnel vision that happens and it's cold and gray, so it's not even pretty greenfield. It's just empty, empty, empty fields. Um, but I'm, I'm kind of proud of myself 'cause it's, my first semester went well. I was, you know, independent, excited. Um, so I'm on I 80 in sort of the middle of Illinois and there's a slowdown and it's very flat, so I can see ahead. I don't see that there's construction. I don't really see an accident, but I, you know, figure something's happened. Probably a minor accident. It looks like it's a rubbernecking delay. It's kind of pissing me off. <laugh> I 80 at this point is only two lanes in each direction. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, and there's like no exits, snuffing built along it. And we get closer and closer and closer and I still cannot see what's going on.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:38    I'm just like, what, what could this be? And we get a little closer and I see, okay, it looks like I'm a, I'm in the left lane. Um, and then there's a medium between the, you know, eastbound and westbound route and I'm going east, um, and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left. And it looks as I get closer like an animal, can I get closer? And it looks like a fairly large animal. And I'm thinking, is it a cow <laugh>, is it a moose? I mean, it's, there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois, but it looks, it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it. So I'm getting a little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes going, why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:23    Wasting my time. I just wanna get home. Um, and I get closer and I can see that there's these kind of large hind legs. So it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car and there's kind of a long tail and it's brown and it's this big hump. Oh my God. And I get, I, I'm getting closer and closer and closer and I, you know, my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern magic going, what is this thing? I don't, it's not a cow, it's not a deer. It's too big to be a dog. And I'm literally, as I'm passing it,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Like my head is, you know, we're just creeping along. My head is sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view. And it's only till it's like at my shoulder and I passed it, that it, my mind kind of pattern matches and goes, it's a kangaroo <laugh>, you know, again, I have to turn around and look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me. And I spent like the next five miles going, no, there's no way. It was a kangaroo. And then go, but it, it wasn't anything else. It was a kangaroo. It was clearly a kangaroo. I saw the ears, I saw the big massive tail. I saw the big hind legs. I saw little tiny front legs. It was a kangaroo. And so to this day, it's this thing where I just don't know. I just don't, I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo. And I've even cer, I mean this was, okay, so this was the winter of 2000, 2001. So the internet was a thing. Yeah.

Uh, so I had to walk about two and a half miles on that condition, did a very cursory and, um, less than effective look at my injury and described me as, uh, rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches the next without, and just giving me mild anti-inflammatories the next day, uh, because it was a holiday.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:18    And, uh, through some sort of synchronicity, my battery was given KP duty and, uh, the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing KP because everyone else had been working.

She had to do all the work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    And one day a letter came in the mail announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom so that the prince could find a suitable wife, where you can imagine how much excitement this called. And the stepdaughter started thinking about, what will I wear and preparing their clothes for this occasion. And Cinderella went up and found a dress in a chest that held her belongings, and she came down and was starting to work on making this dress fit her. And the stepdaughters looked at her and they said, well, you're not going, you're not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the king's, the prince's wife.

She fled so quickly that she lost one of her glass slippers and root, and she fled back to her carriage and was taken home to the barnyard. And the reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight or else the, the spell would wear off and her true identity would be revealed. So for days afterwards, Cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience, but also saddened by her lot in life and the fact that it was such a short-lived pleasure. But Wendy not came on the door. And it was a, a court magistrate from the prince who had this slipper and was going around the households trying to find this special lost, um, woman.

You'll use one knife to, to spread the peanut butter on one of these face up slices of bread. You'll have to open the jar first, but once you've opened the jar, you'll have to stick the knife in and spread the peanut butter on and enough to cover the bread, kind of with a bit of abundance so none of the bread shows through. Then you'll take the other knife, you'll open the other can, which is of the jam, and you'll put the knife in and spread the other slice of bread with this jelly also liberally so that you can't see the bread. \n"}, {"job_id": "zgIz94POUK99OtOT", "filename": "NEURAL14-2_816038_1047471.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, my sister would not lend me her tricycle, so what I thought I would do is make her switch her attention to the cap.

He tried to climb the tree to get the cat off the tree, but then couldn't make it to the branch where the cat was. And then the dog started barking at my dad, 'cause the dog went, wanted my dad to come off the tree.

Um, I'll give you some time to look at each picture, um, and then we can review them again if you'd like. Afterwards, I'll have you tell me the story using any details that you remember of the story. So, but first, um, just let me know when you would like me to change to a new picture,  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:58    Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Okay.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:24    Okay. Okay. Would you like to see any of those pictures again?  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:29    No. Okay.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:30    Then I'll stop sharing my screen. Okay. So again, please tell me the story of Cinderella using any details that you know of the story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:40    Okay. So in this far away town, we used to live an old mother with her two daughters. \n"}, {"job_id": "iJNIlZJlGFwpv8nD", "filename": "richardson202_138590_369876.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:03    All right. And then I'm sure you've heard of the story of Cinderella. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. So I'm gonna have you look through this book. There are no words in there, just the pictures. Okay. Um, so I'm gonna have you look through it, take as much time as you need, and then whenever you're done, I'm gonna take the book back and have you tell me the story of Cinderella. Okay?  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:52    Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    Alright. So if you could tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Okay. Um, so it starts with, um, Cinderella's dad, marries, um, I guess her mom as at point, and her dad marries, um, this woman who has two daughters over her home. And, um, they start a new family, but then her dad passes away and the mother ends up being extremely evil and her daughters are really mean too <laugh>. Um, and then she grows up and she becomes the servant girl of the house. She cooks for them and cleans for them. Um, and her only friends are the animals, which she talks to <laugh>. And, um, one day, um, in the kingdom, um, the king basically says his son needs to get married.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:51    He wants all of the eligible bachelorettes, I guess, um, in the kingdom to come to this fall. Um, so he comes around giving invitations to all the families and the evil stepmother, um, gets the invitations reading it, and all the two, her two daughters are really excited and Cinderella wants to go. Um, she goes up and she goes into a trunk, I think it was like her mother's clothes or something like that. And, um, she finds this old gown. Um, and all I know all of her little, like bird friends and stuff help her, like put together this really beautiful outfit. Um, so later when the ball comes around, um, everyone's ready to go. Her stepsisters are ready. Um, and she comes down and they basically tear up her dress and they say she's not allowed to go. And I know in some versions they give her like a lot of chores to do and say, um, so they basically make it so she can't go. She goes outside and she's really upset, and her afraid godmother appears. \n"}, {"job_id": "8JJJCVWYCDdXi2LO", "filename": "NEURAL2-2_1724844_1955978.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And then, so she's upset, her dress is torn. She goes outside and she's crying. And then there's this, uh, nice older woman who, who has a special wand and says, oh dear, I'm going to take care of it for you. And then poof, she, um, waves her wand and then turns a pumpkin into a carriage and her mn dog friends into footman and, and horses. And then, then the next problem was that she didn't have anything to wear. So then she waves her wand and miraculously she's got a cool hairdo. She's got, um, her hair's all done up. She's wearing a beautiful white dress and glass slippers. So off she goes to the ball. She gets to the ball. She looks so amazing that no one knew who she was. And of course, the prince was like, oh, you're wonderful. And so then the prince, um, can't take his eyes off, off of her dances with her all night until the clock starts to strike 12.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:09    So then, um, she remembers something that the fairy, the older woman, the fairy god fad, very godmother, had said, you have to get home before the last strike of 12 at midnight. So she runs out of the castle because she doesn't want anyone to know her true identity. And she goes running down the stairs and she, as she's fleeing the scene, she loses one of her glass slippers and one of the servants of the princes runs and picks it up. But it's too late. She's already gone. And, and on the way home, the pumpkin turned back into a pumpkin and the dog turned back into a dog, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But she goes home and she's got these happy memories of being in the prince's arms. And I think that, that her family, family slash mother-in-law captor, um, or not mother-in-law. Yeah, stepmother.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:16    Uh, I don't think that they knew that she was the one. I think they had no idea. But for some reason she was locked inside of her room because I remember the key that the mice had used the key to let her out. So I don't remember why, but she was locked in her room. And at any rate, so the, uh, prince desperately wanted to find this beautiful young woman that he danced with. So they send out the, one of their, uh, servants to go out and try to find this woman by having all of them try on this class slipper. Of course, it's not fitting. It's not fitting, ironically, that no women seem to have  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    A foot that fits into these. I don't understand why <laugh> Does she have like such tiny feet? I don't get it. But at any rate, yeah, that doesn't seem to work. And uh, then somehow because of the mice opening the door, she's had been locked upstairs in some sort of a tower. I don't know what it was. And then she's freed and she comes down and she tries on the glass slipper. And it's discovered that yes, indeed, she was the one that was dancing with the prince. And everybody's like, oh. And then she gets sent off to go with the king or the prince and live happily ever after. And what happens with the stepmother and the stepdaughters? I do not know, but perhaps Karma decided that <laugh>, I dunno. <laugh>, I think that's the end of the story. \n"}, {"job_id": "LAiueJPJ7uWckt28", "filename": "capilouto53a_647080_877999.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, in 1941, I joined the Navy just after I got out of high school.

And, uh, I was there when the, when the, uh, Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. I was just a little over halfway through. And, and then my first trip to, uh, to sea, uh, I was, I was still 17 and, and I, I turned 18 or a couple days out, but I found that I was on the Armed Guard Service.

Cinderella is a young girl who, um, whose mother died, and she's brought by her father to live with. Uh, I, I think a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age. Uh, father meant well, but, uh, the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought, uh, and her daughters treated Cinderella, shamefully, uh, she became, uh, their maid, essentially, and, uh, had to clean the house, uh, take care of the fireplace, hence the name Cinderella, uh, do the cooking, do the washing, while they, uh, enjoyed life and, uh, uh, did what they wanted to do to, to please themselves. One day, the prince, they, they lived in a, in a principality. The prince, uh, whose father wanted him to marry, um, was, uh, asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which, uh, many of the, or all of the single women in the principality would, would be invited.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And the idea would be that he would, the prince would eventually, uh, pick one of them to be his wife. The three Cinderella's, three stepsisters prepare for the ball. The mother, their mother's very excited. And of course, Cinderella is excluded. She cannot go to the ball. Uh, and so she's left at home alone while the, uh, stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball. She's visited by her fairy godmother, uh, who, uh, grants her, uh, her wish of attending the ball because Cinderella says, how am I gonna get there? What am I gonna wear? Uh, so the fairy godmother, uh, makes a very nice gown for her out of magic. Uh, takes a pumpkin, causes it to become a coach. Mice become the horses, uh, I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman. So I forget which animal becomes the coachman. They take her to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:16    Um, she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and, and the stepmother, uh, but the, the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight, otherwise, or at midnight, everything would turn back to what it was the coach would become, the pumpkin again, et cetera. So she promises to return at midnight, but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight. So she panics, rightly so, runs, uh, gets back in the coach and is taken home. But one of her slippers, glass slippers, that was part of what the, uh, fairy godmother made for her is left behind.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And the prince, uh, at, at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and, uh, wanted to, to know who she was because she was gonna be the one. Uh, and the only thing he had to go on was this slipper that she left behind. So he has all of the young ladies in the, in the principality, uh, try the slipper on. It's brought to each of their houses. And of course, the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for, the one who was at the ball. And sure enough, uh, it is Cinderella's foot that fits, uh, who has slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother. And, but to her great delight, and, uh, the prince marries her, and they live happily ever after. \n"}, {"job_id": "sHhNbtnaorbn6Wq7", "filename": "wright62a_715470_945953.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:04    The beginning is, uh, this occurred in, um, <laugh>. This occurred in, uh, Louisiana. I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria, Louisiana. And, um, uh, we were then flying, I was a fighter pilot. We were then flying the, the, uh, swept wing version of the F 84, known as the F 84 F. Uh, and we were, uh, we had been out or, uh, on a, you know, series of missions, uh, and we were just returning to the base. Well, uh, actually I was by myself. I was flying solo, not in formation with anybody. It was, it was just a, just a regular training flight to ad hours to my log book and that of the airplane, and also proficiency. Just practice, practice this, practice that. Well, uh, in those times, we, uh, uh, we had a, a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at, uh, 340 knots airspeed when directly over the air when we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back, tilt the airplane onto a wing, and suck back on the stick in a very tight, uh, 180 degree turn in order to dissipate airspeed sufficiently that it would be safe to drop the, the, uh, the landing gear, the flaps, and the speed breaks, which I did.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:55    And, uh, uh, that was called the downwind leg at 180 degrees. After that, the airplane is slow enough so that we would, uh, we would've not enough touched the throttle. Neither would cut power completely and just bring it on around, uh, to the, you know, uh, to a, a full 360 degree turn, and then land on the runway. Well, um, the, uh, the, the legs of the, of a, of the pattern or called the approach 180 degrees, the downwind 90 degrees from that is the base, and following that is the final. So just fell. You're actually flying in a, in a circle. Well, here I am on the base leg with no power. All the garbage is out. We call it garbage. The speed breaks the flaps and the landing gear, and all of a sudden I'm about, I don't know, three, 400 feet off the ground, no more than that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:02    Maybe 5, 6, 7, 800 feet, something like that. I'm not really sure. The airplane started a shutter. A shuttering is the sign of a stall. That means the air. And when an airplane stalls, it means it's falling out of the sky. And I knew immediately people do not survive these, uh, situations like this. And yet, I automatically didn't even, I, I almost didn't have time to think, but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of records off the end of the runway. And I didn't want that to happen. Well, what did I do? I gave it full power, which did not catch in time. I pulled on the land. \n"}, {"job_id": "SB4vLF2notEFxwM3", "filename": "wright46a_711223_941671.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Rain so much more than ever before that a flood occurred and began sweeping away houses and people.

And they, they laughed at me. They said, oh, you're just trying to get rid of your double chin. And then I said to my doctor, I said that it seemed to be a problem because I was losing some feeling in my hand. And he said, well, it could be something with your neck too. And so I, I said, well, all I can tell you is all my friends make fun of me. 'cause if you look at all my pictures, I'm sitting with my hand on my face or under my chin or something like that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:52    I said, it's just like my head's too tired to hold up my neck anymore. So then they did an M R I and they said, oh yeah, good thing you tried to say something. Then I did 140 steroid shots over a year and I gained 50 pounds and I looked like a balloon and I was not addicted, but I, I lived on oxycodone, um, because the pain was just so tremendously bad. And then I finally went and got a, a second opinion from a neurosurgeon who said, we're scheduling your surgery for this week. You're lucky you didn't lose the use of your right hand, because there's almost nothing left of your nerve over there. So then they scheduled me, they cut open my neck, moved everything to the side, put some titanium rides in there. I went through some physical therapy and I was off work for three months and I couldn't drive and I couldn't run the vacuum even though I felt great, I wasn't allowed to.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:56    So I, I relied on a lot of people to keep me from going insane, being in the house for three months. So they took me out and did things and um, then I just rehabbed it and got better and just the support of everybody around me and even my spouse saying, you know, no, you're not gonna run the vacuum. I'm gonna run the vacuum. I know you're not gonna get the milk. I'll get the milk for the kids.

I had three surgeries, uh, early when I had the initial operation. Uh, that was before the days of scopes, uh, arthroscopes. So my first one was what I call slice and dice. They cut it and did the, took the pieces out. The next two were, um, scopes. And in those, uh, the, the way the scope went, uh, the second one, they were able to get some additional pieces that had fallen out. The third one, they were looking around at the knee and I remember distinctly the doctor saying, oh, what was that? And he moved the scope a little bit and saw a piece of meniscus floating by the scope and he says, oh, we must have missed this on this, on the last surgery, <laugh>. So that was that. So after that, I was still relatively young, uh, but it got to the point where I started getting, uh, pains.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:10    Once I was 55 ish, started getting pain, I went to an orthopedic surgeon. Uh, he worked with me for several years, did injections, trying to take care of, uh, luing the knee so it would be okay. And eventually those, uh, lubrications did not work. So that's when they went in for the total knee replacement. Since then, I've had lots of fun. Uh, I've actually been back to a different surgeon because we found out through gonna a different surgeon that the appliance that they used in my knee, uh, was one version. And the guy that I went to said, wonder why they used that one. And what they found was my P C L, which holds one part of my knee to the other part of my knee, was basically he used the word mangled. So it had been stretched out and twisted so much that my knee would pop out of place.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    Um, and he gave me two options. One was surgery and that changed the appliance. I'd have to do the full, another total knee replacement and put in a new appliance or go rehab. So I did rehab. I actually did a unique kind of rehab. I use a personal trainer and they were able to send him the information about my injury. So he was able to work with me knowing what the problem was. He worked with me to get to the point where I was in very good shape on the knee. I still have problems, but most of the way I've been recovering.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:55    Um, our next prompt, uh, we can move on here. Um, have you ever had an experience with people who have a difficult time communicating?  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:11    I have had a, a case where I was working with, uh, a, an a, a person that was doing a network evaluation. That's what I used to do. And the gentleman that I was working with had an extremely heavy Indian accent, and the Indian accent with the British wording made some of the times that it was hard to catch what he was saying. So I really had to work slow down, listen closer, and get him to slow down too. \n"}, {"job_id": "qzO3N2Z3hkDBiE2z", "filename": "NEURAL14-2_1048893_1279013.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And one day, uh, somebody asks her to adopt this new girl, uh, who was an orphan.

But on the night of the ball, she shows up with a very simple dress, and the two sisters tell her that that's totally inappropriate, and she cannot go to the ball with that dress. So she's Cinderella's in great distress as the sisters depart for the ball.

Okay,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:16    Well, junior was ready to go to school one day and his mother said, you should take an umbrella because it's gonna rain. And he said, nah, I don't need an umbrella. It'll be fine. So he walked out the door and on his way to school it started raining and he got soaking wet. He ran back home, talked to his mom, and his mom said, see, I told you, you should have taken the umbrella. So she gave him the umbrella and he walked the rest of the way to school with an umbrella.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:52    Wonderful. Okay, so take a look at this picture and look at everything that's happening and, and then tell me a story about what you see and tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. You can start whenever you're ready.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:07    Okay. The cat saw a bird singing in the tree. The, a dog chase the cat up the tree. The little girl wanted her cat, so she asked her daddy to get the cat out of the tree. Daddy climbed up in the tree and got stuck and couldn't get to the cat. Couldn't get down from the tree, so they had to call the fire department to come rescue him. Rescue. And they came and they got ladders and they're now gonna, the ladders up him down the tree and they'll probably cat down. \n"}, {"job_id": "uLWZu1g9ZUaa2cAd", "filename": "wright31a_160361_390236.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Alarmed.

And then I heard crashes and boom and crash and boom. And, um, I lived in California on the hillside, and so I was, I was in the back of the house and I was only afraid that the front half of the house had fallen off and fell down the hill. Um, but when I, it seemed like it stopped and it seemed like it went on for a long time, but I'm guessing it was probably 10 seconds. Um, but when I finally got up to go look, um, my kitchen was a mess. And, um, half the things in every cabinet had fallen on the floor, but the structure of the house was intact. But, uh, I had a lot of stuff to clean up. Uh, there's a girl caught in the water in a current, and, uh, she's stuck. And, uh, the guy with the life jacket on is holding onto a tree and trying to rescue her.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:26    Take a minute to look at this picture and when you are ready, tell me a story that has a beginning, middle, and end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:36    Uh, there's a boy outside kicking around the soccer ball.

And once they got together, uh, the woman's daughters, um, turned the man's daughter into sort of their housekeeper, their servant, and treated her very poorly. Um, and, uh, she was never very happy. Uh, then the mother got an invitation to a fancy ball that the king was having and the prince was having of the land and the woman was getting her daughters ready and Cinderella was looking at some pretty dresses and trying to decide what to wear. And the stepsisters were taking her clothes and taking parts of her dress, and she was all upset and they were getting all dressed to go to the ball.

I had to have a horse. I knew from early on that I wanted a horse. So I finally got a horse and I found my mom found me a trainer, someone to teach me how to ride and show horses. And, um, it came to my, I was, I think eight years old. And I came to my first horse show and I got on, Sam was the name of the horse and was very nervous. Had on my whole tuxedo thing and, and in order. Uh, so in, in horses, when you show, you walk trott and canter. And when, with Sam, when you wanted to make Sam canter, you tapped his sho left shoulder, uh, with your foot, foot, with your boot. And, um, I was behind this other horse and the announcer said, canter your horses. And this horse in front of me kicked Sam <laugh> in the left shoulder, and Sam took off at a Gallup and <laugh>. I, and both of my parents were there, and the horse was out of control. I couldn't stop the horse. And my brother, actually, my brother was there too, and he was taking pictures of me falling off Sam <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:31    And I fell flat on my back and I lost my breath. I couldn't breathe. And my father, who is a doctor, he jumped the fence and he immediately resuscitated me back to, to breathing. Um, and the, the highlight of the story is my parents never went and watched me show horses again. <laugh>, they stressed them out too much. Um, but that was like the only bad horse show I had. And I went on to show horses very, very happily. It was the love of my life was showing horses and horses for the next, uh, five years, I guess maybe longer.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:12    Again, we have these four pictures.

Um, but the woman was evil and she had two daughters. So Cinderella had two new stepsisters. Um, a few years later, her father passed away and she went to live alone with her stepmother and stepsisters. Um, they treated her very badly and she cooked and she cleaned and she slaved away all day long. Um, and then one day the king, um, wanted his son to get married. So, um, he insisted that his son throw a ball and invite every woman in the kingdom to find a wife. Um, they received the invitation and Cinderella begged to go. Her stepmother said no, but she decided to make a dress anyways. Um, or she said, her stepmother said If all the cleaning was done, the Cinderella could go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:09    So Cinderella makes a dress and gets all ready. Um, but when her stepsisters see, uh, her dress, they get jealous and they rip the dress to shreds, um, and proceed to go to the ball without her. Cinderella is devastated and starts crying. Uh, and then a fairy godmother appears and offers to, um, give her a dress, a horse and carriage everything she needs to get to the ball. So, uh, Cinderella is able to go to the ball anyway. Behind her, stepmother's back, um, she meets the prince and she dances the night away, but she only has until midnight. So the clock strikes midnight and she has to leave before everything turns back and back to normal. Uh, the horses will turn back into mice and carriage will turn back into a pumpkin or dress will disappear. So she runs back to the carriage and she leaves the shoe a glass slipper.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    So, um, she makes it home on time, but the prince still has her slipper and he says, I'm gonna do whatever I can to find this woman.

I don't know how to make it. So if you just tell me how to make the sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:21    Okay. Um, yes, you would get a plate and two slices of bread and get out the peanut butter and jelly and a knife.

Um, there's a ball that, uh, two teams of 11 people each vie for control of. Um, yeah. So I think of that, those 11, one is a goalie. Each, each team has a goalkeeper and a goal, uh, on a pitch of grass, about the size of a football field, maybe. Yeah, so like 300 feet, uh, lengthwise, maybe like 150 feet widthwise. Um, so that, that comprises the boundaries of, of the playing field, the playing space. And the 11 players, including the goalie, um, comprise halves of the, uh, playing space. So the, that playing space is cut in half. There's 11 on one side, 11 on the other, and then at halftime sides are switched. But, um, the way it starts is, um, a coin is flipped and whoever wins the, the coin toss, that team will start, uh, kicking the ball to its teammates, um, uh, from the center of the field.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:21    Um, so what happens is it's 11 on 11. There are, uh, different lines of that 11. The way it's, uh, ordered on, on the field, the, the people in the front of that group of 11, their main task is to score on the opposing goal. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, the ones behind them are kind of defense and offense. They can score, but their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score. And then the people behind them, it's usually three or four are like the last line of defense. They're called defenders, and they, they keep the ball, uh, far away from the goalie if they can. And the goalie, the absolute line of last line of defense, kind of guarding the goal and keeping the ball from going into the goal. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, the major rules is that the only p person that can use their hands, except on out of bounds throws, are the goalies. The goalies can use their hands at any time, but like any of the players, they ever touch the ball. That's a penalty with the, with their hand. They're, they're just moving the ball by doing what's called dribbling or passing with their feet. Um, scoring happens when the opposing team kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net, into the netted goal. And they can do that through, uh, what's called a penalty kick, uh, a corner kick, um,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Or just regular gameplay kick into the goal. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, the duration, the contest will last 70 to 90 minutes, and the teams that do the best, um, are constantly moving the ball in triangles. I think this is my theory, where they're passing, um, the ball to each other in triangular formations. They're spreading out in triangular formations over the playing field, uh, and giving, uh, the person with the ball like, you know, options of, of passage, you know, passing of the ball to, uh, to people at different points in the triangle. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and they're, they're, you can pass backwards. You can pass forwards, you can pass across the field to open space. \n"}, {"job_id": "bZL3b9CEGBEMoiZX", "filename": "NEURAL40-2_278937_508414.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, I'm quite sure I, I could, um, let's see.

She goes, but you're gonna have to if you wanna go out. So he's like, I think I'm just gonna go out anyway, so she didn't like that too much. So he went out in the rain. And you know what? He didn't like it so much 'cause it was pouring and he got drenched. So he went back in the house, he was really wet. Mom was not happy with him. He goes, she goes, so if you wanna go back in the rain and walk, that's fine, but you have to take an umbrella this time. And he goes, yes ma'am.

Huh? The previous, what else have I ever had? Ah, there's the thumb. Which one is it? Ah, it's that one. <laugh>. It was that thumb. That was when I worked at Firm Lab in Chicago for a couple of years and I lived in a area called West Chicago and had a motorcycle I'd bought when I was living in Bloomington after I'd graduated a geology degree, but didn't wanna leave. Well, I didn't leave town until I got the job at Fury Lab because I kind of, for, to do something. I was working for the university physical plant, doing sheet metal and roofing stuff and wasn't getting paid much, but it was enough to buy a Kawasaki H one 500 cc two stroke, three cylinder motorcycle, which was very fast, but handled really badly.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:34    And so I be really careful. But, um, the only real wreck I ever got into it, I was in Chicago and I was going home from Fermi lab back to the house I lived in, sort of in the country between the DuPage County Airport and the rural town of West Chicago. And as I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and the bikes started vibrating really badly. And I didn't recognize it because I'd had back tires go low before, but never had a front tire go low before. So all I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder, the front brake, and push the rear brake. And since the front tire had gotten really low, it just suddenly like down into the street and tossed me into the ditch. So I got up out of the ditch and there are two problems.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:35    One is that, uh, back then I wasn't very good at wearing protective safety gear. So I was riding motorcycle without a shirt, even a <laugh> pants and shoes and a shirt. So I had gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder that, that I hit with the shoulder. But the other problem was this thumb was just kind of dangling, like it wasn't connected anymore. 'cause it wasn't, this bone here was just broke and clear off. So this was really too many years ago to remember. It was 1979, but I think some of the neighbors were driving into the same gravel drive I lived in and, um, helped me roll the motorcycle, kind of up the little hill a bit and parked a motorcycle. And then I, maybe they gave me a ride home. I don't know. I just remember getting into my car. Uh, even then I had two cars, <laugh>. So one of the cars that would go to the, uh, DuPage County Hospital and went to the emergency room, they looked it over and they bandage it up and made me appointment to come back. And on Monday, it was Friday probably, I went back Friday. \n"}, {"job_id": "PUpxDj4GFOKLqYiM", "filename": "capilouto10a_441776_670346.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, more recently, I guess the whole world has, uh, suffered this, what do you want to call it? Crisis recession, depression, whatever it may be, the financial, from the financial end of it. I, on paper only, I guess I've lost maybe a hundred thousand dollars, but as long as you don't sell nothing, you haven't lost it, if you understand what I'm saying. That's where a lot of people, and I don't understand the business world telling these people, especially the, the mutual fund brokers and that tell 'em people to cash their stuff in and go to a mutual fund. Well, that's, to me, that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example, I've got a lot of Proctor and Gamble, and it was up, oh, last, last summer, I guess, around $74 a share right now, it's about 48 or 49. Now, to tell somebody to sell that and take a 30, $35 share loss, it's kind of ridiculous to me.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    But now that, I guess that's the way these agents, you know, make their money by talking to people, the public, into relinquishing what they've got is, that's good. Now, I don't say you should keep all your stocks, but you give 'em a blue chip, you know, then, I mean, I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive shares. And matter of fact, just last Friday, I went out and bought a thousand shares of Ford, and also I put in, I bought a thousand shares of a K Steel. Now, if you really, I being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier, and I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday, when you get a lot of diversified, you know, opinions and, uh, to, to, to sell the automobiles out, it doesn't make sense. But now on AK Steel, that's the same way.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    They were $74 a share, and now I put a bid in for $6 a share, and I'm pretty good. It was was five seventy six when I started playing phone tag with the broker. And, uh, so like I said, last Friday, I went to Fifth Third, met a broker there, and we put in a buy. For now, if you don't understand what a buy means, it was selling 6 21. Well, that said, when it goes down to six, buy me a thousand shares of it. And my reason for doing that is Obama wants to, uh, imp, excuse me, improve all the infrastructure. Okay? Infrastructure means steel, and that's where AK Steel comes in and all that. They haven't completed, you know, uh, through Congress what they are wanting to do, what they're trying to say  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    By American. I really don't believe in that. But, uh, it's, it is really gonna push the American steel up and all American industries are gonna start making recovers. But it was funny, I just listened this morning on television before I'd come down here and, uh, the state of Kentucky is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States. They're trying to pass that right now. So that's, to me, that was the most interesting thing to me. And the, uh, the worst thing was losing all that money. At my age, of course, I don't have to sell anything and I'm not gonna sell it, and maybe my heirs will, my wife will, but hopefully by then, if I leave that long, it'll go back up again. \n"}, {"job_id": "pg8XdnqAq659PjLV", "filename": "wright42a_238533_467016.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Uh, in my case, I think I went over 200.

I've been knocked out once, you know, playing football, but I'd never passed out. Um, and I knew I was gonna pass out, and I told the doctor that, and she said, okay, lay back. So I, I looked at her, I said, I can't. I can't, I don't dare. So she put her hands behind me and laid me back. And at that point, I don't know what was going on externally, but internally I was fishing with my grandfather and he was, it was at a favorite fishing place that I, that I had, uh, when I was growing up. And he was walking up the, the stream bank wanting to continue fishing, and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him, and I said, I want to go. I want to go. No, it's not your time to go fishing with me. Go home.

Uh, overall I was out for seven minutes, um, not breathing for seven minutes, and to this day have had little, if any, uh, effects, you know, after effects from that. You know, they, they say seven minutes, your brain is dead. Well, I have no idea why, but it didn't affect me. Not, I'm sure sometimes it affects me, you know, in some of my memory, but that could be aging too. So that is very vivid to me. The,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:56    Probably the most vivid recollection I have of, uh, communication issue with someone was an employee, uh, who was actually hired for me. We came in as, uh, I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe. Um, and needed an assistant. The assistant was brought in, and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us, we all kind of looked at each other and said, what did he just say? Uh, he's Filipino. Um, he's, he was, I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino. So he talks the go language.

And then her fairy stepmother or godmother, very godmother came to, um, and came and gave her, or created her a dress and a coach and a bunch of horses and like a little like groomsmen guy who tells the horses where to go and glass slippers and said she had until midnight.

You take one slice of bread and you put peanut butter on one side using the knife. Then you set that down and pick up the next slice of bread, and you put jelly on a single side with the spoon.

And, uh, she does not like it at all. And the sisters look a little jealous, really. So they continue on with their life. And, uh, the little girl's life, Cinderella brings tea to her sisters and they're not very happy with her. So the little Cinderella goes outside in the barn, outside with the animals. And she has a nice life with the animal because of the animals, because she can talk to the animals. And she knows that the animals love her and she loves them. She does not feel that her parents and her stepmother and sis stepsisters don't love her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:12    So she looks out to the castle. 'cause of all the wonderful things that happened at the castle, the king sends his assistant out to tell the people that he, they want to have a party, a ball, or, and to invite everyone. So he tells the, he is, gets a letter written, and the mother stepmother reads the letter and tells the daughters only two of them that they're going to be going to the part, the ball. So they get their dresses ready, and the little girl thinks that she's going to be going to the party too, because she overhears them. So the little mice make her up a dress. She looks in a book and she reads the book to see how, how to sew the dress. And the four little mice help her make a dress. Well, the stepsisters realize that the sister thinks that Cinderella is going to the ball as well. And they take her dress and they rip it up and tell her she will not be going to the ball.

We, we'd like to tell you our first, our, our happy story. Um, Ted and I got married and I worked for two years, and then, um, we decided it might be time for us to start a family, but two more years went by and then didn't happen. And, um, after a minimal amount of medical intervention, not much, we decided to sign up with an adoption agency. And we had talked about this before we got married that we thought we would like to have a family and maybe, maybe it might be nice to adopt children. So now we had this opportunity. So we signed up with the adoption agency and after we had completed all of the paperwork, they said, now you can wait. And it might be a long time, but this was in 1968 when it was easy to get a child, not like it is now.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:18    And five months into the procedure, I got a call one day from our social worker who said, are you sitting down? And I said, no, but I will. And she said, we have a baby for you. We have a little girl. Can you come and get her tomorrow? Yes, we can. Ted had, Ted and I had been in the process of setting up the nursery and now he worked until two o'clock in the morning to finish painting and finish the, finish the crib. And so we got to our 10 o'clock appointment the next morning. It was in October. I still remember how beautiful the golden cottonwood leaves were on the trees. This was in Denver, Colorado. And, and we were invited to come into the agency and we filled out some papers and then, and then, then we were ushered into the little nursery and there in a little white crib wearing a tiny little pink dress with little white flowers, lay our baby. We signed more paperwork, picked her up, loved her, and took her home and have been living happily ever since. Four years later we adopted another child. Michelle is blonde and blue-eyed from Denver, Colorado. Our second child is Cynthia and she has black hair and brown eyes, and she was born in South Korea. So we are an international family.

And then she didn't want to climb up there herself, so she got her dad to go climb up the tree, and then he got stuck and then now he can't get down either, and they don't know what to do. So the little girl goes and calls the fire department. Everyone's going crazy, and the dog's barking also because of the cat.

Well, this boy's playing with the soccer ball, he's being real reckless, kicks it through this guy's window, and he is sitting in his living room, enjoying himself. And, uh, he startled and then he picks the ball up and looks out the window, I assume, angrily.

Well, uh, it's obviously raining outside, but the boy's not listening to his mom who wants him to take the umbrella and Uh hmm. So he goes, okay. Yeah, I guess in picture two it looks like that he's, uh, he's happy and then the mom's angry, but I guess he's just saying, uh, whatever, mom, it doesn't matter. I'll be fine. And then she's being real angry with him and, uh, he goes outside, figures out he really doesn't want the umbrella. He comes back in, the mom gives him the, I told you so look, stripping wet.

And, um, the F 84 F has a, a jaw characteristic at full stall, which means that the nose will turn 30 or 40 degrees, either to the left or to the right. You can't predict it, but it will do that later. It was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe 'cause it's a jet. And you could also see where the grass was carried forward by contacting with, with the tail as, uh, it came in tail low.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    Well, pretty soon there came the ground. In retrospect, I can remember very well that the, the horizon was jumping up and down and the airplane did ya, but it still kept going in the same direction. It yoed. And as I say, uh, I remember the horizon bouncing up and down, but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on. Well, eventually it did, it did, uh, come to rest. It had the, it had yarded to the right so that at full power, the engine was, or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway, which is frequently in place, which is always in place, uh, for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up. Well, <laugh>, they about panicked well at which I followed the proper procedures. Uh, I cut all power, turned everything off, and with my parachute still trapped on to me. I, I, I think I may well have set a record for the 50 yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing. I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again. All they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground. They towed it back in to the hangar on its own wheels. Uh, and it, it did fly again. So did I, of course.

It was the, the thought was, I'll do what I know what I need to do, but people don't, don't walk away from these things. I walked away. It was later determined that, um, while I was, I was indicating the proper on my initial approach of 340 knots. One of my buddies was in back of me, also alone. And he, he was, uh, his testimony was that he was indicating 320 knots, which is 20 knots slower than I was indicating. But he could tell that he was overtaking me.

And they basically make her to be a maid. They're never very kind to her. And she has to do all the work on the farm, and she has to work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food.

So he declares that there'd be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region. So an invitation for a ball so that the prince can choose a bride. And they get this invitation at Cinderella's house. The stepmother reads it and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited. They wanna go meet this handsome prince, and they're just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess. So they get ready for the ball. And Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball. She wants to go dance and have fun. So she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends, making this beautiful dress for the ball. And when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters, tell her that she's not allowed to go, she's not going to go. They rip off all of her jewelry, they tear apart her dress, and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as well.

The more I walked, the more it hurt. But I really just kind of ignored it. I was more concerned about my right foot with the toenail looking like it was lifting off the bed. And I didn't quite know what to do about this. So I made an appointment with the foot doctor, but my foot doctor is in Waukegan, Illinois. And, uh, let's see. How did that work?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:29    Oh boy. We came, we came directly from, we had been on a, a cruise and we had visited our children in, in Orlando and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan so I could see the foot doctor and, and uh, man, I don't remember what happened. But anyway, when I finally got to the foot doctor, uh, she just explained that the reason the nail was lifting off was because when she had removed the ingrow and toenail, a new nail was growing underneath. So she just took the top nail off, took half a minute that was done. And then I casually mentioned <laugh> that my left wood was hurting. And so of course she feeling it and found the very painful spot. And that led to x-rays, which showed there was a small broken bone and which led to my having to wear a boot for a month and then come back for more x-rays.

And of course she's following him and nice thing about the visit is I really like that. Put doctor as a person and she's pregnant and she's gonna have her second child.

And it kicks the ball and it goes through a window and it's probably going uhoh, <laugh>, I'm in trouble. And there's, in the home you can see the ball coming through. Lance, break the lamp. A gentleman is sitting in, a chair is coming through there and he's standing up and of course looking out the window with a ball and Santa trying to figure out who and where this ball came through. So I would imagine the ending would be he's gonna go out and the boy's gonna be in trouble.  \nSpeaker 2    00:02:17    Take a minute to look over this picture. When you're ready. Tell me a story that has the middle and,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:39    Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:41    It's a school morning  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    And, um, the boy's got his backpack on and his mom's got the umbrella in her hand because she's saying it probably will rain. You need to take this umbrella with you. And the board is saying, no, no, I'll be fine. It's not gonna rain. I'm tough. I'll be okay. So he leaves the house without the umbrella. So as he's walking along to school and he, it starts to rain and he's going, oh no. And it's really starting to rain a lot harder. I, there's even puddles now. He's running back home and he went in his house and his mom looks like, well, see, I told you it was gonna rain. You need the umbrella. He's standing there looking just drenched and pathetic like, Hmm, I'm not as tough as I thought I was. So, and then he's leaving again with the umbrella and he's happy walking in the rain now. At least he doesn't getting wet onto school. \n"}, {"job_id": "idxolvRL37EPeZk9", "filename": "Baycrest11752a_564474_788970.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Doesn't matter. Okay. Poor Cinderella, who somehow or another became an orphan and had to live, live with, um, her stepmother and, uh, her two ugly stepsisters, um, who were very mean to poor Cinderella and made her wash the dishes and scrub the floor and do all the work, whereas the two ugly stepsisters laid around the bed, did absolutely nothing, and they berated poor Cinderella, called her names and bullied her, and she was basically their, their servant. There's also this prince who lived in the castle close by, um, who was going to be having a, um, um, not a prom, but a, a dance. Um, and there's poor Cinderella working away. And anyway, so the prince sent out this invite to, uh, the family, to the, uh, to the mother to invite the them to this gala. And they were so pleased, and they were all excited that two ugly sisters and this ugly mean old evil stepmother, and they were all talking about how they were gonna get dressed and that they were gonna wear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:32    And poor Cinderella says, well, can I go? And the stepmother said, well, no, no, you can't go, you know, you can't go. You have nothing to wear. And then poor Cinderella thought, well, yeah, but yeah, I do have something to wear. I could, I could maybe make something and you know, I'll show them and I'll have that. I can have something to wear. And anyway, Cinderella was surrounded by all these friends, these, these birds and animals in the forest that really loved Cinderella. And anyways, the night of the ball, uh, Cinderella, Cinderella's looking out at the castle and trying on her dress that the, the animals had helped her make. And, um, the ugly stepsisters learned that she was going and they tore a potter apart her dress and said she was not supposed to go, and that she can't go. And then the two sisters and the stepmother went off and left. Poor Ra all alone. Poor Cinderella was crying and weeping 'cause she'd really wanted to go. And all these other animals are, all her friends were as despondent as she was. Then all of a sudden, now she was crying. All of a sudden there was this fairy, this sparkling dust, and it was a fairer Cinderella's fairy godmother who said to Cinderella, Cinderella, if you really wanna go to the ball, I'll give you your wish. And she turned a pumpkin  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Into a, um, uh, the stagecoach thing, <laugh> and, uh, and the mice into these lovely horses that would pull the stagecoach and with horsemen with, uh, livery, and gave Cinderella this beautiful, beautiful gwn. And said to Cinderella, you can go off to the ball. And so off she went, thanking her fairy godmother off. She went to this wonderful, wonderful ball and was being held up at the castle. And the king, or the Duke, or whoever he was, saw Cinderella and thought, who, who that is? And the prince saw her and asked her to dance.

So he brought her to this house where these, uh, stepsisters and stepmother lived, and they took the girl in and, um, turned out they really, um, didn't treat her like a regular family member, that this girl had to do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got everything they wanted. And she was sort of like their maid. And her name was then Cinderella because she spent a lot of time among the cinders by the fireplace. And in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball, and all the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball. So when they got the announcement, um, Cinderella knew about it, but of course, that the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball, but she was going to make sure her daughters could go to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    So in preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things. Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house. And then they saw how sad she was, and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such. But, um, Cinderella, I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball. So as the day became closer, the stepsisters were getting ready to go, and they had beautiful dresses and she had to help mend them. And, um, let's see what happened. Um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:42    Um, she, I guess she went out in the garden and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad and she was crying and she really wanted to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother had said, you know, you may go to the ball, just, um, cha, she changed her frock into a beautiful dress, and she said, fetch me a pumpkin, and turned it into a coach. And the three mice came and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin. And so she was able to go off to this ball, and when she got there, the ball was in full swing. And the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the, the prince. And unfortunately, as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people. And one had a tick and then a creaky knee, and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just things that they just didn't know how to, uh, interface with the king in a proper way, or the prince in a proper way.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:31    Uh, and then when Cinderella came, all eyes turned to her and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince. And there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love. And, uh, they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting. And suddenly the struck, the clock struck 12. And, um, she realized she had to go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight. And, um, with that, she ran away. And in doing so, her glass slipper remained behind. She made her way home. She was a little sad because I guess she thought she'd never see this prince again. And then the prince was, found the slipper, and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper. So he and his coachmen, whoever they are, went around to all the fair maiden in the kingdom and tried the slipper on. And they did come to the home of the, um, where Cinderella lived and they, the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot wasn't gonna fit. And then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe and it fits, and they get married and live happily ever after.

It was okay, but at the end of the day, he was walking home. It had been raining all day long. It was still raining. So on his way home, he was walking through puddles, getting poured on.

And, uh, so she called her father, and her father got out the ladder and climbed up to go get spotty the cat. But the little girl and her father's dog barky came along and barky, uh, knocked over the ladder. So then the father was trapped in the tree trying to get spotty. And so, um, the dog was barking so loudly that the, I don't know, mom was inside and she saw this happening from the window. So she called the fire department.

He died or ran away, and the stepmother started treating her bad. They treated her like, like a servant. She would have to like, take them things. They would call and she would just have to answer to them.

And the guy came in and he was, I wanna say I guess inviting them somewhere because the lady, the stepmother had like a little script and was, the daughters were surrounding them and they looked happy. So I guess they were getting invited there. And so I guess Cinderella got invited too, because she started looking for a dress and she got a pink dress. And when she was on her way out, I guess the sisters ripped her necklace off. I guess they were being mean or jealous 'cause she was pretty or something. Um, but she went outside and was laying on a horse. I'm thinking that was, and she met someone, like she had a wand and she got dressed up and went to the party and she got there and <laugh> started dancing with some guy.

But um, in the end, like the guy, one guy was looking for the person who lost her shoe and her sisters were trying to get on, but it didn't fit their feet. They tried it with her foot and it worked.

Let's assume that you have two slices of bread. You then have to make a decision as to whether or not you're going to put butter on it or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly. Some people prefer that to put the peanut butter on the bread first because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth. So trying to satisfy as many people as possible, we are going to take a knife and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread, one slice or two depending upon how much you wanna fill the bread.

Um, so over the course of now, you know, uh, 16 years, there've been a whole number of, uh, various interventions that we've used with Hunter, uh, to facilitate better communication.

And they tore up her dress. So the fairy godmother decided that she would give Cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:12    So I believe it was a pumpkin that turned to the coach. I believe that Guus and friends became the horses and she took the carriage, oh, very godmother. Gave her a dress as well, and did her hair, probably her nails and toes too. So, um, but she told her you only have until midnight. So she attended the ball. The prince was gaga over her, and they danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight. She realized how dangerously close she was, and she ran down the stairs of the palace and lost one slipper. She got back. Everything turned back to normal, the pumpkin and the mice. And I think stepmom got suspicious about who that was, that the ball that the prince had fallen in love with and locked her in a room. But Gus and friends were able to get her the key. She got out. So when the palace guards came a calling, um, she was able to try on the slipper and they realized that it was her.

You have to have one on one side, one on the other side. And I would spread my strawberry jelly, um, jelly. It is sugar-free strawberry jelly. And I would spread that on the other side. I would get my Lay's potato chips, because you cannot do peanut butter and jelly without lay's potato chips. I would pour some on the plate. I would put some inside the sandwich.

So they throw a big ball. And, uh, invitations are sent to every, every house. And, uh, stepmother and stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they're going to go to. And Cinderella, uh, gets a, a lovely dress out of a trunk, and the, uh, stepsisters get all dressed and, uh, Cinderella's helping them with everything. At least in this book, she gets a dress out of the trunk, but I've never seen that before. But anyway, she helps the, the girls, the ladies get dressed and, um, she of course is planning on going, but stepmother and stepsister say, no way. You cannot gall. And so they leave and Cinderella is in tears and, uh, she's sitting by the fireplace and, um, the cis and so forth.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    And fury godmother comes along and tells us, asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball. And of course, Cinderella says yes, but she hasn't got any way to go. And, and, uh, she was told to stay home, but very godmother does her magic. And, um, Cinderella has another lovely gown and, uh, the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses. I think it's mice into horses. And somebody turns into, I guess what you would call a Coachman, and they take Cinderella to the ball and, uh, she's the bell of the ball and the prince is taken with her and they're dancing and so forth. And then all of a sudden it's almost midnight, which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she had to be back home because she would change back into old clothes and the coach would disappear and all that kind of thing.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:04    So she goes running away, and as she's running away, she drops a glass slipper and she gets home. And then the, uh, prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits. And, uh, the wicked, well, I'm not sure if they were wicked, but they sure were mean. Uh, stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper, and of course it didn't, uh, fit. And uh, somehow he finds that Cinderella is there and he tries to slip on her and it fits, and they get married and they live happily ever after. \n"}, {"job_id": "7lsKzRCtGFzT0u5A", "filename": "richardson38_18624_241601.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Uh, a young boy kicked the soccer ball.

Have you ever heard of the story Cinderella?  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:18    Um, yeah.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:20    Okay. So, um, I'm gonna ask you to, um, these pictures might help you, remind you of it. Take a look at the pictures and then I'm gonna take the book away and ask you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay. But you can take a look through these pictures if you'd like.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:36    I have  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:36    To look through,  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:38    I mean, you don't have to,  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:39    Um,  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:47    I realize you have two daughters.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:49    Doesn't really matter.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:55    Okay, go ahead.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    Okay. So there was a young woman who didn't have any parents whose name was Cinderella. And Cinderella, uh, had to go live with her evil stepmother. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and her three not so nice stepsisters. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and the stepsisters, um, just weren't very nice to her. And she snuck her way into a ball. And, uh, while she was at the ball, she had to be back by a certain time or she was gonna like turn into a pumpkin or something like that. But while she was there, she lost her glass slipper. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, but she danced with the prince. The prince loved her, was looking for the glass slipper. And eventually, in spite of her stepmother and evil stepsisters, um, wishes the prince eventually found her in the la tap after  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:40    <laugh>. Okay, great. So now moving on to something a little bit different. If I'd never made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tell me how you would make one.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:48    Okay. I would, first I'd go into my pantry and I'd get some bread, uhhuh, <affirmative>, <laugh>. And then I'd take the bread and I put it on the counter and I'd get the peanut butter out of the, the pantry also. And I'd get the jelly out of the refrigerator. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I would first spread the jelly because I wouldn't want the peanut butter to get into the jelly if I spread the peanut butter first. And then I would spread the jelly on one side and I'd wipe it off by spreading whatever's left over on the other side. And then I'd spread the peanut butter very nice and neatly on the other side, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I'd put it together and, um, probably put it on a paper towel and bring it over here and eat it at the table. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:25    Thank you. Okay. So now I'm going to show you, um, another, uh, pictures. These pictures also tell me, tell a story. Um, take a look at them and then I'm gonna have you tell me the story with the beginning, a middle, and an end. And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:44    It's the same as the other one.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:47    Okay. Go ahead.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:48    Um, so looks like the little boy is refusing an umbrella. So mom said it looks like the mom's like, you need to take an umbrella 'cause it's gonna rain today. He said, forget it, mom. He gets outside and realizes that his mother was right. So he runs back in and he's not too happy to admit, admit his mother's right. But reluctantly takes the umbrella and, uh, goes about his way.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:06    Okay. Thank you. So now here is another story. Um, look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:19    Okay. Looks like a cat ran up a tree. Little girl realized that it was her cat. She yelled to her dad to go rescue the cat. So the dad gets out the ladder, um, he climbs up the tree, and when he gets to the top, the ladder falls. And, uh, as a result, the dog who loves the dad starts barking very loudly and alerts, um, neighbors who call firemen, who come and, uh, rescue the father. And ultimately the cat. \n"}, {"job_id": "ruCWGq2NzkA0MnZ6", "filename": "wright47a_2750_225515.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    You take out, uh, if I was to make it, uh, I like, uh, peanut butter, butter and jelly on white bread.

He's invited his friends and his friends' parents over, um, for to open presents and have cake.

Um, I, uh, I once owned, uh, two Blacktail Prairie Dogs and we, uh, some friends of ours liked, uh, our prairie dogs so much that two separate friends of ours each bought a pair of prairie dogs. So we had six prairie dogs among the three groups of us. Anyway, one of 'em was going outta the country and needed us to watch their, um, their prairie dogs. And so, um, we did. And uh, one of them was a male and he was a little aggressive and he didn't like me very much. And, uh, so I was trying to kind of, uh, calm him, pet him. Uh, Tina could pet him, my girlfriend could pet him, no problem. But he didn't like me very much. And, uh, so I was trying to pet him and I was rubbing his chin and he was getting all bristled up, and I really didn't read the warning sign very much.

It's a pretty good bite.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    And, uh, I realized, well, I should probably not, um, I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it. And I, I don't always do well with sight of my own blood. Like I have no problem around other people, but I got all white faced and had to sit down for a while and I'm like, oh boy, what do I do? So I ironically, or funny that, um, Tino's actually swimming at a s u at the pool here. So I had to wrap my finger and drive just a mile or two down to a s u and interrupt her class and to get her to drive me, uh, to the urgent care, not the hospital for stitches.

Um, there soon she heard that there was going to be, um, a wonderful ball occurring at the castle, which made her very excited and wanting and dreaming to go to it. Um, stepfather knew that the wall was gonna be hosted by a prince because they wanted to, um, have a better chance in life. They wanted to save.

Um, when Cinderella asked to see if she can go to the ball, they inside, they were fine, but you would have to do all these chores that could not be done in a timeframe and time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:02    So as, um, she continued to work hard to try to make her deadline, her stepmother and her sisters were able to go, made sure that they gave her more work before she left, sat in because of the fact that she could not go, she made a wish. And as she made a wish, a fairy godmother appeared to answer her plea. Um, but there was conditions for doing this wonderful favor that she can go enjoy her night, but had to return at a certain timeframe that she was able to go to ball with all the magic that was brought to her on that occasion. She was able to be the prince had a wonderful time and lost track of time, and when she realized her time was being up, she had to run hastily.

Oh, I don't even like that. <laugh>. Um, you go to the store, you buy bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Um, they're two separate items. Bread, peanut butter, the jelly, depending which one you like. Some people strawberry, some people like grape, go home and you take two slices of bread and on one side you would take a butter knife, grab um, a little measure of peanut butter, slide it on one side. You grab the jelly with a butter knife, you will put it on the other side of the bread and put it to cut. \n"}, {"job_id": "LnRe8dqkK1RerxnX", "filename": "wright49a_5510_227535.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Out the peanut butter and open the peanut butter jar and use a knife and spread peanut butter on one piece of bread.

Uh, their, the mother of one little boy had decided to have a birthday party for his fourth birthday. Um, they took the bo, the boy and his two friends, and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day, and were planning to come back home to celebrate later. In order to prepare for the party. The mother had baked a three layer cake and was really excited that, that the boy would like it. However, when they came home from the park, they found a bad surprise. The dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house. So when they got home, the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with the broom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    Um, <laugh>, you're not gonna believe me. But anyway, two weeks ago, I was Saturday night, two weeks ago, on a Saturday evening, about 6:00 PM I started feeling a stomach ache, I thought, or like a side stitch. Ironically enough, the pain started to travel down my back. I could feel it moving. It wasn't a muscle. I couldn't, I, I'm much sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle, it wasn't a bone. Something was really weird and it was moving. They were kidney stones. Eventually I found out, but I remember thinking, I don't have yet insurance here, and I've just moved back and I haven't been to a hospital here in 20 years. This is going to be really horrible. And, and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where I had a fever of 101 or something, and it just was doubled over and couldn't even really stand, um, as the thing was making its way down.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    So we went to the hospital and the first thing I walked in is I said, I'm sorry to bring you bad news. And the woman said, why did my husband die? That's the receptionist. And I said, that's a good joke. But anyway, I don't have insurance. And she said, that's no problem. That's you're gonna get, come on in. And I remember thinking, okay, this is gonna be all right. Um, three hours later, after some medicine and vomiting at least 40 times because of the intense pain, the most intense pain I've ever had in my life, just imagine like stones going through that little opening, sorry, <laugh> and, uh, suddenly, and I was having these little strainer thing and seeing them come out and oh, and then for about a day of the blood and everything else. Um, but I was amazed, the body and how, and once, once they told me what it was, I read a little bit about it and realized it's not such a simple thing and how often we don't realize it. So water, people drink colas and coffees, colas bubble gas drinks  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Are the worst. And then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested. So I learned, and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much, and it wasn't even vomit. I thought my, my throat's going to come out because of the convulsions. Were so strong. And I just remember thinking, my wife and son are coming next week, and oh my God, here I am in the hospital. So I was really, I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it, except for the first time in my life, ever, not death, but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here.

The two unpleasant daughters didn't do much of the work around the house and were unpleasant to the nice daughter who was stuck having to do all the unpleasant tasks around the house, but had some robot mice to keep her company, who it helped a lot with her sanity in this unpleasant situation.

Whenever you're ready, please tell me this story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:54    All right. We have a, a boy probably in this backyard playing soccer, practicing, and he picks the soccer ball and it goes through a window.

Um, and there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and lamp falling over. And he gets up and goes to the window holding the ball. And that's all I can see. I don't, I think that's all he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:44    Here's another set of pictures that tell a story. Whenever you're ready, please tell me this story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:51    Okay. In this, in this story, mom is sending her little boy off, I'm guessing, to school because he has a backpack and she wants him to take the umbrella and he's a know-it-all and says, oh no, I don't need the umbrella. It's gonna be fine until he gets to the third picture and it starts raining and he, it's raining and there's puddles. It's a downpour. He's getting soaked. So he turns around and goes home and mom looks at him, brother sternly almost like you deserve it. Uh, and the next picture, the end of it, she, he set sets off her school again. This time he took mother's advice and has the umbrella.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:33    Thank you. So here is a picture which you have definitely seen. I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and then tell me the story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:45    Okay. Um, in this picture, it appears that we have a cat, that the dog chased up the tree 'cause the dog is still barking and the cat is out on a limb and there's a little girl trying, holding her arms up, hoping to catch the cat. Her tricycle was in front of her and there's a ladder on the ground. And dad, apparently dad is up the tree and I am guessing that dad got a ladder and climbed up the tree to try to get the cat. And the dog probably knocked the ladder down, but that's not for sure. But the ladder got knocked down. So now we have cat and dog, or cat and dad stuck in the tree and someone has called the fire department. There's a fire truck parked out on the street and we have two firemen running towards the tree with a ladder to resolve everything. And there is one other, uh, detail nets.

His name was Lynn Fuller, sat in front of me, and one day he turned around and said to me, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck <laugh> four times. And I'd never heard that word before. And, uh, so I didn't, I, but he said it with, you know, some kind of anger, <laugh>. So I, um, you know, just sat there and took it, went home. And I got in a fight with my bro, my older brother, who was always picking on me. And he, he kind of terrorized me, actually <laugh>, uh, but we're having some kind of fight with the, with the, our window, with a window. Either he was trying to open it or I was trying to keep it closed or vice versa. I don't remember. But he was going to overpower me and I could sense that. And so I said, I repeated the same words to him, <laugh>. And he said, uh, oh, you're gonna get in so much trouble. And he screamed, mom, Mary just said the dirtiest word in the whole world. So anyway, that's my story. Oh, and then, you know, he continued to be, he started to become like, he just, I became like his picking point, uh, for walking home. He'd throw things at me and just, he was a bully. Not a terrible bully, but a bully. I was scared of him. Uh, and he was on my walk home back when kids used to walk to school. But anyway.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:43    And so, once again, um, these pictures tell a little a, a story. So please take a look at them and then tell me a story with the beginning.

When Cinderella, Cinderella was a young girl, her father remarried and, um, brought home her stepmom and her two stepdaughters.

So, while she is, um, so while she is, uh, running, while she's driving home in the coach, the, the clock strikes finally 12, and everybody turns back into a pumpkin. She turns back into Cinderella with her torn clothes, but she has the one glass sliver.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    And then the prince and the king decide that they wanna find the girl with a glass slipper.

And, um, when the, um, when the prince's, when the prince's, uh, assistant comes and asks to see if there's any girls in the house besides stepsisters, she says, no, but Cinderella, the animals give Cinderella a key.

Um, they didn't want her because she was beautiful, so they were called the evil stepsisters. And so the mom put Cinderella to work while the girls just got to do whatever they wanted. Cinderella had to serve them tea and bring them whatever they needed and do all the housework, and she never complained. And she just did it with, made it friends with all the little animals. And she just went along her merry way Until one day the evil or the mom got a letter saying there was gonna be a ball, because I think the king or the prince needed to find a wife.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And they were all so excited. And Cinderella heard this invitation and assumed she would get to go. So she went back to her room and she got outta her chest of stuff and she got her dress out and she hung it up and her and the birds helped her make a beautiful dress. And she got all ready. And at the same time, the stepsisters were getting already. And when they all met to go to the ball, the stepsisters started ripping her dress and breaking her necklace and saying, you're not gonna go. And so the mom said, you can't go. And so the girls went off the stepsisters and went to the ball. And, um, Cinderella was sad. And, um, her fairy godmother appeared and she did her little magic with her wand and made a carriage to take Cinderella into the ball. But before that, she did her magic and gave her a beautiful white gown and some glass slippers to wear.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:23    So Cinderella got in the little carriage. She made it out of a pumpkin and went to the ball. But the one thing was she had to be back by midnight, and if she wasn't, that's when everything was gonna go back to what it was like her whole ripped dress and the carriage would be gone. So she was at the ball dancing with the prince, and she all of a sudden realized it was midnight and the clock started chiming and she ran. And when she was running down the steps to get to her carriage, her one of her glass slippers fell off.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    So she got in the carriage and it went back home. And then poof, she was with the animals in her old ripped dress, and she went back to her house. And um, then the next day, someone from the castle came with the glass slipper because they wanted to find who the shoe fit. And the stepsisters had huge feet and they wouldn't fit into the glass slipper, and they did not want Cinderella to try it on, but she did. And the glass slipper fit her.

You don't go with any strangers, you know, everybody's bad. In New York, we had the completely different view of California. California was like this fantasy land, you know, awesome place to be. You can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody. So when we moved here or when we moved to California from New York, I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you. And one time this, um, man stopped and he was like, do you need a ride? And I was, it was one of those days where it was, the evening was coming and the baths were like flying around and I was like, oh my gosh, I was so scared. Am I gonna make it home?

And he said, well, I'm gonna make a left. And I'm like, no, go. Right? And then that's when I was like, okay, something's wrong here. And um, so I just prayed at that point like that he would go, right, go towards my house. And, um, he's like, you sure you don't want something to drink? You know? I'm like, no, just please just go.

So then I'm knocking on the door and the sun's going down and I'm like, oh gosh, what if he's like just still right there waiting for me? And so when I thought he was gone, I ran over to my neighbor's house, which is my, you know, my best friend's house at the time. And stayed there until I knew my mom was home.

And she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters. But as it turned out, the sisters were not very nice, and neither was the the mom, her stepmom. And they actually put her to work, and she had to do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose. Um, but Cinderella was happy nonetheless, and she bused herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the birds and such. And she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella. And, um, she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride, and they invited all the eligible women from the kingdom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    And in her heart, she thought, oh, I would just love to go to that ball.

She went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said, we'll help you Cinderella. And they brought out some ribbon and some, some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her. And, um, she had the dress, but she had no way of getting to the ball. And she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared, and it was her fairy godmother and her fair, my fairy godmother said, don't cry my child.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    I know you wanna go to the ball and, and I can help you just fetch me a pumpkin and I'll turn it into a coach, and your mice friends will be the coachman. And so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the, the coachman and off she went to the ball, feeling like the luckiest girl in the world. And when she got there, she approached the ball and looked down the stairs, and there everyone was dancing, and they saw her come in and they turned and looked at her, and the prince looked, and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman that he had ever seen. He invited her to dance and they just had a nice connection. And she, uh, engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing. And, um, suddenly the time had gone by and it was midnight.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:25    And she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight So quick, she ran from the castle, and in doing so, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper. And she found her way home. And, um, the prince retrieved the slipper and was determined to find the fair maiden who left it there. So he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to, uh, find them, and everyone tried on the slipper. And when he came to the house of the, where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived, the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And, uh, it didn't quite work, but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in a room upstairs, and the mice gave her the key, and she got out and she came down and she said she'd like to try on the slipper. And with that, she tried on the slipper and her fairy got her, um, step wicked stepmother. And her sisters were amazed that she could have been that beautiful person that night. But as it was, they, she tried on the slipper. He knew she was the princess that he wanted, and they got married and they lived happily ever after. I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters <laugh> and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness. \n"}, {"job_id": "8veJzSHmHde5Loth", "filename": "NEURAL11-2_25608_243221.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, well, just to not be redundant, I'll talk about something else. I did think of another surgery that I had when I was younger was a, when I was a teenager, getting my wisdom teeth taken out. And I think a lot of people probably have had that, that done as a, I'm telling you, my dog does this every time. <laugh>, I know that messes up the transcriptions  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:24    <laugh>, don't worry,  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:25    Start. But anyway, when, so when I was 16, I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again, I'd never really had to have any, any anesthesia or anything like that. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course it was an outpatient situation, but since a lot of my friends had had it done before, I kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then, because <laugh> I know now people videotape people coming outta the anesthesia. But, uh, I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I'd never had anesthesia before. So it was, um, kind of interesting. And I just remember being, having the cotton all in my mouth when, when I was trying to talk and, uh, it was rather painful. I remember that too. And then having just, it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:21    Um, I know from last week that you do in fact have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. Um, so again, just share what problems that you've experienced, um, with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:41    Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research, it's been really interesting to me having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on, uh, a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has aphasia. I'm, I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this. But I do have to remember that even more so that when you're in person to slow my rate, uh, make sure that I ask questions, ask yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman who, uh, is actually in, in Mexico. They went on a trip to Mexico, um, before the quarantine and they actually kind of got stuck down there because they don't wanna put her on a plane. And, um, so anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:34    It was breaking up a little bit and we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So it was, it was a challenge to help because she did have some, some probably moderate aphasia. Her son was on the phone too, so I was on the speaker phone. So just that whole thing of really slowing everything down, asking her questions several times and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that was definitely, definitely makes you think about all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have aphasia. And I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one-on-one communication with folks.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:15    Um, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad, um, from when you were a child or more recently? Again, you can tell the same story as last week, or you can choose a different story.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:32    I tell different story. I have lots of stories.

We'll say it is, and he gets up and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out to the hole of the broken window and he sees the boy. And we don't have any more pictures here, but I think the little boy says, oh, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. And it, we'll, we'll assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry, sir that I broke your window, but I will work for you to try to replace it. And so that's what he did.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:41    So again, these panels of pictures tell a story. Um, take a second to look them over. They go left to right and then bottom, and then left to right again. Um, whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see with the beginning, a middle and an end, the  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    Little boy has his backpack on and he is getting ready to go to school and his mom says, it's raining outside or it's going to rain, and you better take an umbrella.

And so she said, all right, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school, and sure enough, pretty soon it starts raining, drip, drip, drip. And as then he, he keeps on, he, he starts to continue, but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now, and he's really upset. And he runs back home, drip, drip, drip on the kitchen floor. And his mother says, I told you. And he said, well, you are right. I do need an umbrella. So this time he was willing to take the umbrella. He put it up and off he went in the rain on his way to school.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:01    All right, so this first picture, um, tells a story. Take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat. And one day the dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree. And there the cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see from the picture, the dog is still barking. So of course the cat isn't going to come down. And she probably cried and cried. And finally her father came out. And, what's the matter? Kitty cat is up in the tree and the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat. And so he did, but the dog is still barking. It would've been nice if he had put the dog in the garage, but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get, but he can't get as far out as the cat is.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:00    If he did, he would surely break the limb and he would fall. So as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody, maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening and she called the fire department. And so here comes the fire department. They are going to put up a ladder against the tree, and hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree, but the dog is no longer barking. So the cat jumps down the. \n"}, {"job_id": "CZIaQOjdwdUHGfWo", "filename": "capilouto53a_408899_624940.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    He, he has a, um, a female who, uh, had the same ailment that he had.

And it, it could have used an awful lot of help <laugh>. Um, never saw the doctor the whole time I was there. And I think I was there pretty close to 10 days. When you, um, count the, it's not called extended care, it's well rehabs what it is. And, uh, they finally let us have a bath. Prior to that, we couldn't get the incision wet. So it was a little frustrating and it was fairly structured because nine o'clock say they came and brought a handful of pills and then at 10 o'clock they came and brought a pill and then they changed the shift and the next person came in and asked, how are you? How are you feeling? Can you move your leg?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:41    Can you do this, that, or the other thing? And their attitude was a very nice, they were, they made you feel like you were an intelligent adult and you can't say that every place you go with however, finally got to take a bath and oh, it felt so nice. And my disposition got better that day too. Um, they had an exercise person who came and had a wiggle our toes and stand on your toes and ra raise up your heel.

My husband fell off a ladder or he might've fallen off the, he might've fallen out of the attic. We don't know for sure. He sustained a severe, horrible head injury called the ambulance. We got him to Methodist Hospital where in the middle of the night he had three hours of skull surgery. And the surgeon told us afterwards, well, I fixed his skull, but I cannot fix his brain. So after that, he was one month in Methodist Hospital in the traumatic brain injury area. And then he was discharged and he went to a community rehabilitation hospital for another month for both speech and physical and occupational therapy. After that, he was sent to a subacute rehab place called Hamilton Trace, where he spent the next three months, then he came home to our house and we set up a hospital bed for him here in our living room.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:34    And then he had, um, a speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy and a nurse who came to see us in our home. And that occupied just about every morning of, of the week. And that went on during the summer. And then they decided they'd done what they could for him. And then we, then we signed him up for rehabilitation services at community, um, outpatient, uh, places one place. And he went there, I think it was three times a week for two to three hours at a time. And that lasted until pretty much the end of the year when they gently said, we think it would be good if you would take a little vacation from us now. And what they really meant was, we've done all we can for you, goodbye. But we also got Ted signed up with a place called Neuro Hope. And Neuro Hope offered physical therapy, but not the other two modalities.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:42    And so he has been a patient at Neuro Hope ever since. And I cannot say that he has made much, if any progress in any of those areas. His speech is still limited to Yeah, no. And once in a while, I don't know, but I have learned pretty much to tell what he wants even without language. We have tried Scrabble tiles and if I, yesterday for example, I asked him, what kind of sandwich do you want? And he wrote out bacon, although he had one letter, miss Misspelled, but it was close enough that I knew what he wanted. Um, uh, I wish that we had some way of improving communication with him, but we don't.

And we would always end up then at the horses stable and we would feed the horses and walk back home. But it was amazing because we literally did this every Sunday, or like I said, almost every Sunday. And every time it was as magical as it was the time before, even though it was the same thing, you know, the same pd, the same beautifully spread dinner, the same enchanted walk to the forest, the same horses.

And that's what he was doing until he accidentally kicked the ball into his neighbor's house and broke the window. And the neighbor was startled and upset and knocked down his lamp and disrupted his television watching for the afternoon. And then he looked out the window to see where the ball came and the boy was gone.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:56    Okay, so here are some more pictures that tell a story.

So this boy was the end of the school day and his teacher was suggesting that because he's a walker, she, she said, you know, you, you really need to take my umbrella because it's gonna start raining and I don't want you to get wet on your walk home. And the little boy said, no, no, no, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm gonna be fine. Uh, you keep your umbrella because I don't want you to get wet when you walk out to your car. And so she kept her umbrella and then the little boy started walking and the rain started coming down harder and harder. And he thought, oh no, my tablet is in my backpack, so I need to go back to school and I'm gonna have to let my teacher know that she was right. I need that umbrella so that I don't ruin the school's tablet. So he went back and that's what he did. He told her that he was wrong and that she should let him hopefully take the umbrella and use it to walk home. And she did.

And the dad gets up with the ball, looks out the window and is about to say something to the boy. The end Cinderella is about, um, a king and his daughter. And the king has to leave the daughter with some relative of his who have, um, two, um, two other daughters. So when the young lady Cinderella gets there, they treat her really, really bad. They treat her really mean. They make her do all sorts of cleaning outside with the animals and taking care of the house and cooking and sewing and stuff like that. And she has to live in this room. That's really, the whole house is beautiful except her room where it's up like in a dungeon. And one day, um, they get an invitation. The family, the step, oh, it's the stepmother. The stepmother. So the living with the dad and the stepmother, they get the invitation to the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    I'm thinking, this is right. Okay. Get the invitation to go to the ball. And, um, the two stepsisters are really, really happy about attending the ball. And Cinderella really, really wants to go and she knows she can't go. But then there's comes a, um, very godmother who grants her some wishes and she's able to go. She's able to go and, um, but she doesn't have anything to wear. So the fairy godmother gives her the three wishes. And one of them is a dress and one of them is a chariot to go and I can't remember what the other wish is.

And, um, the night of the ball, Cinderella goes in a big, beautiful white gown. And, um, a chariot with a horse. The wish, the, the fairy godmother makes the chariot out of a pumpkin, I think, and the mouse. And then it gets to the ball and she gets there a little late.

So as soon as the clock, as soon as the clock, um, makes that noise that it's gonna be 12, um, she runs off, but then she trips and she loses her shoe and she gets back home. And, um, the prince never finds out where she lives, who she's from. So he goes around the whole area and looks to see if anybody's foot fits into the shoe. And then finally, somehow or another, he gets to that house and doesn't see her. But then he gets, later on, he gets to see her and her foot fits the shoe.

It swept them down. They actually got swept out of their vehicle, and she clung to a tree for three hours as the cold water, uh, raced by her. And they called for help. And finally, rescue people actually were able to take a raft and get close enough so that one of the rescue, uh, gentleman could get ahold of her and bring her back to shore. A young fella was playing, playing soccer and, uh, his, apparently his yard, or possibly his neighbor's yard. And he had such, uh, good kicking ability.

And she leaves behind a slipper, a glass slipper.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    It's in the Disney version. Uh, and she gets home and of course, everything returns to the pumpkin. It was, uh, the next day the prince, or sometime the prince is looking for the girl who dropped her slipper because he is, she is the girl he loves. Um, and they go about trying the shoe on having every girl who was uh, in the kingdom try the shoe on. Uh, it doesn't fit the stepsisters. Um, and everyone is shocked in the household when it fits Cinderella. Anyway, she is the one and is revealed to be, and so she and the prince, uh, marry and, you know, traditionally lived happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:51    Great, thank you.

Um, uh, I begin with, uh, two pieces of bread, wheat bread, um, and, uh, I spread jelly on one side. I always do the jelly first, as I said before, um, so that you don't contaminate the jelly peanut butter. Um, and then, uh, I spread the jelly on one side, one piece of bread, face up and peanut butter on the other side. And then I put them together and cut them in half.

She had a daughter the same age of mine, and I, I came to know her because we each had a child in brownies and we, we really liked each other from the get go. We just, we just sort of hit it off. But what I came to find out about her was that she was Jewish. I am Christian. She was in a concentration camp in Germany, and thank goodness she, she managed to make it through. And she was on one of the first boats out to this country because she had relatives who had come over generations earlier in, in Chicago. And she ended up in Paducah, Kentucky. And we liked each other so very much that we became scout troop leaders together. And in the process of all this, of all the planning, we spent a lot of time together.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:05    And she told me much about her life in Germany and about the terrible, terrible times of the Holocaust. And one of the things that I remember vividly, the only reason that she really lasted her mother was Gentile. Her father was Jewish. And the line goes through the mothers, if you probably know this, uh, the Jewish Jewish line goes through the mothers. And because of this, her, her uncle, uh, this Ursula's uncle was the, uh, was her mother's brother, and he was of course Gentile. And he was the police officer in the town where she lived. So he was able to keep her off the list of the children who were going off to the concentration camps. But finally at the end, he couldn't do it anymore. And she told me one time, which just broke my heart, he set her and her three siblings off to concentration camp.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    And, but he would not look at the, or had our mother and, and her mother, the mother and the father managed to stay in Dresden. And they were both killed in the fire bombing in Dresden just before the war was over. But probably that was one of the most, and, and it was secondhand to me. It was all, it was not something that happened to me, but it was something that I became very much involved in because I listened to her stories. And she didn't just tell me the story, it was things she just told me little by little. And finally in the village where she grew up, they were going to, they, they had asked her to come back. They wanted her to come back. They  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Paid her, would pay her, you know, to get her to come. They, they wanted, they wanted some closure for them too, because it's a loan, it's a, it was a terrible time. And she wouldn't go and she wouldn't go. And finally, I think about a year, and she talked to me about a lot. She finally decided she would go. She didn't think it was a very good idea, but she went. And when she came back, she said, I'm glad I went. I was able to forgive. \n"}, {"job_id": "2tAA6KK1FZMT8cTq", "filename": "wright53a_718391_928380.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. Cinderella was a beautiful young woman who had two stepsisters and a stepmother that came into her family. When her dad married, her mother had died. Cinderella stepmother was awful to her, just awful. And Cinderella had to scrub floors and work hard and wear rags. Whereas the stepsisters had all the beautiful clothes and all the wonderful attention and love from the stepmother. Cinderella didn't have. So one day there was an invitation for all three. There was an invitation to go to a ball, and Cinderella was not included in the invitation because the stepmother wanted her to stepdaughters to go and meet the prince. There was a prince that was looking for a bride. So the stepsisters got all dressed up and ready to go, and Cinderella was left feeling very left out. But Cinderella turned out to have a very godmother who dressed her up in the most gorgeous dress, so that she was the most exquisite person at the ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    And, and she had all these little angels around that, uh, mice screwing around to help her. And all of a sudden, a pumpkin coach arrived with a fairy godmother's, uh, wave of the wand. Cinderella dressed up beautifully, got in the coach, went to the ball, but the fairy godmother said, you have to be home by 12 o'clock in midnight in order for this to work. So Cinderella met the, the prince. The two step sisters were raving mad because she was so beautiful, and the prince was, prince was giving her all the attention to the prince. And Cinderella had a wonderful time together, but then Cinderella realized she had to be on the way out by 12 o'clock. So she ran down the steps of the ballroom to get back into the ca. The, the coach and, um, left one of her shoes on the steps.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:33    She was in such a hurry. Her shoe fell off. So the prince spent, sent out all of his messengers in order to find the woman that belonged to this shoe, because he knew that he was in love with her, and that they would live happily ever after. So finally they arrived. Cinderella was kind of hidden away. His two two stepsisters were out there when the, when the Princess Meer came to the door to find out who belonged to this shoe. And somehow, uh, Cinderella was found in, in the midst of all, in the midst of all the drama about, uh, the stepsisters wanting to marry the prince and being right there out of front.

Uh, he didn't know that at the time, but that's what marriage reveals over time. <laugh>, she had two, two daughters, and so his stepdaughters, um, were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed. But things changed once they all arrived together and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude, and the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way. She performed servile tasks. Um, at one point an invitation comes to a ball and, uh, they're considering, uh, happily going. CI's face is lighting up, but she doesn't realize, um, what's going on. The ball is held because, uh, the king decided that his son, it was time for the son to marry, and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:25    Well, Cinderella would love to go, and, uh, it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and the stepmother and the, and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves. So they prepared. I had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy, but she was, there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family. Well, there's a book in the picture, in the book, picture book. I don't remember at all. She discovers the book. I don't know if that's where she, um, comes across an incantation, but a fairy godmother appears. And, uh, because in fairytales people do not have to go through things alone. The sweet little creatures, the mice and the little animals decide to help her. A fairy godmother helps her. And so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:19    And as, um, as she arrives, she gets to be at the ball. Um, I'm going to just remember that she, uh, dances with the handsome prince and that this, as she runs back, um, tries to get back home. She leaves her slipper on the stair. I didn't see much in the book about the timeframe, but that was a big thing in the movie that I remember in this clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight. But she had to get out of there by midnight. And, uh, she does, but then there is the, there is the return of the slipper, uh, the finding of the slippers. And that was the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    One that would match what, uh, he remembered about his beautiful date for the night. Um, but as I said, the book seems a little bit different. There's a key, and I guess when she lets everyone in, finally, where is he? Why is the key there? I don't remember that part heart, but, um, as I just remember, the story ends happily that he does find her and the slipper and they reunited.

Cinderella was brought into the, uh, family as a stepchild, and, uh, there were two other sisters in the, in the family, and of course, they did not, along with the mother did not like Cinderella. They used her as basically a maid to do all the chores and, and all the, uh, cleaning and everything else around the house. In the meantime, Cinderella made friends with the animals and, uh, the, these type of, of, uh, people because, uh, uh, they wanted to make her happy.

In the meantime, Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball, and, uh, her dress was made, um, by, um, mice and, and the animals basically made her dress, uh, and the fairy godmother, uh, she met a fair, no, no, no, no, no, no.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    She had her dress made, and, uh, when their mother saw her dress, it was more beautiful than her sister's was.

Fairy godmother, appeared to Cinderella and told her that, um, uh, she would be able to go to the ball. Uh, she would have her dress for her. And, um, they had a carriage, which was, of course, a pumpkin. Uh, but the only, uh, thing was that Cinderella would have to leave by 12 o'clock, be from the ball, uh, because if she didn't, she would turn back into her normal or her regular self again.

So her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl, her name was Cinderella. This woman came with two daughters, but they were unpleasant and they were ugly. We have to be honest. They were very ugly. So there's a great deal of stress. After Cinderella's father apparently died, she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters. And they used to make her clean and they used to make her cook, and they were very mean to her. And they made her live in the attic, and they made her wear ugly, old, ugly clothes. She was very, very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative. And she befriended all the animals in the house, the mice and the birds.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:42    And when she looked out the window every day, she used to see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father, the king and queen of Fantasia land and <laugh>. So she used to dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress, a fancy ball there, and wearing a beautiful gown. She never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her, and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear. And they always said to her, you'll never go to the ball. You'll never go to the palace. So one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big, very big dance because the king was sick and tired of his son not getting married. Seriously. All the pressure that goes on for women, just as much for men. And it was time for the prince to get married.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:27    'cause one day he's gonna be the king. And he needed to have children. He needed to have a wife. So they were gonna have a big ball. So they were having a ball. And Cinderella's ugly, mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes. And Cinderella really, really wanted to go. She was very sad 'cause she thought there was no way that she could ever go. But the mice and the birds that Cinderella's friends with were actually magic mice and birds. And they knew how to sew and they knew how to accessorize, and they knew how to design dresses apparently. So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella. And she was so surprised and so excited.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:13    Then she went to the ball, and at the ball she met the prince. And it was just love at first sight the way it should be. He loved her and she loved him, and they had a wonderful time dancing. And then her sisters saw her and were very, very upset that she was there and they were pulling her dress and they were tearing her skirts and they chased her away and made her go home. But then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to Mary. And so he sent out a message to all the houses in the land saying he wanted to come because he had found the magic slipper, the glass slipper that she had left. And he was looking for because he  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Knew, knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry. But the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper. So the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out. And then the prince did find her, and then they got married and then the king was happy.

And they of course went back and my husband and I were in the waiting room and they, uh, the my son-in-law came out and he said, we are in a birthing room and you all can come back and visit a little while.

I was an only girl. My daughter was my first child and she was a girl and we're all named for my father. We carried his family name down and I wanted this one, the first grandchild to be a girl so I could have the name carried down again.

Um, as when it goes through the window, it knocks over a lamp and scares the guy sitting on the couch. Um, and then the guy that was inside now or has a soccer ball and is probably not happy with the kid who just kicked it through his window that he's gonna have to replace the window and the land. \n"}, {"job_id": "3NbMQvFkBlVQJDpY", "filename": "NEURAL29-1_834935_1042435.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, there once was a time that Cinderella and her two sisters and her evil mother <laugh>, um, they lived near a kingdom where the king lived and his son, which was the prince.

So I'm used to running. But a couple years ago I would just running across the little grassy field and I started to speed up because it had started to rain. And as I was running, I got this sudden pain in my left leg and I had to like walk and walk with a little bit of pain back to the car. So when I got home, I put some ice on my knee and didn't think a whole lot of it till the next couple of days. And what would happen then was that I would get excruciating pain at times when I would attempt to put my left foot down onto the ground and the pain would only be gone as I lift my leg off of the ground.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    I had no idea what was causing this, but the pain was so severe, I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer. But in this case, you know, you hit it with a hammer and it's gone. As long as I stood on that knee, that intense pain would be there. So I finally went to a orthopedic doctor and after taking x-rays and an m r i, they found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot handle tear where the femur had actually gone through and the meniscus was still totally intact, but it looked like a teapot where you have that slender handle above the top of it. And he said, well, that's going to continue to do that to your femur unless we go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery and you know, you, you, you plan these surgeries and unfortunately things don't always go real well.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day. I think this day it was 1:00 PM so I got there. You had to go there an hour or so ahead of time. I ended up having it done at St. Joe's Hospital, even though I was going to be in, in outpatient. And I went in there and they, you know, clean your bag up and everything. And it turns out though, that this particular set of surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up. So my appointment at one in the afternoon actually took place at six in the afternoon and they finally wheeled me into the room and, you know, I not having any idea what they were going to do, I'm pulled into the room and they put me off of  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The, the, the one bed onto the real bed. And, uh, I, I feel these doctors like grabbing my leg and slamming it up against this rubber, uh, mount to the left of my leg. And, uh, I knew that they were going to do arthroscopic surgery, but I had not had any inkling on how this would all happen. In fact, I thought it might have been so simple. I had asked him to just numb the leg. \n"}, {"job_id": "1ycf65rnuGosHevh", "filename": "wright42a_1138595_1344291.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    She turned the pumpkin into the coach and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach and the cat was there to, to guide the coach.

But remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight, you'll become the same Cinderella that you were before. No matter where you are, you need to be, you need to come home. So as this clock was striking, mid the midnight, she ran from the ball and ran from the prince. On her way out, she lost her slipper. One of her glass slippers, she got to her coach and it immediately turned back into the pumpkin and turned, and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat, she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again. As it turned, the prince was so excited about this pretty young woman that he wanted to meet her. He had kept the, the glass slipper and knew that he had to see her again.

I I, I was out kicking the ball today, but I didn't, don't remember it going through anybody's window. And he said, well, that's a shame because they're, your initials are marked on the ball, on the Sharpie. Remember, I reminded you to do that so you wouldn't lose them, and your initials are on the ball. Oh. Oh, wow. I was too afraid to tell anybody, dad, I'm sorry. What can, what should we do? And he said, well, the first thing you need to do is to get some money, uh, from your piggy bank and take it over and offer to pay for his window. And then I think that she better apologize and never kick the ball out near his yard again. Okay, dad, that's what I'll do. Sorry, dad. He said, well, you've learned a lesson. Next time an accident happens, comes straight to me and tell me, we'll take care of it. But don't ever hide from your responsibilities. Okay, dad, I'll. So the next day they went over to the neighbor, or that evening, excuse me, they went over to the neighbor's house.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:56    James, Rob brought his piggy bank and, and he said he was willing to pay for the broken window and said how sorry he was neighbor said, don't worry.

So couriers went across the land and delivered the, um, message or delivered invitations to all the eligible, uh, bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    And the stepsisters were very excited, and Cinderella was excited too. But then they laughed at her saying, you can't go to the ball. You don't have a dress. You're just a scrub girl. And Cinderella was very sad about that, but her friends, the animals, um, made a dress for her, so, so she could go to the ball. Um, unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her, and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball. So they ripped the dress up and Cinderella was sent down to the, to the cellar. Um, and she cried. And then all of a sudden, a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying. And she told her story to the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother waved her wand and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with, with glass slippers. And then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin, and it turned into a beautiful carriage.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    And she waved her wand over the mice, and the mice turned into horses. So Cinderella arrived at the, at the, uh, royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress. Uh, she met the prince and they danced the night away. But the ci but the, uh, fairy godmother had worn Cinderella that she could only stay out till midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight. So Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight, and she ran away, and the prince tried to catch her, um, because he was so enchanted with her. But, um, he couldn't catch up with her. She, Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden slipper, one of her glass slippers on the stairs. Uh, she made it to the carriage and got home just in time. And the carriage turned back into pumpkin and the mice turned back, or the horses turned back into mice. The prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party. 'cause he was, his heart belonged to her now. So he sent couriers across the land again with the, with the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper, and then he would know who, who was the beautiful woman at the ball. So when the courier got to, um, Cinderella's house, the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Stepmother had the stepsisters waiting, uh, to try the slipper on. But unfortunately, they, the slippers didn't fit either one of them. And Cinderella came out of the cellar and sat down and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at, at the royal ball. And so brought her back to the castle and she and the Prince live happily ever after. \n"}, {"job_id": "YqdK9lYhbRFn7Jho", "filename": "wright48a_560_202996.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Let's make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

They walked back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken chunk. There was a big bite taken out of the cake, and they looked to see that the prince led right to the dog under the couch. Mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guest arrived and Johnny cried the guest as the guest walked in, they said, oh my, what are we going to do now? But the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything. So the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:32    In fourth grade. I was outside, um, during recess in New York, and as you may or may not know, they have, um, we play in the streets, in the public schools anyway, in the inner city, <laugh>, we don't have a playground, so they put up the barriers and all the cars are there and everything, and you're playing in straight. So, um, I was standing against one of the cars and a friend of mine ran right into me and, uh, my wrist went right around the, um, the rear view mirror and broke. So, um, they, uh, called my mom and my mom came and I was just crying and she rushed me to the doctor. Um, we took, I think we took the bus because she didn't want to pay for an ambulance. So I'm in pain on the bus, I'm crying, I'm trying to keep it still.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:29    And, um, got to the hospital and they had to put a cast on me. And that was my first time having a cast. And, um, got back to school and all my friends signed it. And, um, so that was cool. And then the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside. And so I remember one time my mom used like a one of the straws from the broom to try and itch and it broke in there. So then that was even more annoying 'cause I couldn't get to to it. Um, and that was about all I remember about that. And I, oh, and then I remember using it as a weapon too, <laugh>. As somebody bothered me, I'd hit him with it, but then I would feel it too.

I was trying to think of something odd like the, the girl threw the cat into the tree, but that's not likely. So I guess the standard, the standard story would be the cat climbed into the tree and really wasn't having any problems, but the girl was really concerned that the cat is trapped in the tree and wound up being a cat skeleton up there in a few days. So she got her dad and her dad climbed up on the tree and, uh, couldn't really quite get out as far as the cat. Meanwhile, the dog knocked over the ladder. The dad used to climb up the tree and is kind of angry with dad. Um, somebody used a cell phone and called the fire department <laugh> because some of the fire department knows about it and they're coming with hopefully a longer ladder to rescue the cat and the dog from the tree.

Then Carl goes and gets the milk, opens the milk container, pours it with in on top of the Hershey's syrup, and now we have chocolate milk. Now we go to the cookie jar and Carl takes the lid off.

Um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    Um, on my friend's birthday, she was a little bit intoxicated and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front and she was um, I think she was pretty spun on something else and she was just shouting, having fights with everybody.

And um, and then he was actually, 'cause my friend then got really pissed off 'cause that was her boyfriend and she was just kind of screaming and he was about to knock her out. So that was a little bit high tension. Had to break that up and call cops about it. Um, I've had experiences with someone that has a really hard time communicating and that they can't really have a genuine conversation with you because they can't get around their own. Just very self-oriented, kind of selfish in a way. You can't really have a two person conversation because they don't move past a certain point in their mind.

And the little finger I run back to the hu I didn't even know, go back to the huddle. And I'm standing there and I'm looking down and here's the finger sticking out and the big white bone sticking out side of the finger. Uh, well this is not good. Uh, and this was in high school and back then, uh, uh, they had to go to a school nurse first for anything. And so then she took a look at it and obviously sent me to the school. Doctor.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    Doctor said it, it was just, it wasn't broken, it was just dislocated. And he just pulled it out and pushed it back together and put a big splint on it. Fine. And two weeks, whenever it went by. And I go to the doctor, uh, and the doctor says, well, now you have, we have to start bending this finger because otherwise it will get stiff. So I stick my hand out there and he bends it and I'm going through the roof. I mean, this is, this is not a good thing, you know? Oh, come on. He says, come on, this is, this can't be hurting that much, you know? Uh, go on, we gotta bend it one more time. I, one more time. I stick my hand out there and, and, and he's going nuts 'cause he's mad because, I mean, this is hurting, but he, he's not having that. So he puts the baggy back on and says, we'll come back in a week and we'll look at him. We clear, come back. And he said, well, we gotta bend your finger again. Stick it out there.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:00    Nope, not doing one more time. I said, I said, I'm not sticking my finger out there again. We're not bending that finger anymore. And he just threw all this stuff down and disgusted and said, well get out here and find. So by now, now I, I've, I'm at the University of Iowa, so I go to student health over there and they send me to the, uh, orthopedic, uh, group there. And they determine, well, there's nothing they can do. The bones are laying side by side. They've been laying side by side for so long that all they can do is cut the knuckle out and pin it back together. So they have a little shorter finger and they put a little curve in it. Uh, and as it turns out, I believe it would've been a lot better if I just had 'em cut it off. Uh, because when you make a fist roll, you little,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    I can't bend that finger. So you don't have a lot of strength in that finger either. I think if they'd have cut that off, I'd have had a lot more strength. And it's just favoring that finger so much over the years. I think that's what's causing my writing problems and screwed up my muscles in my hand. But that's the only major. It's a really major accident.

I mean there's really just, um, usually a small store, a post office and houses.

And my husband and I decided that one of us should go to help her and to help her with her husband. And I arrived hoping that I could do something to get them counseling, whatever. Within 24 hours he had called the police of Rome. I was alone with him and the house and I had no help. And I didn't know how to get ahold of my daughter and the police were coming to get me 'cause he was trying to get me in jail. And I immediately thought, I wonder if I can take my pillow or should I take my Sudoku game? Because if I have to sit in that police with the police in jail, what am I going to do?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    So I sort of, you know, and then I started trying to call my daughter's friends, finding out how I can get ahold of Susan.

I finally got a hold of my daughter and she came and we called the Carbone, and the Carbone came to help me. And I'm not sure if I was afraid, I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail. And I was willing to fight for everything I was worth to make it happen my way.

He was well enough to come to the wedding and he was, he was the best man for my husband at the wedding.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:39    So rather than being just the father of the groom, he stood by my husband.

We stood at that altar and simply sobbed while we said our vows to one another. I mean, it was just so emotional. We just, we just stood there and sobbed with one another.

It looks like they, before they tried, before they called the firemen, they tried to maybe use a ladder, but it looks like it was too short. Um, and um, after they called the firemen, the firemen came in and they are going to get the cat down and get the, the man down who was run up by the dog. And everyone will go home and be happy.

If they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. So that's another way that an out can be generated. Um, let's see. Um, the way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first, second, third, and then touches back onto home plate, that's one point or one run. Um, I just mentioned that there's a field beyond the diamond. There's usually a fence behind that. Those, those players that are in the outfield, it's called the outfield. Um, if the batter hits the ball over that outer fence, then it's a home run. And so he gets a free unimpeded trip around from each base. And that's a point if the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around and he scores a point and then the batter gets a point.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:58    So it's a two run home run. So you, um, you try to get more points or runs before you are, all of your 27 outs are exhausted. Um, if you are taught, if both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning, then it's a kind of a sudden death. Like whoever gets the most runs, where both teams equally have a chance to score runs. Um, after that, um, they win the game. So if you, if you're tied in the ninth and then the visiting team comes up first, 'cause they start the, the game, they start batting, they score a run, they get, then they get three outs, the other team doesn't score. They get their chance, they get three outs with no runs, then the visiting team has won the game. There's no time. The, the games can conceivably last forever.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:48    Um, they, the, the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points. Um, some of the strategies that people employ are, um, you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball. And there's different types of pitchers. There's some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball, curb in the air somehow. Um, and then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So, 'cause if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm, can throw the ball to first base, and before that batter gets there, then they're, they're, they're valuable. Um, for the offensive team, um, some skills that you want is, you want someone that is strong, that has really good hand-eye coordination and, uh, that that can hit the ball far and hard. Um, some specialized players are, they're, they're skilled at speed. So  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    If you have someone that is marginal hitting but he's fast, um, and they can hit the ball and then, but they're fast the first base and can get there before the other team is, um, is able to get the ball, then, then, then that's, um, that's a valuable, valuable position as well.

Uh, while she's cleaning, she overhears her stepmother, uh, reading an invitation to her sister's that there's going to be a big royal ball at the castle that weekend. Um, Cinderella is very excited while she's cleaning the attic. Um, she notices a book of spells in a treasure chest, and she uses that book to wish for a dress.

And, um, stepmother looks at Cinderella like she was a bad dream or something. At any rate, you could tell from her face that she wasn't going to be a very kind stepmother. So right away she put Cinderella to work, waiting on everybody and doing everything. In the book that I knew when I was a child, she cleaned out senders from the fireplace, but, uh, they don't do that anymore. But, uh, she waited on everybody. She was a servant, and the girls were top drawer in the house. And, um, there is a picture in that book that looks as if maybe it's the King Rand and raving because his son needs to have a wife. So they have a ball.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    And the general idea is to introduce the prince to the eligible young ladies. And the two stepdaughters get all dressed up and get ready to go. Cinderella is not going to be allowed to go. And, um, while everything is going on the ball and everything, there's a little cute little plump lady who turns out to be the, uh, fairy godmother. Um, comes and, and tells, uh, Cinderella that they're to go up in the attic and she will find a dress that, uh, she can wear and go to the ball. So Cinderella goes up in the attic, she gets the dress. This fairy godmother makes a coach out of a pumpkin, and she makes horses outta mice. And off Cinderella goes to the ball.

And the stepmother is sitting there thinking for sure her daughters are going to be, are gonna fit the slipper, but they don't. And suddenly the guy says, well, we haven't tried Cinderella yet. This young lady and  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The stepmother looks horrified that Cinderella would even be considered, but they try the slipper on her foot and it fits perfectly, and that's the one that the Prince is looking for.

Um, okay. So I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator. Um, she would hold things in and, you know, you could just feel the energy that she was upset, but, um, she would talk about it. I asked her on numerous occasions to, you know, if we could talk about it if something was bothering her. She always said no. Um, and then, um, she kind of passively aggressively started, you know, not participating in things or, you know, just kind of being rude, I guess, <laugh>. So it finally, you know, broke my last little straw and I yelled at her one day and kicked her out of the group. So <laugh>, that's what I did about it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    Okay. Well, I'm afraid of heights, even little heights, even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder. So I decided, uh, one year to get my boyfriend, uh, skydiving. Um, you know, thing, you know, a jump, I guess that's what you call it, a jump for his birthday. And then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too, and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights. So we went skydiving and it was terrifying. And when I, when we jumped out of the plane, you know, you're attached to someone else. So when we jumped out of the plane and we were free falling, I stopped breathing for like, an entire minute, <laugh>, while we were free falling, because I was just like, so terrified. Um, and then the parachute opens, and then you start gliding, which is kind of nice. That was, that was better. That was a little bit more like being a bird, you know, and flying. Um, so that was nice for a little bit. And then we landed, and then that was that. And I said, I'm glad I did it, and I'll never do it again. <laugh>. And I'm still afraid of heights, <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:02    Um, so the story starts with the flood. There's lots and lots of rain, which is flooding out the city. And the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat, um, to save her cat from the flood and the rains. So she got caught in the flood. She got swept downstream, and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out. And she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her. Um, someone saw her called the fire department, and now the, the firemen are there and one of them has made his way out to the water with the life vest on and is probably gonna try and strap her to him. I think that's what that looks like, uh, to get her out of the water. And that's the end. Okay. The boy is playing soccer outside.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    He kicks the ball really hard. It goes crashing into the window. Um, it crashes through the window into the lamps that's next to the man sitting there.

Um, I was having problems, uh, digesting food, and I was having problems with my bite, uh, eating because my, uh, teeth were moving around. And so anyway, they, I went and they suggested that I have my jaw reset, and they did. And that was quite interesting. We were in San Antonio, Texas at the time, and we were, I went to Fort San. I wasn't in the military, but I went to Fort Sam Houston Hospital for the surgery to set my jaw back. And this was in the sixties, and this was just after we had landed on the moon.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And, um, well, not just after, but a few years afterwards. But anyway, uh, they had come up with a lot of new surgical techniques in dental, uh, area. Not just that area, but all other areas too. But the one thing they came up with the, anytime they deal with, uh, surgical procedures with the teeth or the mouth or anything like that, uh, it's very, uh, can become very infectious. So they found a procedure where they put you under water and do the, uh, surgery. I don't remember being underwater, but I do remember when I came out the surgery they had done, because they had moved my jaw back some, and of course they had wired, my jaw closed, my mouth closed, and, uh, had me all stitched up and everything and took about six or eight weeks before, um, they could take the wires outta my jaw and it so that I could eat normally.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:21    But we had a, during that time we had a, uh, deal where my family and I always went out to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. And uh, we did it just about every Friday night. We told the gal who ran the restaurant, we became, uh, friends of hers and told her that I was gonna have this surgery and stuff and I wouldn't be able to eat. They're gonna wire my jaw. And she said, well, don't worry about it. She said, I'll just go ahead and take your meal and make you a Mexican milkshake. And she did <laugh>, she put it in a blender and added some milk and put it in like a milkshake cup. And I drank it. I could take food through a straw and, uh, I couldn't chew food.

Well, I think, um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:15    I think oddly enough, uh, I, of meeting and, and continuing a life with Joe, it was, um, I'm sure the most important thing that ever happened. Um, the most memorable day was the day our son was born. But I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how, how interesting that all was, we were students at Montclair State, and in those days, freshmen still had to wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures. And in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus, we had to sing the, the alma mater. But the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at, at Life Hall, and he noticed the sign and said something about, I think how part of it was covered. And he said, are you a speech major? And I said, no, English, and I un unveiled the, the words English, but he was a senior and I was a freshman.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:13    And so I got to meet one of the, you know, the upperclassmen got his signature. And then later, um, we just had, it was an easy conversation. We just, we talked a little, he, he continued, um, when I, whenever I saw him to say hi, and, and people were telling me he's A B M O C, you know, he's a, he was a, a vice president of student government. And I said, oh my goodness. But the more we had to talk about it, I was a student leader in my high school. And I thought when he, when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee, <laugh>, it turned out that he, we, he was interested. So our first date, I think was the, something like the Kingston Trio or something like that, some folk group. It was really nice. They were on campus, <laugh> and Joe had probably arranged for them to come.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:58    That was one of his duties. But when I just think of how all that unfolded, just, uh, I knew I, I was gonna finish school. And so we, we paced ourselves, I guess, you know, to, to be logical about things, get to know each other, no surprises, uh, along the way because you have time with the person and you, you see them in all the seasons and all. But I think when it finally came to, to getting married, um, I don't think there was a formal, we people ask us about, this was not even a formal proposal. I think everyone around us assumed we were marry, so we did <laugh>. And so I, I wasn't engaged, you know, I was pinned and someone said to me the next day, you know, you're, you're engaged to be engaged. I said, no, I'm not. And they said, well, that's what that means.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:42    And I said, oh, I thought it meant sort of going steady college style. They said, no, you're engaged to be engaged. And I said, well, we have some time to go. Before I said, it means what it means to the individual couple too. So I tried to assert myself, but I guess it might've been right, but I, I don't care. It didn't mean anything. But that, when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross miss, it's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married and all that happened at once.

But, uh, she, uh, wore some of her stepsister's clothes and, and, um, and anyway, that wasn't appropriate.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    And when, when they saw that she was there, um, they started taking her jewelry away from her and, and tearing her sashes off and that kind of thing.

And, um, she turned a, a pumpkin into a, a, a chariot. And I think she turned mice into the horsemen, or the horses <laugh>, and I forget who she turned into the driver.

Um, the next, the baby is sitting in the middle of the floor with the butter and the red and the red jar and the Hershey syrup and the bottle of milk. It is now four o'clock in the afternoon and the kitchen floor is pretty much of a mess. And so is the baby with chocolate all, all over him. All over the floor.

And they pretty much just made her into a little servant. She was very unhappy, but she didn't really know what else to do. There's nothing else she could do. Then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son, the prince who was, uh, they were trying to find a suitable bride for him. So they were giving a ball and inviting all of the white boy, the area.

So they went to the ball. She was very sad, sitting among the cinders and her, um, very godmother, shows up, appears and tells her she'll get her all set for the ball. So she gives her a beautiful gown and turns a little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses. And I forget what she made her dress out of. So she goes to the ball and she gives her these beautiful glass slippers. So she goes to the ball and she meets the prince. And the prince falls madly in love with her 'cause she's the most beautiful girl there. But the fairy godmother had warned her at midnight, everything would turn back to what it was. So she saw midnight approaching. So she had to leave. Suddenly. The prince, you know, she had to run away from him and hide and run away and jump in her carriage.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:31    And just as she got back, she jumped out of the carriage and everything turned back to what it was before. So she thought, well, that's gonna be my one night of happiness, but I'll always remember it. But the pri she had left behind the way she was running out of the, the castle she had left behind her glass slipper. And Prince had run, been running around trying to find her. And that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper. So he told, um, his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper. So they went around to all the villages and they, they had them try, had the women like possibly be of the, the Cinderella try on the glass slipper. So they got to the house of Cinderella and they asked her, how many girls do you have?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:13    No, I only have two. 'cause they had found out what was going on that they were having to try on this glass slipper. So she hid Cinderella for Cinderella, stay inside her room.

And she took a knife and cut off on the heel, but it still didn't fit. They tried on the, for the second one, and, but her toe was too big. And the mother said, no, no, it fits. And she cut off her toe in secret, but it still didn't fit. So they said, no, this isn't her. These aren't their shoes. So then they were leaving and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there. I, I don't remember exactly what clued them into that. So they insisted on looking around and they found Cinderella and sure enough they tried her, the shoe on her and it fit.

But, uh, when daddy went away, he was, apparently, he traveled in his work some way, at least he went away and left Ella with the stepmother and the two stepsisters. And she, uh, made Cinderella do all the work and sleep in this, the fire by the fireplace and sit by the cinder. So they called her Cinderella and she had to wait on the daughters. And, uh, in the Disney version, which is the book, uh, the little mice came around and they helped her, and the birds came and helped her with her work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    She was, uh, very loved by all the animals.

And, uh, Cinderella had to get 'em ready and she wanted to go, but the stepmother said no, unless she could, uh, manage everything on her own, would be the only way she could go. So she, the little birds and the animals came to her rescue and they helped her make a dress and everything.

And all of a sudden the clock began to strike and she took off and she had to run to get away. And she dropped a slipper on the stairs. And the other stepsisters were so disappointed because the prince didn't pay attention to them, that only the strange princess that nobody knew. So a day or so later, the prince went from house to house with the slipper, trying to find the girl that could wear it. And some of the, the stepsisters tried it on, but they couldn't get their foot into it. I think even the stepmother tried to get it on and she couldn't get her foot in it. And so Cinderella asked if she might try it, and they let her, and her little foot slipped right in, and she reached in her pocket and took out the other shoe and put it on.

I mean, and um, which is not too bad except that iodine really messes your system up that they put into do what they call a contrast when they do the CAT scan And um, the chemo. Um, there's on the pill form on this particular prescription, the major side effects, I didn't want nausea. That's, but it's, uh, mouth sores and your palms of your hands in the bottom of your feet blister. So I just told the oncologist I wasn't having any part of that. He didn't want it. He just kind of looked at me, but I didn't have that. And, uh, I think there's something called Mind Over matter and I just decided I wasn't gonna deal with it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:10    Uh, one of the big side effects of all chemotherapy is fatigue. And, um, another thing which is I really didn't have that until like the last, went to a family reunion in, in September and, uh, kind of wore me out, but then the fatigue hit and once it hit, it was really, really bad. And then I had, um, I have little arthritis anyway, but I had severe, uh, joint pain and muscle ache. Um, but all in all, um, can't complain about that. I mean, it could have been much worse and I just was lucky that they found it. So I think the real answer to, uh, getting better is all attitude. If you don't have a good attitude, um, it's gonna take you a. \n"}, {"job_id": "XuOlkAaeuJVvXQjv", "filename": "NEURAL39-1_266542_455433.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    There wasn't much I could do to help communicate with them.

Okay, here we go.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:34    Well, when I was young I speculate I should know, but I speculate. I was about eight and my friend and I, back in those days, you could walk the neighborhood. Um, she lived a pretty good ways, um, but it was still a neighborhood and she was on her bike and I was walking behind her and then she decided it would get us to her house faster if I rode on the back of the seat with her. So I hopped on the seat and she started peddling, but my foot, my heel got caught in the spoke of the wheel as the wheel was spinning and almost cut my heel off. So she rode ahead to her house and I was walking. Um, as she had gone on to her house, I was walking and all the cars that were passing thought I was crying 'cause she had stolen my bike.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:38    So I finally said, nobody stopped to help me, but finally got to her house and her parents weren't home. So we called my mom and my grandmother was there too. And they came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. And in the waiting room, a man came up to me to show me that his, um, head had a fishing hook in it and that mine was worse than his and I should be proud. But I remember this old man with a fishing hook hanging out of his head. So I got stitched up and I was fine.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:16    I'd like you to look at all these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:23    Looks like there's a little boy who's just hanging out by himself playing soccer.

And to be kind of a maid for the ugly two mean ladies, mean daughters. And Cinderella would look at the castle and dream and think of her Prince Charming. And in that castle, um, they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a girlfriend for the, for Prince Charming. So they sent out invitations and they, uh, Cinderella got one, but their, her stepsisters wouldn't let her go. They were gonna go instead.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:13    But Cinderella called on a fairy godmother and she dressed Cinderella. It's just so beautiful. And mice and the birds all helped. And Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass slippers. And, but the fairy godmother says, you better be careful because at midnight all this goes away. You, you go back to being Cinderella, so you have to get everything done by midnight. So sure enough, she met Prince Charming and Prince Charming just went head over heels over this lovely Cinderella with, and they danced. And they danced. And the danced and bang, 12 o'clock came and Cinderella had to run and leave because she turned back to whatever she was before. And she was afraid. Prince Charming would not like that. So she ran away, and as she was running away, she drops one of her glass slippers and leaves it laying there. But she goes back and suddenly she becomes Cinderella again.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:18    And the Prince Charming is so sad that his lovely Cinderella was gone and he couldn't find her. So he assigns a bunch of people with a glass slipper that he found to go around his kingdom and try on this glass slipper to find the girl that it fit. And so first he went and went and they searched and searched and couldn't go. And they went to Cinderella's house and they tried the glass slipper on both of his step mean stepsisters. And they tried to get the shoe on, tried to get the shoe on, and it didn't fit. And they saw Cinderella over there in the corner and they said, come over here. We'll try you too.

Um, and he's a little embarrassed that he's at home now wet. And he says, I guess I needed that umbrella. And mom's a little disappointed in him. So now he's going off to school with the umbrella, hopefully in dry clothes. That's all.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:52    So please look at everything that's happening in this picture and tell me a story about what you see. And we'd like the story to have the beginning, a middle and an end. And you may,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:09    Okay, so the little girl was, uh, sitting on the porch board and she heard a bird sing. And when I didn't see the bird that was singing, she didn't see it. So she walked toward a tree toward the sound of the bird singing. And while she was there, she saw the cat. And even though the cat is just sleeping, she wanted to bring the cat down from the tree. So, oh yeah. So the, actually the dog chased the cat up the tree <laugh>. So while the bird was singing and the girl was sitting on the porch, the dog had found the cat and chased the cat up the tree. That's why the dog was there. And, but she still followed. She didn't see any of that. She just wanted to see the bird and then saw the, the cat and asked her, oh, she rode her tricycle over to see the cat.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:21    Um, so she asked, she tried to rescue the cat, but couldn't, she tried to stand up on her tricycle and didn't, didn't work, couldn't reach it.

He went and he climbed up the tree with the ladder, and then the ladder fell and the little girl's too young to pick up the ladder. So he stuck and the cat stuck or there.

So now I want you to take a look at that set of pictures. Okay. And, um, you can see that they tell a story and I just want you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:23    Okay. Um, once upon a time, there was a little boy, he, he was getting ready to go to school and his mother came and said, before you go to school, you need to, uh, take your umbrella because it's supposed to rain today. The weatherman said it was supposed to rain. And the little boy said, I don't want to take the umbrella to school. None of the other kids took their umbrellas to school. And so, um, he finally talked her into, I don't want to take the umbrella. And she finally said, okay, but if it rains, you're gonna get wet. So I don't want to hear any complaints. So he makes it about halfway to school. And guess what? It starts raining and then it starts raining even harder and he has to run back through the puddles in the rain to his house. And he comes back and he is absolutely soaked from head to toe. And the mother says, well, and he said, I should've listened to you. I should've taken the umbrella. So she dries him off, she gives him the umbrella and he heads back to school. But this time he's, he's dry all the way to school under the umbrella, even in the rainstorm.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:24    Okay, great. So now we have two more short stories. So there's, um, this sequence of pictures mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I just want you to again, look at the pictures they tell a story and, um, tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:39    Okay. So, uh, a young boy lived in the neighborhood and loved soccer and he was constantly kicking a soccer ball around his yard and down on the street and everywhere he went. And one day he was going down the sidewalk and he kicked the soccer ball and it bounced off the side of his foot, right through the plate glass window of one of his neighbor's home. So his neighbor was sitting, watching TV at his house and crash. Here comes this soccer ball through the window. And, uh, so he was upset about it and he picks the ball up and he looks out the window and sees the boy. And, uh, the boy is just very apologetic and says that he'll mow the man's lawn or clean his garage or clean his attic to, to make up for the cost of the broken window. And, uh, so the man said that he would just hold his ball until all that was done and the window was replaced and they made their deal. And that was that.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:41    Okay, great. I'll take that. Okay. Now the last story that I want you to tell me, um, it's a little bit different. I just want you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:52    Alright, well you, you start by removing two slices of bread from, uh, the, the loaf. Lay them both flat, face down, open. Take, uh, a jar of peanut butter.

Uh, this goes on for years as they get older, the, the kings, the prince of the land is time to be married and about the same age as these three young women now. And so he invites all the people in the land to a big ball. The stepmother and her daughters have spent hours, days getting prepared for this, and Cinderella's not been invited. The, uh, as the ball approaches, the stepsisters go off the ball and Cinderella has left at home without anything. No. The, uh, somehow <laugh>, a fairy godmother comes, enters the story and turns some mice into horses and punking into a carriage, and all comes up with a big, beautiful gown for Cinderella to wear  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:06    With  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    Glass slippers.

You often hear about a cat gets stuck up in the tree and the little girl has tried to get the cat to come down and he won't. And the dog barking at the base of the tree isn't helping anything. And then the father got involved and he said, I can climb up and get the cat for you. But he got up in the tree and the branch started to wiggle and wobble and he got scared. So the mother looking out of a window in the house, probably called the firetruck to come and get the cat. Well, I've never been really sick. I've never broken a bone, haven't been hospitalized. But I did have breast cancer twice. That was, I have to remember, uh, it was first diagnosed in January, I think that was of 94. And the doctor did a lumpectomy. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> outpatient. And that was worked well. And then they put me on, they tested to see what all the,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:35    What kind of cancer it is. So they put me on, uh, radiation and first it was chemo, then radiation. And then they gave me follow-up tests for different things, but nothing showed up. So they followed me as far as exams went. And three years later I went to the radiologist. And in his examination he said, my goodness, I feel a lump. It's just where the other one was. So he was in the same building as a surgeon. So I call, they called up and the surgeon could see me. So he looked at and he said, oh my goodness. So I guess within three or four days I had a mastectomy and that was outpatient. And what they decided to do after that was put me on, oh, it's a drug. They don't use any tamoxifen. So I was on Tamoxifen for five years and I was glad to get off of that. And since then I have had no signs of cancer. And for a while they thought it was in my lungs and they did a lot of testing, but it wasn't, and then they thought, oh, it's in my thyroid. And they had some complicated tests, but it wasn't, and I haven't had any problems. \n"}, {"job_id": "7vj6gdL5ev0IvyCy", "filename": "NEURAL6-1_23925_210821.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Um, uh, three years ago, uh, I had been, uh, visiting my daughter in Ohio and came back, um, and was feeling kind of sick.

So, um, I was trying to get to my medicine and, uh, that usually calms it down. And in the process of doing that, uh, unfortunately I was standing up getting, trying to find my purse and pass out right then so that I went down flat bang on the, uh, hardwood floor. And apparently I was unconscious. My husband, of course, heard the fall and I was unconscious enough to scare him. So he called, uh, the EMTs and, uh, by the time when they, I woke up when they were already there and, um, uh, no, I'm sorry, I didn't actually, I woke up before they came and I was saying, I'm fine.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    I'm fine. Don't you know, da da da. So, um, they convinced me. They, I, they convinced me that I should probably go to the ER in case it was something more than what I thought it was. And so I did. And, uh, so I got to the er and the doctor there, of course, did whatever they do in far, in terms of diagnosing what had happened. And among other things, I had a, an M R i, I think, or CAT scan, I can't remember. And, um, it ended up showing that I had pancreatitis, which was totally undiagnosed. And totally after I found out later talking to a doctor about it had nothing to do whatsoever with my symptoms. So I just accidentally got diagnosed with pancreatitis. Um, spent a couple of days in the hospital. Meantime, my head had a huge lump on it and my hip from falling.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:06    And nobody, any doctor said one word to me about that. I was so completely kind of out of it that I didn't recognize what was going on. Why did I have these lumps? And finally, so anyway, a couple days later, they told me I could go home from the pancreatitis. And I said, so what the heck is the deal with this <laugh>? And it turned out, of course, I probably did have a, a concussion, uh, but it wasn't apparently serious. And so that's good. So anyway, I went home under the instructions not to drink alcohol ever again in my whole life. And I enjoyed wine, a great deal. And so, but I absolutely at that point stopped drinking, uh, entirely and haven't had any real, uh, uh, reason to, to try to, I I have a complete and utter total fear of drinking at this point, actually.

That was a very unique take on these pictures. Look at everything that's happening in this picture, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And I'll say it to start, and then I will mute myself so that I don't make any noise to interrupt. Okay? Okay. All right. So Mitchell, where's my mute button? Come here.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    What we're seeing is what happened in my neighborhood about, I would say about a year ago. It was a very peaceful afternoon, and Daisy was playing with her cat, kitty. Cat and kitty cat decided to climb the tree, and Daisy wanted to bring the cat down, or wanted to get the cat to come back, but the cat would not go down. So therefore, her dad decided to rescue the cat. And he went up as far as the first branch where you see him sitting down, and then it was in total distress. So they, in, in the meantime, our dog, uh, Cooper started to bark at my dad. 'cause some days' brother. And so Cooper started to bark at that because Cooper wanted dad to come back, wanted Daisy, wanted the cat to come back. Cooper wanted my dad to come back off a tree. And I had the, the cold mind and, and criteria.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    'cause my mother was all up in arms and she was running like a chicken with his head cut off and not knowing what to do. So it had to, they had to rely on me and say, look, this is the situation to call the fire brigade. No one can help us. I'm not gonna climb retreat. I'm very bad at climbing trees. I hate the cat on the other hand, so I'm not gonna rescue the cat. And I, I want to cooper to feel better. I, I mean, I have a stronger relationship to Cooper than to anybody else in this picture, including the bird. I hate birds and I hate cats, but I, I, I like my dad and I like my sisters, sort of, but even though I hate the cat, so I call the fire brigade. And so the fire brigade eventually came and rescued the cat, helped my dad to come back.

He was still nauseated, didn't feel good, knew something was wrong. We got over there Oh, and he was, he was, uh, like he's about to vomit. So we took a container over to the, to the walk-in clinic. And, uh, I registered him and we sat there maybe 20 minutes. My husband was getting sicker and sicker still. They didn't call us back. So I went up to the counter and I asked if there was a doctor in the building. Told him my husband was really sick. Well, maybe five minutes later, they finally got us back to an examining room. The doctor started talking about, uh, indigestion. And since my husband has had, uh, stomach problems, he knew what indigestion was. He said, no, it isn't indigestion. And the doctor was a foreign doctor, did not speak English good. And finally she asked him, said, well, what do you think's wrong with you? He said, I'm beginning to think it's my heart. So she ordered an E K G, and they immediately, as soon as that E K G came out, called the ambulance and told me he was having a heart attack and transferred him to Central Baptist Hospital. That was, that was a very, very trying time. \n"}, {"job_id": "WFBhGBUwN923BFGL", "filename": "wright39a_1037935_1223350.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And Cinderella knows she must say goodbye.

Um, all four of them are really excited, but, um, Cinderella obviously is not supposed to go. And so she sneaks off and finds a book and decides to sew her own dress with the help of the mice and the other animals. Um, but when she puts it on the evil stepsisters and the stepmother make fun of the dress and rip it off of her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    Um, so she goes and cries at a bench, and this woman appears, who is her fairy godmother, who grants her wishes to have a, to go to the ball by giving her, turning all of the animals, the mice and the, the horse and the dog into, um, horses and a chariot and gives her a dress and glass slippers. But at midnight, the spell wears off. So she goes to the ball, she dances with the prince, and then the stepsisters and stepmother, um, recognize her and get upset and see that she's dancing with the prince. She realizes she has to go home. So she runs off and the prince is like, no, don't leave. And so as she's running away, her slipper falls off and the prince takes the slipper.

I'm gonna have you, um, tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is if I've never made one before. Good  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:26    Boy. Okay. So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need two slices of bread, um, and then a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly and a knife. So first you lay the two pieces of bread out, and then you open the jar of peanut butter and using the knife, take some peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread, of one slice of bread. And then you open the jar of jelly and you take the knife and you spread jelly on either on top of the peanut butter on the one slice, or you could put it on the other slice, but only on one side. And then you take the two sides that have the peanut butter and jelly, and you put them together so that there's clean bread on the outside. And that's it. \n"}, {"job_id": "bNtnRbYpzSAx6x1L", "filename": "NEURAL20-1_26452_211367.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:04    Well, let's see. Hmm. Alright, well, there was a period of time when I was approximately 48, 49 years old when I began having a series of lung collapses and what a mysterious thing this was. But it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual period. And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor and I was sent to the ER for x-rays for this lung collapse. And, um, it was never complete. It was only about 15 to 20% of my, it was always my right lung. And so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse and I spent some time trying to figure out what on earth could this be? And finally I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And at the start of each menstrual period, I think it is bleeding, breaking and bleeding into my pleural cavity because I have found 69 examples of, or I have, I found a study who reported 69 other PE women who have had a similar situation. And the doctor said, well, you might be right. We'll send you to a surgeon. So I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery. I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery and we'll see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had, um, holon and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm, but instead he, um, cemented the top part of my right lung to the cavity that holds it in place so that the next time I would have a bleed into this area, if that's what it was, in fact, my lung would not fall down and create a partial collapse.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:24    So that's what happened. Um, after that I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened, but I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end, the surgeon said, well, I guess that's, that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis that bled into the pleural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of, of a type such that I would no longer have menstrual periods. And it all turned out happily ever after. I had no further lung collapses. \n"}, {"job_id": "vp7pmNs8ZdVasnl2", "filename": "richardson58_311895_496716.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay, so Cinderella was she, her dad ended up marrying, um, another woman, her stepmother.

And, um, just gave her rags to wear and made her clean, clean the whole house all the time and do all the chores.

Um, so the evil stepsisters, um, that's what they call them, uh, get ready to go to the ball, and Cinderella remains behind.

She leaves behind a slipper, the prince finds it, um, and goes then after that, searching for the girl whose glass slipper it is. Um, it is discovered that it fits Cinderella, even though the evil stepsisters try it on. Um, and it's a terrible thing in the original. They cut their own feet, their own toes off to make the shoe fit anyway, um, the shoe fits her, and Cinderella and the Prince get married and live happily every after supposedly <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:19    And last language prompt.

So then I would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread. I do like my peanut butter first, so I would pull out a knife and I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread.

So somebody came out and, uh, the um, men, uh, were not happy to see this possum either. 'cause he really looked mean and they took off the vent and somehow they caught him.

Um, my husband and I, when we first started dating, he was involved in a group, um, that did medieval reenactment and part of their, um, events and, um, group gatherings involved a, a large gathering where, um, the people could take on personas of warriors and they would dress up in, you know, armor and things like that and go out and meet each other with sticks and stuff. You know, no real swords or anything like that. That's not legal. But, um, you know, like I said, it was a reenactment. And at one point during, um, a battle, at this particular battle, he was, um, basically tackled by several members, which isn't usual. And when he fell, he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor. But they decided to step over him and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids and it wrenched his neck around.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:27    They had to call the paramedics, um, from a nearby, um, emergency center. And we were out on the outskirts of town, out on the, the countryside Phoenix, west Phoenix. And so the closest place was several miles away and they called the ambulance. They came out, put the neck brace on, loaded him. He was in a lot of pain. I was freaking out. I didn't know what was going on. I heard things like convulsions. I heard neck broken. I heard just, it was craziness. So they loaded him up on the ambulance. I ran back for, to my tent 'cause I was out there camping with him, grabbed my car keys and hopped in the, the car we had taken together. And, uh, met him at the emergency room. When I got there, they had him in the x-ray taking x-rays of his neck. Turns out he did not break his neck, which was a great relief. But, um, he was pretty badly bruised and banged up. He had severe, you know, neck, you know, whiplash and, and strain and was put on all sorts of pain medications and things like that. I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was, but that time in between, you know, what happened and finding out from the doctors was I, yeah, I was off the charts. What do you do with that? You have no idea.

And then the letter comes and it's about going to the ball to get to dance with the prince and maybe find him a wife.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    And so Cinderella starts making herself a dress and she uses a book and she gets it all together.

So you'll have two slices of bread, and you'll take your knife or your spoon and you'll get some peanut butter and you'll spread it on the slice.

And he had a ladder, but he didn't take the ladder. He just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch. But he's stuck there now because he can't get to him. Otherwise, that branch will break and then he'll hurt himself. In the meantime, the little girl's dog comes and he's barking and barking. What are you doing up there? Come on down. I can't come up there. Another bird is taking this all in, but he's singing, he's on another branch on the opposite side, and he's still happy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:48    But lo and behold, we had see two firemen with a large ladder running toward the man because they're gonna get the man out and certainly the cat off the branch. So they're parked and they're going in the back. But the thing is, the man should have taken the ladder and gone up safely, not the, what he tried to do by himself. And the girl will get her cat back because the firemen are going to get the cat down and gonna get the man down. And the little bird, he'll just stay there because he's not gonna be bothered.

She goes on a tricycle, she's gonna go home with the cat, make sure he's all right, and a dog will follow. And the story is when you have your tools, make sure you use them first. I need whole wheat bread, and there's a special bread that I like. It's called 17 grain bread. So I get the bread, I'll get two slices, I get peanut butter and I like it with the nuts in it.

And you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesn't dry out. And if there's only two of you in the house, you don't go through a loaf of bread a day. So it's important to keep it fresh. So you keep the bread in the freezer. So go to the freezer, grab the loaf of bread, take it out. Untwist the twist tie. Take out two slices of bread, put the twist tie back on, put the bread back in the freezer. Close the door. Uh, grab a plate out of the uh cupboard and get a knife out of the silverware drawer. I go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter. Uh, bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:42    Go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly. Put the jar of jelly on the counter. Uh, open up the peanut butter. Take a knife. Um, grab some peanut butter on the knife. Spread it on the bread. Um, put the, put the uh, peanut butter on the whole slice of bread on one side and put the lid back on the peanut butter. Open up the jar of jelly. Uh, take the knife and take the other slice of bread and spread the jelly on the second slice. You never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter 'cause it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with. So put the, put the jelly on the other slice of bread and you find it because the bread is frozen, it's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly. After you've spread the peanut, uh, butter and the jelly.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:31    Slap the two slides together. Turn 'em over like this. Cut 'em in half or quarters. You can cut on the diagonal, you can cut crosswise, you can cut vertical. You can cut 'em into as many pieces as you want. If you have a five year old grandson, you cut 'em into about eight pieces After you've, um, cut it. Now you gotta put the, uh, peanut butter back in the cupboard, put the jelly back in the refrigerator and put the knife in the dishwasher. And then go get a glass. Pour yourself a glass of milk.

Somehow or other, the firemen found out about it and they've come and they've got a ladder and they're gonna come over and set the ladder up and get dad out of the tree.

If it looks like it would go with what you have, you take it and you put it in. Then you have to discard one of your cards. 'cause you never have more than seven cards in your hand. And then it's my turn. If I want the card that you discarded, I can take that and then I discard one. If you want the one that I just discarded, you can take that. We go back and forth and back and forth. But eventually one of us is going to want something other than what was put down there.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:32    So you flip the next card over, or you have to take this. If you don't take that, the next card on the deck, you have to take it. It's your turn. Okay? So you go back and forth that way, back and forth, back and forth. Eventually one of us is going to have created a hand of the gym. And so what you'll have is you'll have picked up a card. Let's say it's the one you've been waiting for into your hand. It goes and you've been holding onto this one extra card over here that you really don't need. And you take that card and you put it face down on the pile and you see Jim and the other person screams because they realize that you had the cards. They need it all along. And then the way it's scored is you have to lay your cards out. If you have three of a kind, then you put that over to the side. If you have four in a row, you know, we put that over the side. Anything that you have that's left over that didn't fit into your hand of gin, um, you have to, we, we count up what that card is worth and that goes on your score. And then we play another hand until we get tired of playing the game. And the person with the lowest score. \n"}, {"job_id": "tGNqgWJp9aVw8BJl", "filename": "wright25a_250_174773.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay. While preparing for Tommy's birthday party, their dog's spot jumped up on the, on the table and ate part of the birthday cake running under the couch because the mother was angry with the dog. Spot was hiding under the couch when all of the birthday guests arrived to find the confusion. Tommy was very sad that his dog spot had eaten some of his cake, but he told his guests it was okay, and they had brought him nice gifts and they went to Chuck e Cheese and had a different cake that was better than the first one. The it first you get, uh, two pieces of bread and a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly and a knife.

When I was five years old, I had tonsillitis and had to have my tonsils removed. It was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to, uh, breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become, uh, sore and aggravated. So I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out. The best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better. But afterwards, going home, I had to take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better, which gave me vivid dreams. And I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo. And when I woke up screaming it, my mother had come in to take care of me. And it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake. And apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy.

The most recent one was in New York City. I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt Hospital and um, my right lung had filled up with fluid and um, so they kept me. I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked. The towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower. Uh, they didn't come. So I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel. Um, I have veins that are very difficult to get blood, so I'd always say kiddingly to the people, are you really good at this? And one man named Joe l told me, <laugh>, he was terrific. He'd, he'd, ah, no problem. After about 20 pokes in my hand, I said, could you find someone else to draw blood because we're not getting it done here.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:20    And um, it was really all I could do to get better so I could get out of the place because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid and that facilities, um, are having trouble today, uh, getting the help that they need. I can also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night. Of course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things and she couldn't find the bathroom. So <laugh>, she just used whatever facility she could find. And when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient that's dying. So I was so unaccustomed to hospitals and I'm probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before. And, um, I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there. So that was my experience. That's probably the worst experience I've ever had in the hospital.

And that's really weird for me to do that. So I went to the emergency room and the nurse checked me out and put some, uh, a lubricant in my eye, gave me a pain pill, excuse me. And she called the doctor, and the doctor called what I got home, made arrangements to meet her at the office. So we got down the office and she checked my eye out again with another machine and said it was just a rub mark. It wasn't a scratch or a tear or anything, and the lubricant would work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    So I went, we went, she gave us a prescription for the lubricant. We get down to the drugist and it was for somebody else's name, another patient's name. Well, the first drugstore we went to, it wouldn't cover it. It was a Walgreens, but it's not the Walgreens that we normally go to. And they wouldn't honor the prescription. So they suggested that we get an over the counter lubricant, which wasn't, uh, didn't have any antibiotics in it. So I was reluctant to mix 'em. So we got home, we called the doctor again, and that was, say 12 o'clock, one o'clock. And by the time we finally got a call back from the doctor I had called, had to call twice through a service. When she finally called back, she laughed. She said, oh, I should've known that. So what she did, that was around six o'clock.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:52    So what she did was, uh, called in another prescription to a different Walgreens that's about 30 miles away from home. The wife went back up there again, and unfortunately the doctor had called in. They, yeah, another name, a third name. But it was close enough to the Bridewell name that the drug is there. Recognized my name. They hadn't filled the prescription because they weren't positive, but they held onto the prescription until the wife got there. And then they worked it out. Well, they went on and filled the prescription for us. She brought it back home and, uh, well, I put another dose in there before I went to bed. I took another pill. And when I got up the next morning, it was all but cured. So last night was last night, meaning Sunday night was the last time I took any of the lubricant.

Um, I would like to tell you the story, um, about my grandfather because he was the, one of the most important people in my life when I was a child. And I was, it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten. It was in July. And, um, it was just a normal day. I was a happy, carefree child playing with my friend down the street. And it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom. You, you went out the door and came in for lunch and then you went out the door uhhuh and there really weren't very many parameters. Right. And there were lots of fun adventures to be had. And, um, came home to find out that he had had a, that they didn't use the word stroke, but that's what he had. Um, but he had to go to the hospital from work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:40    And so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying, when grandpa comes home, he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like. I have that feeling of what it felt like, um, to find out that, you know, he wasn't coming home. And just as a child, an innocent child, um, kind of coming to terms with life and death saying Wow. And really being blindsided by the whole thing. Having that be my first experience with death. And, um, you know, I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who, um, was in the nursing home, she was around 'cause she, she couldn't live with us for a while. And it was just, she actually, I remember she slapped me 'cause I was crying so hard.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:23    Oh, wow. Everyone went to, all the adults, went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that. And I was hysterical crying. I was so, so sad. And she didn't know what to do. So she actually slapped me to get me, and it worked. She wasn't being mean, but I was beyond being consoled at that point. And I, I felt very alone in my, um, grief for some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But anyway, that, that, that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future. And I remember a time when, um, I was in sixth grade and we were having a sleepover in my friend's backyard. Happened to be with a, a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots, a girl who lost her young brother to leukemia.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:06    Uh, the other girl had lost her grandmother and I had lost my grandfather. And we, it was like they, they could make a movie about the bond. Wow. We were all in the tent and we were just talking, and I can see us all sitting there and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there. It was probably the safest place Wow. To ever let it go. And we all just, just let it out. And I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this and it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is, is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life, you know, as I grew up. And also as I had mentioned yesterday that, um, I didn't know about angels then, but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe and he can, uh, sort of watch over me, if you will. \n"}, {"job_id": "Vh2FUWvviop42ZTx", "filename": "wright09a_1070027_1243501.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 1    00:00:04    One day a family mouses.

Uh, for a couple of hours we grabbed a bite and meandered, um, prices being what they are. We really didn't buy much, but enjoyed ourselves. Uh, the trip both for Paris and London, the ports are two hours by bus from each of them, so we enjoyed countryside scene.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    Followed day was Paris took a tour of the city and a three hour boat ride on the same. Again, it was our first trip and their first trip to Paris. Again, a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time. Uh, from there we had a day at sea. Enjoyed Lazing around. Um, the ship itself, I would not particularly recommend, but enjoyed being with the people we were with. From there, we've spent a few hours in Vigo, Spain. Haven't figured out yet why they stopped there from, uh, Lisbon. Again, a city we had been to before. Our friends had not enjoyed a tour of the city. Spent some time, uh, meandering in the square, and of course have finding some pastry, my husband's favorite. Um, from there we went to Kadi in Malaga, a very nice city, very friendly people, interesting architect, church back to Genoa and then onto Genoa, where we spent the night and then flew home. We'll leave the airplane trip back in the realm of nightmares, at least from Charlotte to Phoenix on US Air, and don't ever ask me to fly us air again.

But just by carrying that pad around with her all the time, she was able to make lists of things.

And first, you unscrew the lid of the peanut butter jar. Put in the knife, get a nice glob of peanut butter and spread it on one slice. And if you want to contaminate your jelly, you can use the same knife. If not, you might want another knife to spread jelly on the other piece of bread. And once you're done, make sure everything is closed and put back in the fridge and you can put the two slices together and you are done. \n"}, {"job_id": "v0S0r9a4FmjiFql1", "filename": "NEURAL2-1_890927_1058781.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So they could all hear what was happening in there.

We'll try again tomorrow. Tomorrow's Wednesday. So we go through the same thing again, or, no, actually I think I started on Monday, so it was Monday, Tuesday, and then Wednesday. So I was induced three days in a row.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:55    And, and it got like, it seemed to work less every single time, like the, the medicine or whatever it was.

She always, she had to do all the cleaning and all the cooking and all the washing and take care of them, and didn't get treated nicely. And she didn't get to go shelving for new clothes, and she wasn't given the best food to eat. And anyway, she was just treated horribly. One day, uh, the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an invitation from the palace to come to a ball. Cinderella thinking she's a member of the family, thinks she can go along, but she can't. So she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get ready for the ball, and then they go after they leave.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    She's very disappointed because she really wanted to go to the ball and somehow or another, her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she can go to the ball, but she has to be home by midnight.

So Cinderella went to the ball. She had a wonderful time. Nobody knew who she was. Everybody was saying, oh, who's that woman? Who's that woman? The prince danced before the whole evening. She had a lovely time. And then as the clock was striking 12, she realized she had to leave. So she ran out. In running out, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper, made it to the carriage and got home just as the carriage turned into a pumpkin.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    Um, following that, the prince found the missing slipper and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper. So he traveled all over the kingdom, trying the shoe on women's feet to see if it fit. It didn't fit anybody. Finally, he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly stepsisters, and he tried it on their feet. It didn't fit any of them. And he saw Cinderella and said, why don't you try it? Or possibly, she said, why don't I try it? And he tried it on and it fit. And he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after having danced with her for a few hours. And she, of of course, being swept off her feet, agreed to marry him, not understanding what it would mean that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and cooking.

I guess it was Friday.

She managed to keep it on her face this week or last week. Um, so often she, um, but the conversation was the same, which is she's, um, delighted always in the moment and, uh, happy to see me, but cannot follow a conversation very well. Um, forgets what you've asked, actually, I've just stopped asking her questions, but rather, um, sort of prompting her, um, with ideas or words or whatever. Um, sometimes I ask questions, but not all the time.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:16    But, um, she's, her memory is much like, uh, there's just no beginning or end. I think the metaphor I used last week is that she'll look through a series of pictures endlessly and make relatively the same comments. Um, so mostly if she starts talking, um, and she talks less than she used to, um, I'll redirect if she gets into something that is agitating to her or kind of super sad if she keeps repeating it. But that doesn't happen very often. Most of the time she's, um, she kind of discovers a new, that she's talking to people. Like you can see her look away and then she'll look at the screen and kind of, oh, hi, <laugh>, delighted to see you. Um, so she's getting, uh, a little better at at understanding that this, or she seems to be able to remember that she's done something like this before and that she looks, if she looks in a certain place, we can see her, um, and she can see us. Um, and that her, uh, memory has been fading over the last decade. But looking back, I realized she had trouble even before then, but had better coping skills and it was manageable. She made a lot of lists. Um, she relied on my father, who was then still alive to prompt her for things.

Once you got the ingredients and you get out of plate and you put it on the table and you grab two slices of bread, put the bread on the plate, and you open up your jars and you grab one butter knife for your peanut butter and you take, and you spread the peanut butter on both pieces of bread, both pieces. You gotta make sure you eat enough peanut butter. And then you take, and you grab a spoon and you get the jelly and you, I prefer strawberry jam, but you get a nice scoop of jam or jelly on there and you put it on the bread and you smear it out.

I wanted to get into traveling and I had this feeling that I was gonna be called towards, you know, doing meditation more. I've done yoga from a really young age and very blessed, but I had a really, really crazy time in college and I kind of knew that like that chapter was closing and something new was opening, but I was like, I did not work again. And so I was in the HA public library and I swear by it, the book fell off the shelf. Like I didn't touch this book, like this book fell off the shelf. And it was called Spirit Junkie by this woman named Gabrielle Bernstein. And I opened up that book and my whole life changed. After that. She broke down the gift of healing, of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I had never heard of.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:58    And I went to a Catholic school and it was kind of like religion is like politics. It's not for me. And she just opened up this door that you can heal through this, this way of prayer and of asking for help. It was something that was so foreign to me to just ask for help. And so I started doing her writing exercises, I started doing her meditations, like I just threw myself into this lifestyle. I started praying every night. I started praying every morning, and I started noticing that my life was getting lighter, that I was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have before because I was blocking myself. And she was showing me this box, right? So picking up that book and dedicating myself to spirituality and the biggest thing being meditation, she had no, except she wasn't like, oh, you don't really meditate, like do two minutes.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:46    She was like, sit down for five minutes. You have time for this. This is so important. And that book led me to daily prayer, to meditations, to traveling like far beyond what I ever thought that I was brave enough to do. That led me to India where I became a yoga teacher. It's led me to meet Gabrielle Bernstein on several occasions. I listen to her podcast regularly. I share her message, and I swear like I've been on this earth for 24 years, but I didn't start living until two years ago when I found my book on the shelf. Now, like I think about my job and how I can get backed up in people and how I keep traveling, how I can care for my family, and how I can care for people that I love. But been number one priority above starting a family or starting a career, is to continue with this meditation practice and to give this piece back to the, and just make that my foundation, this place of peace and meditation. \n"}, {"job_id": "P1QNhv7pD2LRbd0Y", "filename": "capilouto51a_212944_378044.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Process of growing up has always been of interest because some people are sickly.

I went to the orthopedic surgeon and he said, we're not ready to operate on you yet, but we'll do a, we'll do a, an arthroscopic approach, and then, but you'll be, you'll know when it comes time to have surgery, real surgery. So in 1996, when we went to Italy and we were going through the, the, uh, ruins up from Mount Vesuvius, they, uh, my knees were in such terrible pain that I told my friend from San Francisco, if you had a pocket knife, it was really sharp.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:18    I'd lay down here and let work on these knees at the present time.

She said, well, we'll do one of them and then we'll do the other one later. And I said, no, let's do 'em both at the same time because I'm a coward. And if you take that first one, I'll probably never come back and take it and, and have the second one done. So on February the 19th of 1997, I had bilateral knee surgery and, uh, both knees replaced. And on the February the 20th of 1997, the nurse came in and said, get out of that bed. You got to get up and walk. And I said, you gotta be crazy. So they rolled me outta bed and got me up on my feet and then dropped me and I fell into a, a chair that was near the bed. So it really didn't hurt me a whole lot. But the next morning they got me up, I had to walk across the room, and the third morning they got me up. I had to walk all the way to rehab.

So on his way, walking to school, it starts to rain and he realizes, oh, this was not a good decision. And, uh, starts to rain even harder on his way back home.

So it crawled up the limb and crawled up to way far out. And so, um, she went inside to and told her dad to come and say, Hey, can you help me get the cat down? So the dad decides that he's going to, uh, rescue the cat scruffy with the, by getting the ladder and climbing up there. So as he gets the ladder, puts it against the tree, um, the dog Sparky, uh, came over and actually knocked the ladder down. So not only was the dad, uh, not only was the cat scruffy and the tree, but the dad was to. So meanwhile, someone had to call the, uh, fire, uh, department to come and help because the dad was too far up. It's too high to jump.

So I never did miss any schooling in my class. And when I was able to go back to school, I picked up right where I left off, if you will, or right where they were at that time. But basically, uh, we did nothing. It healed itself. And I went to the doctor. Uh, we lived, uh, about three or four blocks from the doctor. And at that time I was using this crutches to walk around on. But prior to going to the doctor, I, uh, was playing in the, uh, doing something in one room. And I got up and I walked over to the other side of the room to, uh, pick up something.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:52    That was the first time I'd walked without crutches for ever, for 6, 7, 8 weeks. And it was, uh, very miraculous that I could do that. So anyway, we went to the doctor that afternoon and when we got to his office, we, uh, walked in the door and my aunt said, show him what you can do. So I put the, cut, the crutches on the ground, and I walked over to his desk and he said, that's absolutely astounding. He said, I did everything I could do to help you, but he said we had a little bit of help from somewhere other than what I could do. And, uh, from that moment on to today, I have not had any problem, except occasionally since it was a tender area, I was not able to wear high boots or high shoes because it would irritate it to the point where it would heal.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    But, uh, we finally got over that and I went through the service. I wore a combat boost and had any problem at all, and I've never had any problems since that time. Uh, never had any limping or anything else. It was for shortened by about, uh, maybe a half an inch, but my body adjusted to it and my right leg bowed enough so that I never had a limp.

It's about a seven hour drive, got back down here and was still not feeling well. Um, and then I started to realize what I was having was a severe form of my I B S, which I have very seldom, but occasionally, um, which causes the pain, causes me to pass out.

She runs out of the ballroom, down the palace stairs toward her coach, uh, the prince chasing after her all the while on the bottom most stairs. She loses one of her shoes.

It rained as we were going to sleep, but we could still hear the crickets and, uh, the, the popping of the fire just outside the tent and some. And so that's, that's how I went to sleep. It was beautiful. Sometime during the night I woke up, we woke up because it was a coyote howling close by. So we got up and we opened up the tent. The rain had passed, the sky was clear, the, there's a million stars. And we sat and listened to the coyote. And, um, I was actually, it was, it was so dark out there besides the stars, there was nobody else around us. And I was able to get out of my sleeping bag and wander around in just my underwear and sneakers, <laugh>. And it just felt so good 'cause nobody could see me. Nobody cared. And, uh, seems like I stayed up half the night looking at the stars, listening to the coyotes, and, um, got up in the morning and, and grandma cooked pancakes and sausage over a propane grill and we loaded up the firewood and went on home.

Um, I discovered this when I was talking on the telephone, um, working at the office, had telephone up like this on this ear so I can write like this, take notes. It was a fairly long phone call. I get a stiff neck, so I switched the telephone around to the other side and the volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to this side and it was much quieter, so I figured there's something wrong with the ear. My left ear is not hearing the way it should. Anyway, went to an e n T specialist and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma, which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull. Uh, we did some research, uh, found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery, uh, went out, had the surgery performed for the surgery itself.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:02    Uh, first thing I do is shave this side of your head. Um, I had, I got a haircut before I went out, so it would be short, so I wouldn't look like I had a real long hair on this side. Uh, I remember the prep, I remember the shaving for the, uh, uh, for the surgery. Uh, then you're under, you're totally out of it. I didn't wake up and have consciousness until what I think was the second day following the surgery. Uh, they keep you out because they don't want you moving around. Uh, the surgery involves cutting a hole in the head so they can get into where the nerves are, uh, get the tumor taken off of it afterwards. It was a recovery. Uh, it took, um, oh, a week or 10 days before we recovered enough to be able to, uh, come back home.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    I had a nice scar up this side of the head, kinda shaped like a light bulb. Um, and they put a stereo tape on it, uh, to kind of hide it, keep it sterile. The nice part about heading back was, uh, we'd go to the airport and I'd sit in the chair, uh, and I'd, I'd sit so that that side of my head was toward the ticket counter. And my wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say, my husband's had some brain surgery and he's not feeling very good and into any possibility that we could move up to first class. And everybody would take a look at me, slumped over, looking half dead. This big scar running up the side of my head. We got moved up to first class on every flight. Kind of neat.

You need to find a wife.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:50    So they decided to have a ball, and they sent out invitations all over the land for people to come to the ball.

And the night of the ball came and Cinderella put on a, a pretty dress that the mice had somehow arranged for her. And, uh, they told her, no, you can't go. You stay home. So they went off to the ball. Cinderella was rather dejected. And she went out in the garden and there was a fairy godmother. And she said, what's the matter? Cinderella?

So now she's dancing with the prince and she hears the clock start to strike. So she realizes she has to leave. Oh, one of the pieces of finery, the fairy godmother provided was a pair of glass slippers.

Now the prince is left with only a glass slipper and a memory of this gorgeous young woman, and he decides to go throughout the land and try to find her. Whoever will fit in the slipper will be his bride. So he goes around, he gets to the house with the, where Cinderella lives. And, um, the wicked stepsisters can't fit in the shoe, although they try.

He also wants to know who the kid belongs to so that he can charge the parents for the replacement of his lamp and his window. Uh, but by the time he gets up to look, the kid has run away, uh, and he's just stuck there with his broken window and broken lamp, uh, and a, and a useless soccer ball. \n"}, {"job_id": "FHzdr5UFqmAUSc6G", "filename": "richardson23_912610_1072082.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So what happens in Little Red Riding Hood is there's a little girl who lives with her mother in the big woods, and their neighbor is an old man who's a woodsman.

My favorite peanut butter can be of any brand, but I like the chunky style because I eat a lot of peanuts, I eat a lot of almonds. I just, I eat them for the nutritional value. Um, so I do eat considerable peanut butter. From a sandwich standpoint, it's a little bit different for me to even think of eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 'cause I usually eat most of my peanut butter on saltine crackers. But in the case that I am really, really hungry and I'm not just eating a snack, then I would, after locating my peanut butter, um, place it out on the counter, I would then go and find some bread. Sometimes I keep my bread in the refrigerator so it doesn't mold so quick.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    And if I had done that, I would usually toast the bread because I don't like it to be cold when I eat it. Otherwise, I may have taken it off the counter for my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread. 'cause they would gimme the extra flavor of the crust. So once I've located my bread, I now have my peanut butter. I would go to my drawer where I keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife or a dinner type knife and begin spreading the peanut butter onto the bread. What I like to do, um, in, in, in here, this is where the jelly messes you up, is that when I make, I usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of the, well on one side of, but on both slices of bread.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:53    In this case, I have to go and alter my plan and have them put the peanut butter only on the one piece of bread, and I would use the jelly on the other. Now, since I don't have a whole lot of jelly in my house, I do keep at least one bottle or jar, whatever you call it in my refrigerator. And it'll usually always be strawberry because I just like strawberry and it's just like a, it's a good default jelly. So after I got that out of the refrigerator, I would do the same with that, spreading it onto one slice of bread and then smashing them together and eating it and enjoying. \n"}, {"job_id": "7VAdAlfzFkz1YkTD", "filename": "NEURAL6-2_952469_1110056.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    My dad learned a lot of German, but I just barely learned some.

And, um, very different part of France than you usually think of because it's much more like the, it's in the low country, so it's much more like Holland or uh, Belgium up there. And, uh, in terms of architecture, in terms of, uh, the people, um, they're much, much less stereotypical French people up there, <laugh>, in other words, let me give you an example.

And, uh, the next day it was put about in the city that the, uh, king needed to find the owner of this shoe because the prince would never be happy without her.

When two people in a convertible drive up beside him,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:50    Take out a roadmap and ask him directions. The man, the farmer who was planting the tree or whatever, he, whoever he is, points out the directions to them. They are looking at him, he's pointing out directions. Next picture is they have left on their way on down the road, he begins digging the hole. He is digging a pretty good sized hole by this time, and there's a big pile of dirt beside him and he's ready to put the tree in the ground when he looks up and the same people are back again in the same car and they're still lost and they're looking at him and he is showing a great deal of surprise when he looks up and looks at them. \n"}, {"job_id": "ycXLAHdIQ2fMz0vZ", "filename": "NEURAL2-2_52070_207661.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Uh, let's see.

So one time, a few years ago, I was working probably harder than what I should have and should have taken a break when I didn't listen to my body. And, uh, just kept working and working and working. And then I developed a bit of a cough and I ignored it and kept going, going, going. And, 'cause of course, why would I take time to go to the doctor? And then, uh, my cough got worse and I developed a fever and the, the like, cough changed. I don't know how to explain it, but it became, uh, really painful. And, um, I don't know, it sounded different. I can't explain how it sounded different, but it did. And, uh, so I started really kind of feeling awful and, and, uh, I think it started off with having the chills.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    And so I filled up our bathtub with really hot water and took a nice long bath. And that still didn't quite warm me up. And then I went and tried to sleep and that didn't work. And then I finally, because I'm kind of a, uh, I don't like to use medicine so much, but then I finally decided, okay, I should probably take some kind of, uh, fever medication. So I tried to get my fever down, still coughing, coughing, coughing, lots of pain in the chest. And then I realized I can't go to school tomorrow because I'm clearly sick. So I have to call in and I don't hardly ever call in sick. But then I had to do it 'cause I thought, well, I could be contagious. So I decided that, um, I would try to listen to my body and go to sleep, to sleep, but it was too late for that <laugh>, so just sleeping isn't gonna work. And so I went to the doctor and the, I went and had them, uh, they did x-rays 'cause they could hear my coughing and then found out that I had pneumonia. So I thought, oh, well done. How so? <laugh>, they had to give me, I don't remember, some kind of medication. And then I, uh, yeah, after the medication I began to feel better. And for a while I actually listened to my body when I started getting the signs that I should slow down and take a break.

And he goes, well, I'm gonna put mine on because I think that's just a safe thing to do. So as her whitewater rafting, the further down they got, the rougher the water, uh, became. And, uh, as, uh, as they continued to go down, uh, the water got so rough that her life vest, uh, uh, her life vest fell out of the boat. And seconds later, the boat tipped over.

I'll see you later. Mom says, Johnny is walking to school. It starts to rain at first a little bit, and then harder and harder.

And, uh, at the time, uh, she could give yes and no answers, uh, but it was very difficult for her to construct a sentence at, at that time. And, um, then I wasn't around her every day.

But there was contention from the get go. The mother of the girls treated it in Cinderella, like a maid. It was somebody that ah, she could use as a servant while her girls had lessons and got dresses made. Life was really good for the girls and for the mother. And who knows where the man was. He wasn't paying attention. And so Cinderella had to have friends with mice and crickets and whatever, all. And uh, then the community decided to have a ball 'cause they had a prince that needed a woman.

And he decides that this is the one he chooses. But Cinderella remembers she has to be home before midnight because she's gonna return to the s skull be made, and the pumpkins gonna lose its wheels and the horses will be end up being mice again.

What the situation was, had to do with my wife, my second wife. She's a lovely, absolutely lovely woman. And we got, we ended up getting divorced. However, after my divorce, I went to a, a thing at, uh, seminar at a place called Landmark Education. And I learned about, uh, it was a weekend seminar, start on Friday, Friday morning, and went through Sunday night. It was about 125. Was there, there was about 15 men and a hundred and some odd women, mostly, maybe not exactly that, but it was that kind of proportion. And I was, I was, uh, I'd felt very, uh, very kind of down after my divorce. And I had prayed and this was kind of a, the Lord leading me to this session. So I listened and I listened a lot, and the conversation dealt with abandonment. And it turns out that in summary, I think most women, I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:16    And, and I learned very significant things about that abandonment and how people feel and learned that you have to forgive an abandonment. Uh, but I also learned that, which was, this was reinforced. I've been, I was told by a priest back in the seventies, uh, that, uh, when your wife speaks to you just listen. And when you, when you remember is one or two things is what's important. Don't solve every problem. Well, this reinforced that. And, uh, it's very, women have a, that's why if you go back that story, I might've said this, women have a a need more men do too. But they don't, they don't verbalize it. But women verbalize it a lot more. They, when things build up after day, they have a need to come home and dump. They do. And they need somebody to listen. They don't need any dialogue on it or not, but they need somebody to listen. So I learned to, to just sit and listen. And what I remembered from it is to then afterwards, after partner's finished what you remember, one or two things, you, you talk about that and then your partner is, is please.

And over the t over time, she just kind of talked a little bit slower and would use, you know, shorter sentences. And, um, of course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic going on. So she pretty much tried to hide it for years, but eventually, you know, it was, uh, they didn't really diagnose it for a while. And then she went to University of Michigan where they have this, uh, neurology or aphasia center, some type of, where they do a lot of research in it. The thing is, she didn't like the doctor and she told him to fuck off and whatever. So, uh, didn't really get, um, the whole research thing on it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:49    But over time, um, she, you know, just got less and less communicative.

They went out to dinner and she passed out and they rushed her to the hospital.

She full sentences and as if, if she, nothing happened, I take the clock back 10 years. She went to bed that night, she woke up and then she was back to where she was before it happened, so no one could figure that one out.

And it was right about the time my father come home who came home from work. And my mother said, well, just stay down there. Your dad will be home in a few minutes. So sure enough, he came by in about five minutes from work. My mother told him I fell off the porch and I can't stand up. So he checked and said, well, you got a broken leg. I said, oh my God. So he picked me up and put me in the car and drove me over to the clinic at that time. And, uh, I remember being on a examining table and he had taken an x-ray picture and he showed me where the brake was and I said, well, you are gonna be able to fix that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    He said, oh yeah, sure, it'll be all right. But I'm wasn't sure if I believed him or not. So he said, well, first we're gonna put a cast on your leg. So he got a bucket and some plaster of pears and water and mixed it all up. I'm sitting there with my eyes as big as sauce was going, what is he's going to turn to me? And sure enough, they stretched the leg out and reached in the bucket of plaster repairs and formed it all around my leg from my knee down to my ankle and said I should come back. And I can't remember several weeks. And, uh, my father carried me out to his car again, put me in the seat, drove home. And of course I couldn't hobble too much. And I said, well, I got a wagon so I'll just live in the wagon.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    So that's what I did. Whenever I wanted to go anywhere or play or do anything, I would always have one leg. I could stick out the side and propel myself. And sure enough, we went back to the burden of the, the clinic and uh, they checked me over and said, okay, time I take the cast off. And he reaches in the drawing and pulls out this electric saw, which was, again, more terrifying than making up a bucket full of plastic of repairs. I figured it was gonna cut my leg and that buzz, and they cut into the plaster of repair and you could hear it grinding away. The next thing I know, he owes up two halves, said, here's your cast, you have it as a souvenir. So I said, wow, that's great. That's cool.

I see a backpack on his back and mom hands him an umbrella to let him know that it's getting ready to rain. We'll be raining somewhere during the day. I assume he attended class and was walking home. Middle of the story is in the way home. He gets drenched, uh, it starts raining and he is soaking wet.

And I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:58    I would say the beginning of the story is the little girl was out riding her bicycle when she happened to notice that her cat had climbed the tree and had gotten stuck. Middle of the story, I would say. Dad came up and decided he was gonna try to help out the kitty cat, and he as well got stuck.

Two years after the man was fired, the captain, he came back to that area by himself, his wife and his children, and he made a personal apology to everybody, which made the US government even more angry. So I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends. The Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends, but what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble.

I talked to the doctor, um, but the father didn't know. They kept that information from the father. They didn't wanna tell him. I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family, not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying. The mother didn't know if she was dying.

Sometimes extra processing time helps. Sometimes we can do a pantomime with, uh, is it this touch? If it's an object, maybe we can pull the object like a cell phone or whatever. Um, sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it, because sometimes spelling is a little better than actually finding the word in her mind, but visualizing it. And then because we lived with each other and we're together so much, I can kind of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs. Like today with, I knew she needed some kind of check, 'cause I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring, and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card.

We started these girls weekends and it became an annual thing. And typically we went to Philadelphia. We we'd drive or fly into Philadelphia and we met there, or sometimes Baltimore.

Anyway, it turned out to be a great consignment shop and unbelievable clothes. I mean like, just unbelievable clothes.

The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became, so we would go for like a facial or something. Um, and then on Sunday we would always go out for our breakfast again. And then whoever had the car would drive the other one to the airport. And that was it. It was always our, it was a great girls' weekend.

So way back in the day, right after college graduation, I worked in mental health and I worked, um, I worked in a mental health unit at a small hospital in Saratoga Springs, Saratoga Hospital. Anyway, it was a, a 16 bed, um, short-term crisis unit, so two weeks or more. And they either pull their act together or they got shipped off to capital district, psychiatric center. So that was a huge motivation, uh, for them to be earnest in their, in their endeavors. Um, so it was a mental health population. So depending on the diagnosis and where they were that day depended on how communicative, communicative they could be or chose to be. Um, we, we had all sorts, all sorts. And depending on their age, and depending on their diagnosis, and depending what was um, happening, there was a certain percentage of population that were chronically mentally ill.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    So we did have repeat, repeat people. Um, not all old a lot, you know, late eighties. So a lot of the psych hospitals were starting to close down, um, if they had been compliant with their meds. So we did a lot of listening, a lot of urging, um, sometimes just quietly sitting with them. And sometimes that was the best thing not to talk at all. Just, you know, try to quiet the chatter if they were hallucinating. Um, medication. Um, we did, I think, I think in my time there, I did have two people that were actually catatonic. That was very fascinating to watch that 'cause, um, so we had individual therapy, we had group therapy, uh, and then basically every interaction on the unit was at therapy per se. Um, just sitting around the coffee table, the coffee table, the kitchen table, while they were, they could smoke at the kitchen table was like kitchen table. It was a nightmare. It was not a, I've never been a smoker. It was horrible. Anyway, um, so you, I would, we would try to just watch for that individual's cues and just follow them the end. \n"}, {"job_id": "WL8xQX4UPxpcSbIl", "filename": "richardson58_41540_190731.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    The boy was outside playing with his soccer ball.

So he got up very enraged and went to go yell at the little boy.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:32    Okay, great. So I'm gonna have you do the exact same thing. So again, you can see these pictures go together and tell a story. So I'd like for you to tell me a story with a beginning and middle and an end. Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:52    Um, before the boy left for school, his mom wanted to give him an umbrella just in case it rained. But the boy said that he didn't need an umbrella because it wasn't going to rain and that he would be fine. Then he went outside and it was raining and he had to walk to school. He didn't listen to his mother, so he got very wet and he ended up coming back home soaking wet, um, to get his umbrella. And then he, when he got his umbrella, he walked to school very happily and dry.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:27    Okay, great.

Okay.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:45    Um, one day the girl and her friend were outside playing, so, and the boy decided to climb the tree to get the cat out of the tree, and then he got stuck and he was too scared to come down. So the girl ended up calling the firefighters and they rushed over with their ladders to come and get the boy as well as the cat out of the tree. Um, the girls yelling for him that he would be okay, and the dog was also there trying to just barking for the boy to come down. \n"}, {"job_id": "a7P4fsZHo7UhZIPU", "filename": "NEURAL62-1_733152_882263.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And the gentleman gets up and looks out the window holding the soccer ball.

So we have an independent child here and mom is sending him out to somewhere, possibly to school 'cause he has a backpack on and he doesn't want to take the back, the umbrella and she knows it's going to rain, but he refuses. So he waves by and off he goes. And of course it starts raining and it rains and it rains. And he get, he gets wetter and pouring and he goes home to mom who is not happy to see him so wet and he goes back out, I'll dry, but with an umbrella this time. <laugh> mother knows best is the premise of this story.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:16    So here is a photo which you recognize. I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and tell me the story with a beginning, middle, and, and end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:29    Okay. Well, apparently there was a cat and this cat ran up the tree and like cats are known to do, the cat wasn't coming down and it looks like the dog actually possibly chased the dog. The cat up the tree. In the meantime, we have a little girl with her tricycle and she has called her daddy to come help get the cat out of the tree. Daddy took a ladder to the tree and somehow, I'm gonna guess also again, the dog knocked the ladder down. So dad is up the tree, he hasn't got the cat. There's a bird singing, but I don't think the bird has anything to do with this story. Somehow someone called the fire department. So they are on their way with a second ladder and you can see the firetruck parked off in the distance to help retrieve the dad and retrieve the cat. That will be the. \n"}, {"job_id": "gF3uElUcnyHtsYLF", "filename": "NEURAL6-1_806028_954558.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Hey. Oh goodness. Ah, okay. We have a little girl. There was, okay, one, there was a little girl whose name was Annie. Annie had a cat whose name was uh, uh, spot. And one day Annie was playing outside the spot and also with her dog, uh, Rover. And he and Rover chased the cat around the yard and the cat ran up into the tree, got to a far branch of the tree, and sat down. Well, Annie was really worried about that. She was afraid that that spot the cat was not gonna be able to get down. So she called her dad and asked him to come, please, please help get the cat out of the tree. So her dad used a ladder to climb up onto the first main branch of the tree, and the cat was on one of the, the smaller branches, branching right off of that one.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:11    But he couldn't get any farther and the ladder, he ended up by accident, pushing the ladder down. Thank goodness the ladder didn't hit Annie. But meanwhile, Annie's still very, very upset. So somebody, perhaps her mom called the fire department. And so the fire department, the firefighters have brought their truck along with a, what looks like about the same size ladder and uh, they're going to help either the dad or the cat out of the tree. Although perhaps both, my guess is the cat can get out of the tree anytime she wants to. Um, but so my guess is once they help the dad out of the tree, then they will go in the house and get something nice to drink and the cat will come down on her own and the dog, especially if they get the dog back in the house with them so that he can stop barking at everybody. So I think that's what's going to happen. The dad got down from the tree, they went in the house. The cat casually climbed back down outta the tree and disappeared behind the house.

Um, although it was, it was stroke related, but it was not aphasia, it was, um, dementia. Uh, and so the communi, the difficulty she had communicating was, um, remembering what she had just said and remembering what she wanted to say. And, uh, so I was not living with her. Um, I saw her once a month, uh, she was living with her sister, and, uh, so I didn't have the brunt of the difficulty, uh, my aunt did. Um, and so what, what I ended up doing when I came to visit was primarily trying to support my aunt and her supporting of my mom. But what I discovered one time I had to stay with my mom while my aunt was in the hospital. And I was finding it very frustrating and difficult. And, um, so what I discovered is that if I, if I was really frustrated and having a hard time kind of doing what I needed to do, if I would ask her about her childhood, I could get all kinds of fabulous stories.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    And she remembered lots and was able to tell me stuff that I hadn't heard before, which was wonderful. And, um, later on, after my mom died, my aunt ended up with just age, just eight, very old. She, by this time she was 90, uh, two or three, and was very hard to communicate with because she basically didn't follow what you were saying and couldn't really understand necessarily. And so what we did then, I say we, because it was me and my cousins, her children, um, basically just tried to tell her that, you know, listen to her. When she wanted to say something, she, she would tell jokes, which just used to just amaze me that she would tell these cra she always loved goofy d jokes. And so she would continue to tell those. And so we had to, we enjoyed that and we made sure she knew that. And we just tried to reassure her about who she was and where she was and who we were.

I had, was driving down the street, uh, with my kids in my car and my husband and we were stopped at a traffic light and I happened to look up into the rear view mirror and saw a van coming at us and everybody else was stopped and the van was still coming. So I got scared 'cause I knew we were gonna get hit by that van.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:56    So I put my foot on the brake to try to keep the car from sliding forward.

Um, it looks to me like in this picture, uh, it looks like that there was some bad weather, a lot of rain, maybe some flooding.

Um, she looked longly out of a window to the castle and thought how cool it'd be to one day go there, which those sisters thought were absolutely absurd that she would ever go to the castle. And one day they found out that there was going to be a ball at the castle. And so the stepsisters had their dresses made, uh, but Cinderella couldn't go 'cause she, she was a maid.

I'm thinking when my son was little and he couldn't really communicate. Is that okay? It's in the past. Okay. Alright. Um, so he was the second child. The first child spoke kind of, she really, she was a big pointer and one worder princess until like her second birthday. So second child, I really didn't have high expectations for early speech. And, but by his, he just, he spoke so much more. He spoke incessantly and it was such garbled speech. Like he spoke, she never spoke. He spoke all the time. She, when she finally spoke, it was crystal clear articulation and pronunciation, and he just never stopped talking. And nobody knew. I knew what he was saying. His sister knew who was for what he was saying, but nobody else could understand. So his second checkup, I brought it to the pediatricians while he's a boy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    Um, uh, let's give him a little bit more time. So I would just, I would, you know, in between that time I would just stare. I had to stare at his lips and his eyebrows, you know, the expression. It just like he was, he was so demonstrative in this constant chatter. Um, and, um, myself and my daughter, his sister were the only two who could understand, and my husband would come home from work and he would smile and nod and he would like give the shifty eye and I'd be like, try explaining everything that he was saying so that Bruce would then interact with him. And then, um, his second birthday was in February. That checkup was February. He went back for May, and the pediatrician was like, he is definitely just, I have no idea what he's saying. So, uh, meanwhile the whole time he had fluid in his ears and he had constant ear infections. But this was our first year with this pediatrician. We had moved from Michigan to Massachusetts. So anyway, we get referred to a, um, an E N T into a speech pathologist, speech language pathologist, and we go and we see the ent. Yes, he has chronic fluid in his ears. So I said, okay.

When he was, when he had the therapy at Community Outpatient services, one of the therapists there made him a communication book in which he could point to a picture and show me what he wanted. And that should have worked, but it didn't. He just didn't really wanna use it. So now <laugh>, we have lived together for about two and a half years without hardly any vocal communication from Ted, other than what I told you. But I have sort of figured out what Ted wants most of the time. And I can usually ask him, do you want eyedrops? Do you want a face wash? Do you want, do you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you cold? Do you want a jacket? And he can tell me yes or no.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    Recently we have tried something else called, um, well, it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles. And I put them into letter boxes for him to see if that might work, if he could make some words to show me what he wanted. And we have had a very limited success with that, but I would not say it's the magic bullet. Ted can make a simple word if I ask him to, such as cheese, what kind of sandwich do you want? Cheese or bacon? Or, um, what do you want to drink? And he can write, he will sometimes write juice with the letter tiles. Only on two occasions though, has he been able to take the letter tiles and tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out. So I don't know if we can make that work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it 10,000 times. But mostly it's just Ted can indicate that he wants something and then I ask him, do you need the urinal? Or, or, uh, do you wanna take a nap? Or are you hungry? Is it, are you telling me I should make supper and he can tell me? Yeah or no.

We haven't done anything to the house in the last 25 years, and when I first bought the house, it had been owned originally by this elderly woman who, um, had been living there for, I think her entire life. And being elderly. She wasn't able to do any of the housework or maintained the house. So, uh, it was pretty run down when I bought it. And she must have been a real cat lover because, uh, there were stray cats everywhere around the outside the house, inside the house, the, the carpet, just root of cat urine. The walls were crumbling, the plaster was cracked, there was water damage everywhere, I guess. She'd let the windows open and the rain had come in and the place was an absolute, absolute wreck.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    So anyways, we did a little bit of renovations, but we haven't done much since then, and that was like 25 years ago. So anyways, we hired somebody to, you know, put together some plans and stuff like that, and, um, and hired a contractor. And at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the architect are arguing and fighting, being really difficult, extremely difficult to get along with. Um, so they're arguing about everything because it, it's the, the guy who designed the space, you know, says that's the way it has to be. The contractor says, is arguing that it can't work that way, that you need to, if you're gonna tear this wall down, you need to put some support beams up and all this kind of stuff, which means bulkhead, et cetera, et cetera. So I've been dealing a lot with that on a daily basis, at least for the last month anyways, um, so many issues, so many details. Um, you know, and I can't really afford a designer, but I know I should because I'm not very good at it, <laugh>.

In fact, I remember one time I, I, uh, I fainted. I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house, and that was, I was really afraid of, of the fact that I was in a hard tile room.

And then, then, uh, my mom and dad were in assisted living out in Fountain Hills. Then we lost dad. So we put mom into an, uh, a nursing home, uh, up in Flagstaff where my sister lives. And she was up there for four years. And at first she could talk, she went through all the different stations, sta uh, uh, stations of, you know, aggression and meanness.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:01    And she would call me or dad would actually, 'cause she couldn't really dial, but dad would call and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes. And she was much thinner than I was or taking money. Dad would call and hiding in the garage. And this mother, who's making maybe 110 pounds at the most, you know, he was kind of frightened of her because she got really mean. But then she got back into a very calm, uh, state and, uh, slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever. But I've, I learned, and, and Dad and I went to a Alzheimer's support group, which really, really helped us, especially dad. And, um, because my mom and dad, everything, I mean, she had been the one to do all the shopping, send out the cards. And I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards. But, um, finally there was a point where, uh, when Dad died that she needed full care. So, and the last six months she, she couldn't talk or do anything, so, and she broke her hip, had a fall. And the saddest thing was that up until the last year, she was very physically, very healthy. So she died at age 87. \n"}, {"job_id": "rFcjRVNcDBxedRem", "filename": "wright80a_60_141990.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Would take two pieces of white bread with a crust <laugh>, and I get out the peanut butter jar and take a knife and spread peanut butter on one side, get the jelly on the refrigerator.

And then I remember that when we had a, uh, an above ground pool in the backyard, I couldn't even go swimming because of my broken arm, and I was pretty upset.

And it was very limited because we were told to get into study groups and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what they wanted. Like they asked questions for which the answer seemed obvious. Why would anybody say the obvious? So people said the obvious and they were rewarded <laugh>. So those were the people sought after to be in the study groups, not me. So I did almost everything alone for the entire year.

At the end of the year in the subway station, I met someone who I'm still friends with, who I just adore. Um, but we had been divided into two groups of 50 or 75 people, and she was in the other group, so I never saw her. And in second year things improved a bit because then I think I made a second friend and that was good. Like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one or two in the year ahead. So that was a bit better as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the students who all thought they were special. We had one class in second year with a teacher who was really a decent person, and he said, please, when you write your exams, don't think that your mark is a reflection of your quality as a human being.

Little did we know, uh, we really had gotten ourselves in, in a lot of trouble doing that. Uh, there were times where we were actually hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs, you know, uh, uh, just to, just to get from one point to another.

And hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side, but then we would still have to hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car. Uh, to make a long story short, uh, you know, we were all scuff scuffed up. We were tired, scratched up, clo closed, torn, uh, but, uh, we could finally see where we were kind of getting to the top. As we were approaching the top, we saw more people, uh, up there and, uh, older people, younger people, and we couldn't believe it that, you know, these people, all these people had made it to the top, and we had such a difficult time.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:39    So when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people, we said, we asked them, how'd you get up here?

And so Mr. Frank grabs his ladder and he goes over and sets it up against the tree and he's climbing up the tree and then the dog spot comes by and knocks over his ladder. And so now both snuggles and Mr. Frank are stuck up in the tree. And so somebody calls the fire department and they come out there right to the rescue, they bring a ladder and there's two of 'em. So they get Mr. Frank and snuggles down, no problem. \n"}, {"job_id": "DyopozUWrfUkwyK7", "filename": "capilouto36a_295430_426758.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    Well, I, that's easy.

And so that's one of the reasons I continue to contribute as a volunteer. Anyway, that's a happy thought. 'cause it's, um, you know, I just zoomed with my three best friends last night 'cause one of them just retired. Uh, and, uh, you know, we met our first day of college and we've been dear friends for almost 40 years now.

Everything's back to normal and, uh, they get married and live happily ever after.  \nSpeaker 1    00:00:33    So for the last story telling thing, um, I want you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And I want you to pretend like I've never made one before. So like, tell me all of the steps. <laugh>, how to make a peanut butter and jelly  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:45    Sandwich. <laugh>. Uh, okay, well since you don't know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I'll tell you. So, uh, first you get two pieces of bread, doesn't matter what kind of bread, any bread. And then you get peanut butter <laugh> and you get jelly. And, uh, I guess there's lots of ways to do it, but the simplest way is just get us, get a knife, you know, get some peanut butter on there and then spread it over one piece and then take the knife and then dip it in jelly, spread it over the other piece. It's gonna be harder with the peanut butter because peanut butter's real sticky. And if your bread's really soft, it's gonna tear. Should be really careful. And the thing about the jelly is that it's really clumpy, so it might take a while to like smooth out everywhere. And so, uh, then you just put the two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and jelly stick to each other and then you eat it. And that's how you make peanut butter and jelly. \n"}, {"job_id": "oeZywH4LJQcYR7wC", "filename": "capilouto55a_1038140_1160300.wav", "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    And I used a lot of poisonous stuff setting up my <laugh> uh, specimens.

Um, you take two slices of bread and doesn't really matter what kind of bread, and as long as it's not moldy and you have a jar of peanut butter and you open it, you take a butter knife and you scoop out about as much as will fit on the butter knife. And you start on one edge of the bread and swipe across the bread and make sure that you cover all of that side of the bread with peanut butter. And you puts peanut butter away and maybe rubs off your knife. And then you get your jelly and you open it up and jelly is squiggly. So you gotta kind of balance it, put it on the bread, and then spread it out so that all the middle of the bread is covered.

And you think to yourself, yes. And you take that knife and you stab it so that you feel less bad about scooping some out. So you scoop some out and you spread it on one of the breads, which hopefully at this point is cool enough that you can do that. Bread should be a little crunchy, but not toasted per se. And so you spread that on there. You don't want too much, um, say a centimeter of peanut butter, like maybe that's a a little too thick, but that's the idea. You want like a decent amount of peanut butter, and then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you don't wanna wash it off and the sink can get on another knife. It sounds like a lot of effort, let's be frank.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:45    And then you put the lid back on the peanut butter, put it back in the cabinet, you pull the jelly toward yourself, you unscrew that, you set the lid down, it's new.

Some get into a nice, you know, a little liquidy consistency, but it's still, you know, jelly. And then you angle it over your second slice of bread, and then you take the knife to scrape some out. You can try to just scoop some out on top of the knife, but it'll fall off. It's just scrapes some out of the loose stuff and then spread that thinly on top, not too thinly, little less than you did for the peanut butter, but not much. And then you take these pieces and you take the peanut butter piece and you put it on top of the jelly piece because you don't want the jelly to fall off if you put it on top of the peanut butter piece.

And when I first arrived in the area that I had chosen, I had a great deal of trouble getting anybody to want to talk to me.

And so then the prince saw her and he wants to know who wore the glass slipper 'cause he kinda liked her. So he is searching to see who can wear the glass slipper, who it fits. And the pretty girls tried it on. It didn't fit either one of them, so they decided they would try it on Cinderella and the slipper fit.

Well, there's a little bird up there, but I don't, he's not barking in the bird, we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree. Well, what he's, what is he doing from that? So we look a little further. We see a kitty cat on another branch, which is clearly too small to hold a grown man. And beneath the kitty cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying, come here, jump. Come kitty, come down. And next to the little girl is her tricycle in a very short ladder. Now this, this tells us that there is a little girl who's kitty cat climbed. A tree can get down. Dad went up and the kitty cat got stuck up there. Dog is helping, he's barking. And someone called the fireman and they're coming to rescue. First the father and then the kitty cat.

That was, it was a Stevens Johnson syndrome, which is not unlike a burn, although there was no, no burning to my skin. It was all a result of the allergic reaction. And that stopped the chemo. I had one round of chemo, and then the allergic reaction took place to the medication, not the chemo medication, but to a medication that's designed to protect, uh, kidney function. So I was in the hospital for three weeks. That resolved, I started chemo again, and, uh, I finished chemo this past May, and I've been in remission since.

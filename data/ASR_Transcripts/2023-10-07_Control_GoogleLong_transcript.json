And that was a once in a lifetime kind of experience.I was with initially five other people to them dropped out part way through the trip. The they didn't consider it safe. But it was it was a fascinating trip. To see that that part of the world. And we paddled in one case, past two days of forest fires on One Bank of the river. And the smoke. We had to put claws over her mouth too. To be able to breathe properly. The smoke was quite heavy. The paddling itself was not particularly onerous because the current is very strong and McKenzie river. But we did paddle a lot of minor 10 hours a day to to keep going. We average about 72 kilometers a day.Battling. Covered almost 1400 kilometers on the whole trip and surprisingly an awful though, we were on a river. Drinking water was one of our biggest problems because MacKenzie River is a very silty River. You can't see a half inch into the water, so we had to find sidestreams that were clear in order to get fresh water to be able."

And I never spoke in class because I could never understand what they wanted. Like they asked questions for which the answer seemed obvious, why would anybodySay the obvious. So people said the obvious and they were rewarded. So those are the people sought after to be in the study groups, not me. So, I did almost everything alone for the entire year. and when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes, she said she had to get permission from her group. Because they couldn't share notes outside the group. So I said, thanks, but no, thanks don't bother.And somewhere along the line, I found a group that really didn't give a shit and anybody who wanted to could be part of it that was me. So I was part of that group for some classes, at the end of the year, in the subway station. I met someone who I'm still friends with who I just adore. But we had been divided into two groups. Of 50 or 75 people. And she was in the other groups. So I never saw. And in second year things improved a bit because then I think I made a second friend.and, That was good. Like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one or two in the year ahead, so that was a bit better. as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school, And the students who all thought they were special. We had one class in second year with the teacher who was really a decent person. and he said, Please, when you write your exams. Don't think that your mark is a reflection of your qualities.

The decision was going to be, is it? It was lymphoma. But is it going to be Hodgkin's lymphoma? Or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Can you tell me what the problems were and what you did about them? Yes, my first experience was, back in the late 1990s, I worked with a physical and occupational therapist with the hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges and thePurpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they. Had been, but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything than another child could do and write a horse. So that was my first experience was was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that that could not be understood and and the kids were great and they were you know, they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry and you'd have to you'd have to be able to tell or I learned how to tell which we're really tears of pain and which were tears of just like I don't want to do this. And now of course fast forward to hear. This has been an amazing experience working with both children and and adults who have had Strokes, who are unable to communicate and what they're doing, you know, to make themselves better. And I've taken cues from the people with whom I'm working, what not to do and what to do and and really work on that making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps."

So we knew we could see as many games in the South and then the Midwest. And and even though we had traveled extensively internally, and while that was very, very exciting. This was the most fun that we have ever had and when we were done, we really felt like we had accomplished something and we were also very sad that it was finished but every time they build a new ballpark we'll be going. So and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is that we actually created our Christmas cards, our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself and the first one.It said from baseball season to the holiday season, may you always be safe at home.

So it's kind of a sad story but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in this sense of the cycle of birth and death and whatnot. So it turned out that he passed away that night and I never did see him again and I was very emotionally distraught byBecause he and I had a very close relationship and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life and then looking back on it as an adult. Now, realizing that this man really was an angel of mine, I didn't realize it then but it came to believe. And I don't know if you want to know about my personal beliefs, but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that, there is still a connection, there came to learn about that and it just served as a real learning in my life in many different ways."

I was a happy Carefree child playing with my friend, down the street and it was back in the day. When there was a lot of freedom, you went out the door and came in for lunch. And then you went out the door and really weren't very many parameters and there were lots of fun adventures to be had and came home to find out that he had had a and then used the word stroke but that's what he had that he had to go to the hospital from work and so my friend and I remember God cookies together and put them on the counter saying when Grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning, I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like. I have that feeling of what it felt likeTo find out that he wasn't coming home and just as a child an innocent child kind of coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And I had my four sisters were there, and my cousin who is in the nursing home? She was around, because she she kind of live with us for a while. And it was just, she, actually, I remember she slapped me, because I was crying. So hard. Everyone went to all the adults went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that. And I was hysterical crying. I was so so sad and she didn't know what to do. So she actually slapped me to get me and it worked. She wasn't being mean, but I was beyond being consoled at that point, and I felt very alone in my grief. For some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man is my grandfather. But anyway, that, that was a theme that came through my life and lots of different ways in the future. And I remember a time when I was in sixth grade and we were having a sleepover in my friends. Backyard happened to be with a girl who lost her, dad in the north riots. A girl who lost her Young Brother to leukemia, the other girl had lost her grandmother and I had lost my grandfather andIt was like, they can make a movie about the bond, we were all in the tent and we were just talking and I can see us all sitting there. And we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there, it was by the safest place to ever let it go. And we all just, just let it out and I remember feeling so empowered by that, and finally, feeling like I could share this and it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life. You know, as I grew up and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didn't know about angels then but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe and he can sort of Watch Over Me If You Will."

Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.I would go to the bread cabinet and open it up and pull out a loaf of bread. I would untwist the ties and take two pieces of bread and set them on the plate and they need to match and go this way when they're open. So that they crusts all line up, it has to be that way. We would go into the cabinet and get the peanut butter and then the jelly is in the refrigerator. Both jars would need to be opened. Now first, I would take the peanut butter and smear it onto one half of the bread, then I would take the peanut butter knife and clean it off. On the other side of the bread just to make sure that it's not going to cross contaminate the peanuts into the jam which is really going to do anyway but not that bad. Then we get the jam and spirit on that side of the bread.What's this complete? Both pieces are lined up together. One paper towel is wrapped to cross the bottom so that the crumbs don't come out and you can eat it with your hands and not have to worry about a plate and wipe your hands on the paper towel."

Once upon a time, there was a woman who had two daughters, she married a man who had a daughter of his own and when they came to live together, the two daughters of the woman were very, very unkind and and we're not happy about having this other girl come live with them. So in fact, they made her do all the work and all of the chores. This other girl, the new, the daughter of the husband. Her name was Cinderella and they made her do lots and lots of work. She was very, very kind, however, to the animals because they were really the only friend she had.Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace and what was happening in the palace at the time was that the prince was was time for the prince to be married. And so his father was saying that that they he needed to decide who he was going to marry. So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village. So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family. Her stepmother, received the invitation under stepmother, told her daughters about it, who got very excited but they didn't really say anything to Cinderella. And the daughter started preparing their dresses and getting things ready for the ball, but they were not going to give address to Cinderella. So she went into her Treasure Chest. She opened up a book and had some old Fabric in it and she looked at that and and decided to make herself address for the ball. But then when the time came for the Sisters to all, go to the ball, they said, oh you need to fix my dress and you need to fix my dress and they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs before long. She had nothing to wear to the ball and they were not gonna have her go with them. So off, the sisters went Cinderella, was so sad, she went out into the garden.and there, she Saw happened to see a pumpkin and and the mice and pretty soon. A fairy godmother appeared and the Fairy Godmother. Said to Cinderella some magical words and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage. She turned the mice into Horseman or something or horses and she turned Cinderella ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown. Cinderella went to the ball but the Fairy Godmother said you must leave by midnight because then the coach will become a pumpkin and your dress will turn back to rags.Cinderella walked into the ball and the prince and she began to dance. But at midnight, the Clock Struck and she knew she had to leave. So she ran out of the castle. She ran down the steps and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers. She ran and ran into the fields until indeed her dress returned to rags. And the coach turned back into a pumpkin. And one of the mice, had a key for some. Oh, I know, because I guess they locked her up or something. I can't remember why what was going on in that picture, but they either mice unlocked the key. Oh yeah, cuz the prince was coming to to see whose foot fit that glass slipper because you was though woman, he wanted to marry and when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe. They tried the shoe on the two sisters and it didn't fit, but Cinderella was locked up, but the mice found the key unlocked, Cinderella's room, so she came running down.

So thank you cellulitis. I had cellulitis about, I don't know 10, 12 years ago,And yeah, you want me to talk about it? Okay. So yeah, I had cellulitis and I got very, I thought I had a like a stomach flu, my kids were sick and then I was feeling sick and I just figured, we were all just sick. And I, my husband had to go out of town. He left on a Sunday night and it wasn't feeling great that morning I got up and I felt awful. The kids were fine by that point, but by Monday morning, I felt awful. Like to the point where I could, I remember feeding the kids breakfast, they had their cereal on the table. They were only three and five at the time, and I, then just put my head on the kitchen table, I couldn't even lift it up.And I called my sister because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting vehemently and it just and I had been for a long time. I knew something was not right. And I, because I actually had been sick for several days now that I think about it. I'm because I hadn't showered and I called the doctor, they said, yeah, you need to be seen. And, and I called my sister and she thought I wouldn't wanted her to just stay with the kids and I said, no, you have to take me. My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive because I can't not throw up.And so, she was like, whatever. Okay, so she came over and I remember wanting to clean myself because I hadn't showered for days, I thought I can't go to the doctor. And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I went to, I was cleaning under my arm and there was this huge lump. I thought to myself, I'm like, God, I developed breast cancer like overnight And but it was like noticeably in large. So I I thought it was strange though, because I was sick of my stomach. It didn't seem connected.So my sister took me and she right away understood. When she saw me, how sick I was and and that I kept, you know, having to throw up in the car on the way. The doctor was just so bad. I walked in I we had just moved Indianapolis, I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first, that's who saw me. She looked at me and within 10 seconds, she said I have never met you in my life. You are very very sick. I can tell that was like okay, yeah, let me lay down lay down on the table because I couldn't even sit up. So, um, they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually cellulitis and that it had, you know, turned into this and her horrific infection. So they were quite concerned um, about my condition. I need to get blood work right away, Etc. And apparently, they told my sister, we she is severely severely ill and like, if she probably should be hospitalized. She's very, very dehydrated. But we don'tWant to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're going to see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated, and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever, too. And my husband came home because he was so worried. I guess my sister I was delirious at this point."

In the next 24 hours, she has to be hospitalized, and that is dangerous. She is that great risk of sepsis And so I just remember it as I felt bad, whatever. I was, I knew I was gonna be fine. My husband's memory of it is that I was dying. And I mean they did say, you know, you can't die from sepsis. It's true. I just felt sick, but whatever. And I do remember that, it was horrible them.

So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner and I could tell, I was starting to feel and and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother having been my mother always could look across the room. And when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say it's time for you to go, isn't it? So, we kind of reached that point but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room. People try that kind of thing, which of course, never works, because the animal lives there.And I and I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there, but we did and or maybe I said, I'll be okay, I'll be okay. I took medicine and and whatnot, but by the middle of the night I was beyond, okay?

Now, I can now dogs are different, but yeah, but in terms of recovery that's You know, it was quick. So the next part of this question is a little bit different.

        "transcript": "Right? I don't know if you've heard this or not. If I mentioned this, one of the things that I have been doing for the last 10, 12 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis, at Riley Children's Hospital and it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons.So I very much have learned from that. A not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult, that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them and that has that is a lesson because it's easy to make that assumption as I'm sure you know. Um, so I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact from their facial expressions from their emotions that may be jerky. That may be just excitement. That that is a response to the story. And while I can, I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understandingAnd capacity with this story, I can sense their emotional and respond to whatever it is that they do. Understand in the story and it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection even when there is no speech coming back on their end. So thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from you or a kid or more recently.I'm going to meet myself now and you can begin and This time, I will tell you about the birth of my first child. Um, so it was 22 years ago, on March 14th, I was due on March 9th. I had the Good Fortune of having a fairly benign, you know, easy pregnancy.Uh, and nothing had happened. Nothing had happened. We were on today, five after the due date, and I, that day was singing in a, a very unusual thing singing with a choir that I was part of a small chamber group, I should say that I was part of at a wedding, so the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So, um, I went to the wedding and we sang and I did kind of notice that, you know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but you know, whatever. And and the wedding was beautiful, it was very unusual to have a chamber Group sing at the wedding.Then I came home and I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened, periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial and I called my sister who lived I was in Sacramento. At the time she was in Southern California, and she is five years older than me, and three kids older than me. So, she already has three children and so we're talking on the phone."

So I was describing a little bit of what I was experiencing that day and she said, Sally, you're having a baby today and I said, no, I'm not, because I didn't even, you know, there wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and whatnot. So I kept saying no, no, no, no. She said, yeah, you're having a baby today. So, and that was really like late afternoon when that happened and byAbout. Six o'clock. I think it was It's I started feeling more stuff happening and still, I didn't think we needed. There was any big deal. I, you know, it wasn't like enough and I think we must have arrived at the hospital by by 7:30 ish it was like okay yeah this is real it's it's time and so on the way to the hospital and my husbandThink this is my first child again kind of confused anyway. He's of course you know like no because you're gonna maybe dinner right now and and so of course I was having contractions in the car at one point he was speeding like he was feeding and and he barely would stop for the lights and we all continue to laugh because my words were I I yelled at him to slow down and said it's not about you. It's about me. And I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous, but he and I just always laugh at that still to this day. It's not about you. It's about me, which was a stupid thing to say, but you know, who's rational at that point? So we got to the hospital and she was born at about 11:00.Thirty five boy. What kind of mom am I? I didn't remember somewhere after 11:30, because I remember when she was born, then that, um, I was thinking about what date it was. It was the 14th and that somebody had hoped that. If I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday. And I had, you know, missed that window. Um, but anyway, so it, you know, of course, that's incredible. When you hold your first child in your arms for the first time, but I was exceedingly grateful. That it was a relatively quick delivery. And and you know that's not to say it didn't hurt Ashley, that's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a, you know, a great experience all in all. And and then we had our first baby.Wild. Now, she's 22. Is that enough is that also tell a story? Take a second to look at them and then when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with the beginning.

Team, the best he could do, was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around, he kicked and kicked and kicked. And eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house. his neighbor was an adult man namedUh, Ferdinand."

By the time he got home, he was drenched and his mother could not help herself. She said I told you so that itThen it felt bad about that and knew that his mother was right?

I saw her once a month, she was living with her sister.and so I didn't have the brunt of the difficulty, my aunt did And so, what what I ended up doing when I came to visit, was primarily trying to support my aunt in her supporting of my mom. But what I discovered one time I had to stay with my mom while my aunt was in the hospital. And I was finding it very frustrating and difficult. And so, what I discovered is that, if I, if I was really frustrated in having a hard time kind of doing what I needed to do, if I would ask her about her childhood, I could get all kinds of fabulous stories and she remembered lots and was able to tell me stuff that I hadn't heard before which was wonderful. AndUm, later on, after my mom died. My aunt ended up with just age just a very old. She by this time she was 90 To three and was very hard to communicate with. Because she basically Didn't follow what you were saying and couldn't really understand necessarily. And so what we did then I say we because it was me in my cousins, her children basically, just tried to tell her that, you know, listen to her when she wanted to say something. She, she would tell jokes which just used to just amaze me that she would tell this crazy. She always loved goofy dumb jokes. And so she would continue to tell those. And so we had we enjoyed that, we made sure she moved. And we just tried to reassure her about who she was and where she was and who we were.and sometimes she had moments of clarity and sometimes she didn't and we just had to keep up with her whatever she was doing."

And that usually comes down and in the process of doing that unfortunately I was standing up getting trying to find like purse and pass out right then so that I went down flat Fang on the hardwood floor.And apparently, I was unconscious. My husband, of course, heard the fall, and I was unconscious enough to scare him. So he called the EMTs and I by the time when they I woke up when they were already there, And no, I'm sorry, I didn't actually I woke up before they came and I was saying I'm fine. I'm fine. Don't you know? so they convinced me, they I they convinced me that I should probably go to the ER in case it was something more than what I thought it was and so I didand, So, I got to the ER, and the doctor there, of course did whatever they do and far in terms of diagnosing what had happened and among other things, I had a m r, I think, or CAT scan, can't remember, and it. Ended up showing that I had. Pancreatitis. Which was totally undiagnosed. And totally. After I found out later talking to a doctor about, it had nothing to do whatsoever with my symptoms. So, I just accidentally got diagnosed with pancreatitis. Spent a couple of days in the hospital meantime.My head had a huge lump on it, and my hip from falling and nobody, any doctor said one word to me about that I was so completely kind of out of it that I didn't recognize what was going on. Why did I have these lumps? And finally. So anyway, a couple days later they told me I could go home from the pancreatitis and I said so what the heck is the deal and it turned out, of course I probably did have a concussion But it wasn't apparently serious. And so, that's good. So anyway, I went home under the instructions, not to drink alcohol, ever again, in my whole life. And I enjoyed wine, a great deal and so, but I absolutely at that point stopped drinkingEntirely and haven't had any real reason to try to. I have complete and utter total fear of regain at this point, actually, so I don't. So anyway, regardless I haven't had any other symptoms of pancreatitis and my head and my hip are fine.

Like for trucks and they were tracks, was that was his specialty. So anyway at that point, the company offered him, the opportunity to go to Europe and and work and do his job there because they needed somebody to be doing that.And so, after a lot of discussion, we decided that we would do that. So We? He went over first in 1998, we sold our house. The school. I was teaching that was partly residential, so I got a job working in the dorm and living there. Our son went off to college. And our daughter was already. Already finishing up Advanced degree. SoI lived in Vermont for another year. And then I went over after our daughter, got married, that June after, and I finished my teaching job, I went over to join my husband in Switzerland, which were and it was, we lived in a little village. Outside of Zurich and in Switzerland, you don't have any urban sprawl or anything. So you have these little Villages that are just kind of compact and self-contained not that they have that much there. I mean there's really just usually a small store, a post office and houses and so we live there.For a year. And during that time it turned out that they really needed John to move to France to. And of course I was a French teacher and I had lived in France as a student. And so moving to France was, of course, like a dream come true for me. And so we ended up moving to France and lived. There, we lived in the city called Leo, which is about an hour north of Paris. and,I was just in heaven, just can't even tell you how much I loved being there and my husband did too, although his French was not. As good as mine, although it got a whole lot better as we were. There and just Zurich, they speak German, but it's Swiss German and most people speaking English. So anyway, I ended up teaching English. And we had a wonderful time everybody that we knew practically came to visit us. And we did a lot of traveling around Europe at the time and so it was just a fabulous experience and then we came back in 2003, right? As the Iraq, the invasion of the rock happened. And I ended up getting a job in Ohio where I ended up teaching it, the high school that we Stark went to, so there we are."

Although, perhaps both my guess is the cat can get out of the tree anytime she wants to.Um, but so my guess is once they help the dad out of the tree, then they will go in the house and get something nice to drink and the cat will come down on her own. And the dog, especially if they get the dog back in the house with them, so that he can stop. Us. So I think that's what's going to happen. The dad got down from the tree. They went in the house.

She had just said and without any awareness that she was repeating herself, and of course, at first that's You don't really know how to deal with that. And I had it, I'm not sure, honestly, I don't, I'm not sure that I did this, but I think that I would say, yeah, Mom, we decided on that, you know, a little while ago. And so we're gonna do this. So I would tell her what we had decided when she brought up first time.um, so that graduate got worse. It was diagnosed by her doctor's vascular. Dementia. So she was having little tiny Strokes that were knocking out. Connections in her brain. and the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright real colored, and She would. Tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something. She would read in the paper that somebody had died.and then, Talk about it and then later do the same thing. And then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before and I didn't, and so, I didn't know what she would. She would make up reasons. Logical logical reasons. Why she hadn't known something. She also got really good at asking questions, instead of asking, you know, making making asking other people to talk instead of having them ask her questions because she knew she didn't wasn't able to answer questions.I, so, I think. I'm not sure, but I think. That this was some reading that I had done. Which said that with a person with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely, no point in trying to help them to remember or or make them or For Heaven's Sake, make them feel bad about. Um, because of course, for there's a period of time in there.When you? when you realize, when my mother was realizing that she was, Losing. Memory. And and it was horrible for her. She felt Awful and and of course, after a while it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore and that's really better. At least it didn't hurt her so much. And I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what,Experience means. experiencing things mean, when you means when you can't remember them, like we would go to plays and musicals and concerts And this was when she was living with my aunt, and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies. Really? But but musical things concerts and musicals musical theater. mom would have no memory whatsoever of that, the next day, but She loved it while it was happening. Just was delighted. She was always Musical and this kind of stuff, just please her no end. And so I had it was really interesting to think about what She? What it means, what that means, is it valuable. How valuable is it when you don't remember it? And I decided ultimately it was really valuable."

And like cats are known to do. The cat wasn't coming down and it looks like the dog actually. Possibly chased the dog, the cat up the tree. in the meantime, we have a little girl with her tricycle and she has called her daddy to come help. Get the cat out of the tree. Daddy took a ladder to the tree and somehow I'm going to guess. Also again the dog.Not the ladder down. So Dad is up the tree. He hasn't got the cat. There's a bird singing, but I don't think the bird has anything to do with this story. Somehow someone called the fire department, so they are on their way with a second ladder.

And I a car ran into me from the side at a fairly good rate of speed. and, I don't remember. Much of the accident except that I heard the story so many times, my children, when the car came to stop.I don't remember anything about the other driver or where they were, but I can almost visualize the moment that maybe I came to, and my oldest son was able, he was in the front seat, he was able to open the door and run for help. And I remember telling him this, I do. Remember, I remember saying tell Richard I need to call call Richard and tell him I needed. And so fortunately there was a home very close and he ran and used the phone and of course they called 911.So, my husband was on the opposite side of the city and hit the car and came flying all the way across. And the younger child was in the backseat and he, I don't remember looking at him, but he didn't seem to be hurt boys, and they weren't The Voice. Turned out to be, okay. They had to cut me out of the car with the jaws of life. And they were putting me in an ambulance just as my husband to be arrived and he followed the ambulance and save them while they checked out the kids and took them to my mother's house.And who was on the third side of the city. and, She kept the boys, he came back to the hospital by the time he came back. I think I was having test run. I don't remember any of this part, except for having a reaction to some ivp guy. And I have a flash of being in an elevator, And I remember that I felt hot and sweaty. It's weird that I remember the reaction, but that's all and I don't I just remember hot and sweaty was a bad sensation.I was in the hospital for two weeks. I had pelvic fractures, ribs concussion, and I would call my mother. I could remember her phone number. And from the very beginning, I would call her constantly and I'd say hi. Where am I? Hi. Where am I bless her heart? She just she answered the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we do it again. This went on a lot. But as the days went by the concussion, have a little bit better. And I remember they took meTo a whirlpool bath. And using, you know, a whole harness system to lower me into this tub and I'm not sure it helped that it felt good. so I was released in the hospital after two weeks and and my husband came by every evening and brought outside food because the hospital food. So, I went home and I was on Precious with no weight bearing, all summer. So this was in about this time in June about maybe June 23rd.and, we had a wheelchair, we used to when he get home from work, you know, we throw the wheelchair in the car and get out of the house because I was getting older crazy. And by the end of the summer, we got married. And that's kind of the end of that story. Can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating?

My husband's Aphasia is moderate to severe and after having chemo six years ago, it's even worse. It actually had improved. And the chemo really made a difference, excuse me. So I have. And you think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget,and, One of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left back, he's still gone to the hardware store. and, I'm I think I would have not done before and make a list of what he was going for because he might forget. And then he has to explain to the people there. Although he has had so much therapy that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get a cross. What he wants in, it's very rare, there's a failure there, he draws a lot of little tiny picturesBut I've learned that to be sure. I it's hard to remember to verify all the time and it doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend and maybe he thinks he comprehends. So how do you discern between those two things? That's quite difficult him? Yes. You think he understands perfectly? Or does he not understand? And does not really want to say, he doesn't understand. so things like that, make it Very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him, you can take it to the bank. He totally understands if he sees it written.I know not to ask him numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. I did find out in the last week that he can repeat. Thanks to you. And that is something he has never been able to repeat, not even one word. And now he seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he could tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask me to the word. Um, it's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability. That'sI've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man because women are more other women are more caring, more empathetic less frightened, And I think men are not in general. So, there is this learning curve for men. They have this discomfort and so, it's just easier to avoid. And I always feel bad like, for him. Because he hasn't left out a lot. And I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter to explain to people what's wrong, and please don't interrupt andplease turn the TV off or please turn the radio off or you don't have to shout, although I don't find that so much, but some people do People are not comfortable with disabilities, they don't understand. And even if they understand them at first, they feel awkward because they don't know if it sensitive and it's gonna upset you to talk about it. Please tell me what we've been doing this for 25 years. Oh, we're not going to get upset about it, it's just what it is. so if it's it is very difficult to hurt him to be in a group of people and not be able to contribute."

But I remember so clearly the delivery room. This delivery room is on the campus of IUPUI. And it is now a health center for students. And I don't mean I'm not really sure exactly. I don't think their rooms that they stand or that sort of thing. I think clinics I think but this is an old post-war building.And I believe it's two or three stories high and it was a women's hospital. At the time I had my first two children, and, The most amazing thing about this room. There were windows and a door. With on it was on the second floor and there was a it's still, there you go to the Riley garage. You can see it. There's a stairway down, a wooden stairway. No, West down to the ground level.

We don't know, it's his home or his neighbor's home but it goes to the window, breaks the glass.And not only does it break the glass. It knocks over a lamp. Probably breaks it too and there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and plant falling over. and he, Gets up and goes to the window. Holding. The ball.

I think he's on medicine that doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often. I haven't been there since the virus, but I kind of just hug them and I just look in his eyes and just tell him hi Steve. And it's so good to see you and he'll say good to see you too. He doesn't remember my name. He remember Sonny's name but he knows that he knows me.But as far as what I would do to help them talk. Okay? There's not a whole lot. I can do because his conversation skills or are gone, they're just gone but keeping it really simple for him. Maybe ask a question. That's maybe real easy for him to answer. That doesn't involve memory. Like how are you feeling today or? You know, I like your pants Stephen, something like that.

There's also a growth around the size of a nickel. And so anyway it had to be open it had to be open shoulder surgery and I went with supposedly the best doctor andAnyway. That night, it was considered a day surgery that night the nurse came in and she went to my arm. Can you feel this? Yes, can feel this? Yes. Can feel this? I said, yes, can you feel this? No no, no, no, no. So she's like, oh, don't worry about that. She goes. Sometimes it takes 24 hours for the block to wear off. and I had a horrible horrible, horrible night of pain like I was like out of my mind and pain and I kept bringing the buzzer all night and then like around, oh, I don't know. Three, four in the morning, the nurse came in. I think she had me up to here with my pain and she's like, alright, I'm giving you morphine and the next thing I know she came in and she was like in my thigh and that was the morphine and it was around 6 o'clock. The surgeon came in and he was doing his rounds to the morning and he saidI heard you had a really bad night and you know open surgery is very difficult for it. And You know, it wasn't it. I guess from the time of the MRI, went from a partial tear to complete tear and the growth that was a nickel was the size of a golf ball. And he also discovered that the bicep was torn while he was in there and he grabbed bone from my collarbone. And so, basically, he was like all from collarable all the way down to the bicep and you know, lots of nerves in there, whatever. So he's like,It was rough. So I understand that. So I said, okay and then he said, so for the pain he said I can give you another block Now, I had one for the surgery. So now it's like say six inch in the morning, he, and I'm supposed to be day surgery. He said, I can give you another block, and it will take you off. He said, but it has to tell you that sometimes with the second block, people lose feeling in their fingers. Like and it doesn't ever resolve itself. Now I'm, you know, still still have the morphine in my system.But yet, I remember this and I was like, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do because I was remembering what the nurse said that I you know 24 hours and it was kind of like it did concern me the night before so I was like, I don't know, I don't know and he said well Bridget he said you. I I got to see everybody else on the floor so you think about it and by the time I come back here you had to have a decision. so, I was like, So I was like but I may never get he's well it's 50/50 doesn't happen. Somebody but you know your chances increase so boom off he's gone andI was like fighting to stay awake because I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school at high school and I wanted to tell him Bruce do not let him give me the second block which eventually Bruce appeared. I told him that I told him everything I just told you I'm like I don't want the block mean while I was out of my mind and pain. There was a wonderful male nurse He kept me there till like four o'clock that afternoon. So I surpassed the day surgery timeline and finally they discharged me. RPS, Madison, that was July of 2010.

So, Ryan set in my lap and we faced her like this. And she proceeded to give him the test.which he proceeded to pass, because Before she moved the drums, she he was so smart.

And she worked wonders, and we ate drank and slept letters and sounds that sheep in the Jeep book. Alphabet cereal, alphabet pasta. It was like crazy town, so we did that with private pay with her.And then a three years old, the town would pick him up so I thought is a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that SLP just in case with funding and Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use. I can't would be not ready for me to take your money anymore. He was initially when she met him consultation. He was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder. Which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she, you know, when she dismissed him, you're good, he's all good to go. I was real par.Choose. The only thing is 50% of the children with this. Diagnosis. The way they're taught traditionally taught how to read in public schools. They're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that point, you know, have so I don't know what go to private school, get another read. I didn't know what we're gonna do Madison, but I was like. So anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP. Who had just graduated Madison, she was lovely.So sweet. He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on every time we went in there. She was so sweet. She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave, he would look at me and smile. Oh my gosh, it was terrible.

So, anyway, in this land where they live, there's a kingdom, what theyKing and a prince. And they make the castle makes a declaration, they're going to have a ball. And all the young women in the land are invited to come meet the eligible, Prince, and the stepsisters are very excited and Cinderella is excited because she's not married as well. And then she quickly finds out from her stepsisters and stepmother, that there is absolutely no way that she is going. She's just not worthy of going plus. I think the stuff sisters really could always tell. She was much more beautiful than they were and they don't want the competition at the ball. So the night of the ball comes and they lock her in somewhere, I think the old stories, they locked her in somewhere and off they went andThese crying or sitting there so sad and what a horrible life and her father, and she had such a great life and she's been terrible since he died and her fairy godmother appears. And she shares all that is happening and not happening with Fairy Godmother and the Fairy Godmother Cinderella. You're going to go to the ball. and, She gets the help of the mice and she does all sorts of baby. Boom, Magic on little Cinderella and Her hair is done her makeup. Her jewelry. A beautiful gown, and she takes a pumpkin from the outside, and she makes that a beautiful, beautiful Chariot, and the little mice are. But you know,Italy baboomed, and they're turned into Horseman. And She's just about to leave and she says a wonderful time. You look beautiful. However, all this magic and the spell will expire at midnight you must get home by midnight. Cinderella is certainly off. They all go. It's beautiful Chariot to the ball. She goes, she's by far the most beautiful woman in the room and the prince finally asks her to dance and then they continue dancing throughout the evening.And they're enjoying each of those conversation and all of a sudden she sees and then starts hearing the clock, which is about to strike midnight. And she says, I have to go. He says, no no, she says, yes. Yes. And as she's rushing out of the ball and down the palace steps, she loses a slipper. She gets in just barely gets into that Chariot and out of the sight of the palace. Puffed back into a pumpkin, she walks the rest way home, the mice, and she gets home in time before the stepsisters who then arrive home.And they share with their mom and Cinderella. What a wonderful time they had but they do kind of sort of make reference that the prince did spend most of his time dancing with one beautiful woman. so, next day or two, it comes out that that woman, that monopolized, the prince, lost her glass slipper when she was leaving, and He?"

So that was a huge motivation for them toThe earnest in their in their Endeavors so it was a mental health population. So depending on the diagnosis and where they were that day depended on how communicative communicative they could be or chose to be We had. All sorts all sorts and depending on their age. And depending on their diagnosis, and depending what was happening, there was a certain percentage of population that were chronically, mentally ill. So we did have repeat,Repeat people not all old a lot, you know. Late 80s. So a lot of Psych hospitals are starting to close down. If they had been compliant with their meds. So we did a lot of listening, a lot of urging. Sometimes just quietly sitting with them and sometimes that was the best thing not to talk at all. Just you know, try to quiet the chatter if they were hallucinating Um medication.Um, we did, I think, I think in my time there I did have two people that were actually catatonic. That was Very fascinating to watch that. Because so we had individual therapy we had group therapy and then basically every interaction on the unit. Was a therapy. per se just sitting around the coffee table, the coffee table, kitchen table, while they were They could smoke in. The kitchen was not.

So I knew it was gonna be open. Shoulder surgery, went in and the slight tear in the rotator cuff at that point, from the time of the MRI, to the surgery, went from slight tear to a full tear. He also saw the first time that my bicep was fully torn and that the nickel-sized growth. Apparently now is the size of golf ball so he grabbedCollar bone area. And the bottom line is he was, you know, from this area. He was all the way down bicep area. and, That it was supposed to be a day surgery. Later that evening, the nurse came in monitored to me monitored to me. and I had horrible pain all night and then Eventually around, I don't know. Three, four in the morning. I really don't know what time she came in and she gave my thigh with the thing of morphine and knocked me out. Finally, it was she had done that at midnight.And I forgot a really important Point earlier in the evening. The evening evening, nurse said, came in and ripped, my arm here. Can you feel this? Can you feel this? Yes. Yes. And when she got to like made forearm, can you feel this all the way down in my hand? I said, no. And she was, oh, no worries. Sometimes the block takes up to 24 hours to wear off, but I was kind of like, Kind of sort of freaked out about it but anyway, but I didn't know any better. So into the bad night morphine for six months around three, four in the morning and then the surgeon came in for his rounds. Early in the morning, like around 6ish heard you had horrible night. I said yes. And I was supposed to be day surgery, so you're gonna have to go home soon. It's only gonna get worse. He said, so I'd be happy to give you another block, but I have to tell you,There's a 50/50 chance that they give you another block, you could lose feeling in your fingers forever. And I remember just being like, where's why, you know I've never heard this before. Anyway, so I didn't want it, but I was in I was already starting to be in a lot of pain and I only had the morphine would only been, I don't know no more than four hours old. So I was panicked. I said, let me think about it. He said, you think about it but I'm gonna go around. Do the rest of the Floor, come back to. You have to have your answer by the time I come back. So I said, alright as soon as he left I was like a can chance it and I was afraid to fall asleep. Bruce was coming. He was dropped. The kids are high school at that point.One of them was so he was there by 7:45 in the morning. Told them the same story just told you. And I said, I don't want to risk having Sex. So he didn't and there was a wonderful male nurse on that day for the morning shift. And he like medicated me as much as he could with the orders, the standing orders to make it a day surgery and get me through. Ended up being released around for that afternoon. And anyway,It there was, there was a lot of EEG and all sorts of tests and second and third, opinions, Boston. In New York, they all said surgeon error.

I went to work every day, due date was January.January. 18th and first baby, the baby was not born. We did not find out the sex and even back then you could I want to be totally surprised. I love surprises. So on January 18th I had still not had the baby and had a scheduled check up with the OB doctor. Assumed it would be my last. Visit. Anyway, went in after work.

So, anyway, the whole time, I'm carrying this baby. Which, by the way first baby? This baby barely moved and I had comparatively to the second. I had nothing I thought it was fine becausewhat did I know nothing and Every time I would push my stomach, I would say, oh, she cuz my mother had three girls, and my other sister had three girls. In my other sister had a girl. So, She's really firm but this is wonderful. So last visit last checkup he does an internal and he's like oh why don't we go across the hall? I want to do a scan or I don't know what it what they call it at the time. and he says, yep, he goes just what I thought and I was likeWhat, you know, because I'm cloud. Like it was just such an exciting time because the baby is it not in position. So you're gonna have a C-section And I was like a C-section that was one of my two secret. Secret fears of having a baby. Not. You can. Flip this baby. You can do this. You can do that. He's like pregnancy. We really don't know why the baby drop. I can't see. I guess that was another thing on.You couldn't see the cord, or I said a little bit. We don't really know how long the chord is. He gave me every reason this baby was not going to be flipped. So, you know, there's lots of things out there Andrea. This was a, this was a Thursday, January 18 but she looked to see if I'm correct in my memory and Went home that night. There was no internet but like folk law. Like, Upside down leaning on up ironing board, off. Flashlight between your legs. All this like, kooky cookie stuff. But anyway,Monday, it was a Thursday Monday. I was scheduled for my c section, so on Friday, my blood work that was the only day I missed at work. I worked full day on Thursday missed Friday and she was scheduled to the baby was scheduled to be born on Monday. And Sunday night. I went to bed and my water broke. And I was so excited because then I felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready. It's not like C-section, like just gripping his baby out. So I was like all excited and we were Michigan by yourself. So I didn't wake up my husband. I decided to go get my bag and I got everything ready by the door before I woke him up. and I showered I shake my legs and now the contractions are getting worse and I could not find the list of people he had to"

You know, my brothers, tried like different.Hearing aids for her to see if that helps, you know, buying the Headless speakers and some stuff like that. It really doesn't help. So now I'm just, really practicing trying to look at her when I talk, which is become a challenge. If you have a face mask on, but looking at her and remembering that she can't hear me because I don't always think about it because I've known my, you know, my mom's never been hard of hearing and now she has a hard time hearing. They just have to remember to speak up.And often I don't remember that until I shoot until I see you're looking at me going, what are you saying? so, We're working on that one stuff. I would like you to tell me thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Something that happened to you could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to.

So we were at my father-in-law's and my daughter had also flown in from Florida. She just got there the night before we stayed up really late. And then we woke up in the morning and we were going to go do stuff and we got a call that said her water broke. and, That the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car.Drove two and a half hours to Columbus. And made it there before the baby was born. Just waiting in the waiting room with her mother. And her stepfather. And then getting the text that the baby was born and that they'd be out a little bit. So it was a very exciting day. We got to go through the baby. We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off. So, once again, I'd like to show you these pictures, take a little time and look at each one, and then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Little boy, or the teenage boy.

The neutron accelerator?and, I wasn't being careful because I was looking through the camera and it took one, too many steps to the left from about four feet off the ground and was above an area that was gravel and the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact, embedded in concrete. So I say took one step to many in tumbled off the left side, just instinctively put out my elbow to stop myself andThe elbow. Good and I was lying there for bed a bit when did and electricians came over and Checked on me and I said, I'm fine, you know, I'll get up, be up and then it but didn't realize they really couldn't stand up because my leg hurt and the left arm elbow was well enough. Very, very swollen and I couldn't not move. My lower arm at all.So, they asked if they should call an ambulance. I said, oh, that's really not necessary and I'll probably be okay in a bit but The longer I was there the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg which turned out to be a very minor problem but the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I was lying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the 40s that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting Shivers. Andand they did, in fact, call an ambulance who came and, when they came over to, check on how to get me out of there because it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up and It wasn't really obviously couldn't just pick me up and get me out of there. but, First, they wanted to check to see.if I had head injuries so they it's estimate some questions and One of the questions was where I was. so, I told them I was at the cyclotron building, but by that point, it was known as the ASAP Hall, which was the The. Science and accelerator Technology. Hall.but it also changed its name to the mess hall which was the multidisciplinary science and accelerator Technology Hall and No science Hall, and of course, they didn't know any of that. And but the worst The worst question was. That I was hoping they weren't going to ask me who the president was. So I said, please don't ask me that. so, They wrapped some. kind of canvas strapped around me to keep the arms stabilized and then and then with one of them on either side, they could get standing up."

There's that thumb that was when I worked at fermilab in Chicago for a couple of years and I lived in a area called West Chicago. and, Had a motorcycle I bought, when I was living in Bloomington, after I'd graduated. Geology degree. but, Didn't want to leave.well, I didn't leave town until I got the job at fermilab because I kind of for to do something. I was working for the University, physical plan doing sheet, metal and Roofing stuff. And Wasn't getting paid much very was enough to buy a Kawasaki H1. 500cc two stroke three cylinder motorcycle. Which is very fast.But handled really badly and February careful. But the only real wreck I ever got into it is in Chicago now it's going home from fermilab, Back to the outside. Lived in sort of in the country between DuPage County Airport, and the little town of West Chicago and as I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and the bike started. Vibrating really badly.They didn't recognize it because they had back tires. Go low before, but never had a front tire low before. So Or I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder on the front brake and pretty severe break and since the front tire had gotten really low, it just suddenly like down into the street cost me into the ditch. I got up out of the dead and the other two problems, one is that the back then I wasn't veryGood at wearing protective safety gear. So, I was riding motorcycle without a shirt, even a pants and shoes. And so ahead gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder that I get shoulder. But the other problem was, this thumb was just kind of Dangling. Like it wasn't connected anymore because it wasn't this bone here was just broke clear off. so, This was really too many years ago to remember, it's 1979.But I think some of the neighbors are driving into the same Gravel drive. I lived in and Help me roll the motorcycle, kind of up the little Hill, a little bit, and parked the motorcycle. And I, Maybe thinking, right? Home, I don't know. I just remember getting into my car.

We did a lot of snorkeling. The water is just absolutely beautiful.most of the Bahamas, the water is only about less than 20 feet deep. so, as you're sailing to the next place and we didn't always know where we're going to draw anger and hang out for the night sometimes in just, some totally uninhabited area or sometimes near an island, where it could go to Shore and and, Explore the shore and go to a restaurant. And They've been on other trips like this before but this one was this one was really good. It was acatamaran, which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between and Got into some storms at night where just bouncing around. Like crazy all night. The a lot drank, a lot and snorkeled a lot. Got a lot of great underwater pictures, that recruiters and things. The very last night of the tread.And me and the captain, it's the guy who we all met at our Salem Club because when he was living in Bloomington working on a journalism degree, did he moved back to Florida and he arranged us running the boat for the month? and, He'd grown up.

And it was time to learn to sew. so, I was sewing on a jacket with a little tiny 1/8 seam, and as I was, Moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the needle and, you know, it does that, and I yanked it. So, the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer. He said he was gonna pull it out and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital and they had to remove my fingernail and slice my finger open. Take out the needle and then x-ray because they had little splinters ofMetal in there, x-ray that and then sew it back up and I had a huge Band-Aid. And unfortunately, like, two days later, it was the little middle school dance. And I was embarrassed because I had a new dress and I had this great big old bandage. What helped me get over it. I think it was just time. Just time. I have more injuries here.Thank you, one more for the road. No. Um, that was great. Thank you so much for sharing and oh my goodness. I do not sew. That was the end of my selling days and this helmet teacher hasn't been retired long. And I was used. She said, here I am back even had her when she was in Middle School. She had to use me as an example, through all of her years of teaching. So how's that? Um,But I am curious. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad it can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind, okay? and so in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did to what you did about it, if anything, I was special needs teacher for 10 years and still go. So does Becca for that matter. Still go to eagleary once a year with them and there areUsually seven to eight that go and we chaperone and they have classes. But three of them are brothers, of which only one can speak the others. You have to. follow their hand communication, it's not that they sign language but they Try to, because it's more in the grunting. Aspect of. Interesting enough. Usually her, his mom knows what he's referring to.so, I would say, It's more being patient and they eventually get their story out by pointing by doing the same thing over or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you. And I think that is probably my nephew is autistic and non-verbal. And pretty much it's the same thing. He just takes you by the hand and takes you to where he wants to go."

Okay, here we go.well, when I was young, I Speculate. I should know but I speculate. I was about eight. And my friend and I back in those days you could walk the neighborhood. She lived a pretty good ways. But it was still a neighborhood and she was on her bike and I was walking behind her, and then she decided it would get us to her house faster if I rode on the back of the seat with her.So I hopped on the seat and she started peddling, but my foot, my heel got caught in the spoke of the wheel as the wheel was spinning and almost cut my heel off. So, she rode ahead to her house. And I was walking. As she had gone on to her house, I was walking and all the cars that were passing thought I was crying because she had stolen my bike.So I finally said, nobody stopped to help me. But finally got to her house and her parents weren't home. So we called my mom and my grandmother was there too and they came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. And in the waiting room, a man came up to me to show me that his head had a fishing hook in it and that mine was worse than his and I should be proud. But I remember this old man with a fishing hook hanging out of his head, so I got stitched up and I was fine.Like you to look at all these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Looks like there's a little boy who's just hanging out by himself playing soccer when that ball accidentally goes through the middle of that window. While the guy is sitting there watching TV, probably he looks a little shocked. and he takes the soccer ball, and Keeps it. So again here is a series of pictures. I'd like you to look at all of them first, and then tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end. I'm gonna make this up as I go.

Let her out of the room because when they came, they didn't want Cinderella slipping out. So yes, she was able to put on the slipper.And she lived happily ever after. With her little mice. For your first prompt. and, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Um, first I would probably go to the store and buy peanut butter and jelly because I do not keep that here, nor do I usually keep bread. So I would go to the store, buy all of those ingredients, and probably a bag of potato chips, too. Because I do like to put potato chips in my peanut butter and jelly.so then I would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread. I do like my peanut butter first. So I would pull out a knife and I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread. And then I would get my strawberry jam because I'm not on a great jelly. So I would get my strawberry and I would put it on the right side and then I would open my back of chips. I would insert some chips into the middle as well as put some on the side of the plate.

Alright so last time I'm going to tell you douglasy, last time we went through sewing, my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult. So I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother, I had an older brother and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then. And the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get the to the top of a wheelchair.That wheelchair my brain to get to the top of a tool shed. so I followed suit to keep up with him and I shimmy the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed, but I was pretty scraped up from and I decided I didn't like following state with the shimming of a tree so they should be down. I was not going to show me down, so my brother. Little. Butt hard. He put a pile of leaves.Together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and tried to. My mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff. But, no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery about was the fact that you have a cast. So you had to say prop for a little bit, but mine is that it was a walking cast.I was fine. That's what I remember of that. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad any type of difficulty communicating. But what I'd like to know is what The issues were and what you do about those issues or did. I'm going to have to tell the same story, so that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church where I was there. Sunday school teacher for 10 years and still go to Eagle Ari with them for special needs Retreat. It's a group of about five to 600. Special needs most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities which includes like the big square dance.So, you just help them whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they. Have a hard time walking. But most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate and hear over top of it. The three boys that I spoke of last were all Brothers of which only one communicates I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two, don't, it's a series of grunts some sign language over the years. I've, of course, learned the girlfriend and this means one is engaged to Becca.We have her wedding ring upstairs. He brings money in his pocket, that's his Dowry, so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate but through his sign. It's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying, his his sister and his mom usually know. So they are communicators but it's just Their communicators for them, put it that way, they will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer. And by facial expressions, you know,"

Just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about and you can take time to think if you like I was gonna say, because I'm gonna try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injuries stories.What was important as soon as I hang up from you all go, why do you? What is important? Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries or like stopping moments as I have when that hit last year and she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU hell,um, that went on for a period of I don't know four or five days or so, and Oh my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that I'm not sure who was going to bring her. I called her on a Friday. After I got off of work, she had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu too. I guess Jackie was still there at that point in Mark andwhen I called her, she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to. call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the ER that she was dehydrated and she needed to get Intravenous, then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth. That didn't make her feel bad, or well.she did get the bone broth and it did not, and Mark did take her to the ER, They did release her. It wasn't long after that IU, then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying and then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know, that they need you. So it was the decision whether to hop a plane that night and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie, it was Jack because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day and we were in the doctor's office all together. Jackie was our show for the entire time we were in the doctor's office and he admitted her into the hospital for that night.and, The surgery was the following night. I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night which I was glad that I did because she was with it, but not really with it. But staying there with her for a few days afterwards, she was a trooper but none of my children have really been sick. so to be so far away,And not be able to be there immediately. so I'll turn down good but as you know, there's still is"

She had to beat the tapestries, she had to make the meals. She had to do everything forUm, then Along Came the invitation to the ball. She knew that that Palace was nearby. And that she would be, she thought she was going to be invited. So she pulled out her book of how to make a gown, and she made a beautiful gown for herself of which the sisters were not gonna allow her to attend and they tore up her dress. So,The Fairy Godmother decided that she would give Cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball. So I believe it was a pumpkin that turned to the coach. I believe that gustas and Friends became the horses and she took the carriage, oh, very godmother gave her address as well, and did her hair. Probably her nails and toes too. So but she told you only have until midnightSo she attended the ball, the prince was Gaga over her and they danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight. She realized how dangerously close she was and she ran down the stairs. Of the palace and lost one slipper. She got back everything turned back to normal the pumpkin and the mice. And I think stepmom got suspicious about who that was at the ball that the prince had fallen in love with and locked her in a room, but guess Justin friends were able to get her the key she got out.

I didn't go in the emergency because I just wasn't thinking, I was just like this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English. I've been in an accident. I am hurt. I need help. Now.

Go get your blood pressure taken. Then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and and talk really fast and write everything down that he says. And then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day.I came in. Going to pee in the cup. And then went to go to take my blood pressure and I'd have to sit at this machine. And it takes your blood pressure and prints it out and then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did. I went put it in there printed out I handed it to the nurse. And she was just like, mmm, no, no, no, no. You have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay, so I do it again and it prints it out and it's just as high.So, they're like, so irritated with me by this point. Like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse who's the professional, right? Does it and realizes holy crap. This woman's got like, high blood pressure and then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away and they said, we're checking you in right now, andso, because this is very serious and they checked and they had like, I don't know what is it like Sugar or something in my urine and my yeah. So there's all kinds of problems happening with me. Unbeknownst to me And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet. And after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down. but then they said, Well, it's You're we could send you home but but we're not a hundred percent sure that you could control this. So, we think we should induce you because it was I was far enough along.and so it was a Tuesday morning and they said at 5:30 in the morning, we're gonna bring you down to induce you And they oh, this is kind of gross but they made me take a suppository.

I took all of it was a good girl and for a while, I kept listening to my body and not trying to do too many things and when I realized that I was starting to get tired, then it was time for me to just stop and say it will still be there tomorrow.And it's okay. I just need to Pace myself and I can move forward. Even if it's slowly, I'll get this done, it may take time but I can I can eventually make this happen but it's better that I take the time now rather than like killing myself by trying to do too much, right?"

And he was a he was a bit of an older gentleman but he was kind of like a guy that was always Just busy. He was always busy working and really really serious. He's like a farmer kind of guy living in a small town.And one day, he had a stroke and he was left in a chair and this was, I mean, this had to be like the 70s of the 80s. It was a long time ago, right? And he and he ended up in a wheelchair. And unable to communicate and he expressed extreme frustration. With the fact that everyone around him could not understand what he was saying, nor could he be able to express himself the way that he wanted to?And I remember his wife was her name, was Vita, also very sweet woman, and she would run around and try to help him as much as she possibly could. And, and I just kind of as I was probably about nine or ten, but I remember thinking, dude, she's trying so hard and and I probably was in my mind. I probably wasn't very kind to him. because I could empathize with her more than I could with him but I thought you know I think that he needs to realize she's really working hard to make it make this man happy but now if I look at it from his View,He had the full capacity to walk around and and he was a man, you know, he'd go out and build things and mow the lawn and do all of these different activities for his entire life, and that's what defined him. but then all of a sudden he wasn't able to do that and he grew really quite cantankerous and Very, very frustrated in, you know, in the end, I don't remember what ended up happening with them. It's like, but I just have that really strong memory of how much that he was struggling and she was struggling. I know he died eventually but I don't know. What it was that got him in the end, but it was very very challenging for, for him and his wife and and the whole family. Really,"

And I think I remember him trying to write down information. We did a lot of guessing. And and it's kind of, like, with babies right with babies. They can't speak and express themselves. You just have to figure it out. And I think that that's kind of what we had to go back to with him, was to go back and make sure that his basic needs were met and then go from there after that. Well, what could it be? And a lot of times it was this oh, that's what he was asking for, right? But it seemed like it was so something so simple, but we couldn't.Figure it out. So yeah, so it's one thing with a tiny child but then with a grown adults, I have to be able to decipher because prior to that the child they didn't have this ability to understand whereas adult had lived a fully expressive life and to have to go back into try to explain that's really challenging."

And then my cough got worse. And I developedA fever in the. Like cough changed. I don't know how to explain it, but it became really painful and I don't know it sounded different. I can't explain how it sounded different, but it did. And so I started really kind of feeling awful and and I think it started off with having the chills and so I filled up our bathtub with really hot water and took a nice long bath and that still didn't quite warm me up.and then I went and tried to sleep and that didn't work. And then I finally because I'm kind of I don't like to use medicine so much, but then I finally decided, okay. I should probably take some kind of fever medication, so, I tried to get my fever down. Still coughing, coughing coughing. Lots of pain in the chest and then I realized, I can't go to school tomorrow because I'm clearly sick. So, I have to call in and I don't hardly ever call in sick. But then I had to do it because I thought, well, I could be contagious. So, I decided that I would try to listen to my body and go to sleep, but it was too late for that. So just sleeping isn't gonna work. And so I went to the doctor and the I went and had them. They did x-rays because they could hear my coughing and then found out that I had pneumonia. So I thought, oh well done how so they had to give me. I don't remember some kind of medication.And then I yeah, after the medication, I began to feel better. And for a while I actually listened to my body, when I started getting these signs that I should slow down and take a break. How?"

And what a mysterious thing. This was but it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual period.And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor and I was sent to the ER, for x-rays for this one collapse. And it was never complete. It was only about 15 to 20% of my there's always my right lung. and so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse and I spent some time trying to figure out what on Earth could this be And finally, I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm.And at the start of each menstrual period, I think it is bleeding breaking and bleeding into my pleural cavity because I have found 69 examples of where I have. I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation. And the doctors said, well, you might be right. We'll send you to a surgeon. So, I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery, I don't think that's it but we'll do surgery and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had homeonectomy and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm but instead heUm, cemented the top part of my right lung. To the cavity that holds it in place. So that the next time I would have a bleed into this area if that's what it was, in fact. My lung would not fall down. And create a partial collapse. So that's what happened. after that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened,But I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end, the surgeon said, well, I guess that's that is what it was. I guess, you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis but bled into the plural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of what type such that I would no longer have menstrual periods. And it all turned out happily ever after.

It didn't? He just didn't really want to use it. So now we have lived together for about two and a half years without hardly anyCommunity vocal communication from debt other than what I told you. But I have sort of figured out what Ted wants most of the time. And I can usually ask him. Do you want eye drops? Do you want a face? Wash? Do you want? Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you cold? You want a jacket? And he can tell me. Yes, or no. Recently we have tried something else called. Well it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles and I put them into letter boxes for him.To see if that might work. If he could make some words to show me what he wanted and we have had a very limited success with that. But I would not say it's the Magic Bullet. Jen can make a simple word. If I ask him to such as she kind of sandwich, do you want cheese or bacon? Or. What do you want to drink? And he can write, he will sometimes write juice. With the letter tiles.Only on two occasions. Though has he been able to take the letter tiles? And tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out? so, I don't know if we can make that work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it. 10,000 times. but mostly it's just Ted can indicate that he wants something. And then I ask him, do you need the urinal or do you want to take a nap? Or are you hungry? Is it, are you telling me I should make supper? And you can tell me. Yeah. Or no. So, that's pretty much how we communicate."

And a nurse who came to see us in our home. And that occupied just about every morning of the week.

Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you and your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently.It was February 1978. It had been snowing all day. and in fact, that was the year, when we had the blizzard of 1978, And we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon on this day in February, when my husband came home from work,Where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church. He said, Carla come in the house. I want to tell you something, I want to ask you something. So I said, okay, so I followed him in taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He says it down for a minute. So I said, okay, I'm sitting, what do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years? Kenya. I said, where's Kenya? He said it's on the equator where it's hot. No snow.I said, Count Me In. Let's go. And so we did. He had received an invitation to come and work with the national Christian Council of Kenya and a family life. Education program, where he would be responsible for setting up a Counseling Center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in Community Health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it. and so, four months later,We had sold our house. Our car, most of our household possessions With the exception of a few that were stored by a friend. And our family of four, my husband, Ted our two, daughters Michelle age, 9, and Cindy, aged five. and I, got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, Pennsylvania, because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran in background,And he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite Mission program, who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to a 10-day orientation period. In the heart of Mennonite country and Akron, Pennsylvania. Where we spent 10, marvelous days. Getting to know. The Mennonites and also a group of other. People who are about to embark on mennonites-sponsored.Mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee? So that began a three-year period of high adventure, for our family, one of the best times in our lives. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see, From with the beginning, a middle and an end. Well, in the beginning, a little boy is outside playing with his soccer ball.

If it's his house, we'll say it is And he gets up and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out through the whole of the broken window and he sees the boy and we don't have any more pictures here. But I think the little boy says, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. And it will will assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry. Sir, that I broke your window, but I will work for you to try to replace it and so that's what he did.So again, these panels of pictures, tell a story, take a second to look them over, they go left to right, and then bottom and then left to right again. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see with the beginning a middle and an end, The little boy has his backpack on and he's getting ready to go to school. And his mom says, it's raining outside. Or it's going to rain and you better take an umbrella and he says no look, this guy is completely clear. I don't want to take an umbrella but I think you better. The weather weather report says it's going to rainBut he won't do it. And so, she said, all right, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school and sure enough pretty soon it starts raining. and as then he, he keeps on he he starts to continue but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now, and he's really upset and he Runs back home. Drip. Drip. Drip on the kitchen floor and his mother says, I told you and he said, well, you are right.

So this first Picture Tells a Story, take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story. You see with the beginning a middle and an end. Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat. and one day, the dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree.And they're the cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see, from the picture, the dog is still barking. So, of course, the cat isn't going to come down And she probably cried and cried and finally her father came out. And what's the matter kitty cat is up in the tree and the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat and so he did, but the dog is still barking. It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage but he didn't think to do that. So, he is now up in the tree, trying to get, but he can't get as far out as the cat is, if he did, he would surely break the limb, and he would fall. So, as you can see from his expression, he isSomebody maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening and she called the fire department. And so here comes the fire department, they are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away. And rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree but the dog is no longer barking. So the cat jumps down."

So, there were very few options for me except to just have the baby and I didAnd I just remember her coming out and looking like a little Monchichi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And She was so Brown. Her hair was so Brown and she had this brown hair all over and I had light hair and her dad has light hair. So it was just pretty incredible to see this. This little baby with all this brown hair. Anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just don't. It doesn't go away.

And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember My gynecologists like, you know you had a very quick first born, this is going to happen again.and, I sat I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks and all I could think was. When is this gonna happen? When is that terrible? Horrible pain gonna come back. And that's not how it worked at all. Actually, I He was also born on his due date. So now we've determined, it's me. Who has to have things in the right place, but we wrote to the hospital, I checked myself in. It was so calm. It was the exact opposite andHe came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face.

Doesn't matter like they were completely different, they are still completely different, but they are. The best things I have. Like, I look at my life and That's it, it's them.

And when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, I remember feeling a lump under my left, armpit my left side and it was in a really funny location. So I was sort of surprised.That I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram, and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound, and I took my friend Dorothy with me. and the oncologist, who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be Consistent with Stage 2 cancer. So, I called my sister who's a nurse practitioner, and generally has always handled myMedical stuff, but she lives in Chicago. So she wasn't gonna let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington. So, I went to Chicago to Northwestern for what seemed like that entire summer, May June July. It takes many months to compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer and especially the first time they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they Choose the best course of treatment, especially because I was 40.They view that as young and so is pretty radical. So, anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months, and months of Agony. And then ultimately have I have a bilateral lumpectomy so they found it in both sides actually, after all the tests and That was removed. My surgeon at Northwestern was great. Very comforting and confident, which is what I needed and then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So, my surgical oncologist was finished with me. After my surgery, the medical oncologist, then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation, and then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here.So after I had my surgery a week later, they put my port in and the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to the where they administer the, the drugs for chemo and I had treatment every other week for a couple of months. and I,recall sitting in just trying to think about how the drugs were awful and you can taste them. You can smell them. but, In your mind. You imagine how they are. Killing Cells. They're, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that. said that's I guess how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing being killed after my chemo rounds. I did 30 rounds of radiation. And that just made me tired so that was okay. And then that was right. I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6th my radiation ended just after Christmas. So my goal was to move into 2017 with No treatments. And that's what."

We had a room that was like a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it and I justSlept on the floor and I wasn't experiencing any any pain or terrible itching yet but that did come.

And it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store and she probably,Was not going to do that because in order to save money but it worked, I do remember that. And and I remember, She would put me in the bath with that oatmeal kind of mixture and it was very soothing. And then after the bath would put this again, this paste or this Mixture on the different spots. but even though those things helped me, Physically feel better. The thing that I I remember about when I started to feelBetter like really feel better. Is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff stickers and we had sticker books and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers. And I focused on my sticker book instead of the chickenpox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the, you know, the kind of itching and scratching, and it put me in a better mood. So I wasn't a lethargicAnd, you know, I got better. Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating?

That none of them wanted to do.so Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and Wonder about what life was like. Outside of the wall, she lived in and, The castle there was a family obviously who lived there in the prince was looking to find. Love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all everyone in the entire Village come to this ball.so, Cinderella's stepsisters. got all of their, you know, their lovely items together, and their dresses in their hair and all of these things and Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball and Since her stepmother and her stepsisters didn't help her all of the animals did.

Her stepsisters, and her stepmother ruined, her gown, and she was very, very sad. And the stepsisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with, you know, ripped up dress and and nothing to do.

Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time? Communicating? Yes. And so that's great. Yeah, so because now what I'd like for you to do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situ,And I'm going to meet myself. Okay. Um, well, I'm not I'll just say a person or this person or The difficulty in trying to communicate with this person is that this person lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time. Conveying that in words and many times it turns into emotion or feeling and which, you know, can be anger frustration? Any of those sorts of things but that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated. But on the outside we have no idea because those words never came out.and so, What I try to do as ask questions. And see what kind of answers. I can get to put together what the problem is because it's much. Easier in my opinion to deal with. Those sorts of things as they come up rather than waiting until someone is like a powder keg. And just Blows up. However, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate because then their problem is, why are you asking all these questions?um, and then it's sort of like, then you back off and you give the time to to calm down. But then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because say in this in this situation it's a work environment and you I need answers and I need clear communication. So another thing that I have tried to do as I see one individual in our office, who can communicate with this person and so ITake notes on how that person works with the other person and I also use that person occasionally to help me. Understand and get information as well. I won't say that it's successful all the time, but it is a successful enough for me to get by. So asking questions, backing off as needed. Feeling out the situation in finding an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage.Thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand What you already talked about might also fit this, but if you could choose something different to talk about, in this case, that would be great and it can be happy or sad. It can be from any point in your life church from child to now. So do you need a few moments to think about what? You know? Okay, yeah. And I will meet myself and you may please tell me your story. Sure. It's one story but it has two parts The most important things to me are my two kids."

I think the metaphor I used last week is that she'll look through a series of pictures endlessly and make relatively the same comments. So mostly if she starts talking and she talks less than she used to, um, I'll redirect if she gets into something that is agitating to her or kind of super sad, if she keeps repeating it.

So, the Cure ultimately, The Cure was to have a tonsil operation and have my tonsils removed. The process was a very long, in fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose.The cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time, they were trying to figure it out what was wrong. And then I remembered my family changing, the physician. And then this position who saw me for the first time says, we need to, we need to take out his tonsils, right away. And so I was bedroom. I had to stay in bed, but the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to Show that I could do it in contradict the doctor's orders.So that was my most traumatic. bent written experience other than, you know, flu two or three day, flu or stomach virus, that was my major illness and I was late, going to kindergarten oh, I always remember that spent some time trying to catch up with the rules and everything was the way it had been for about a month. And I could not join them until a month later. So I was playing catch up in kindergarten.Our next prompt. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time? Communicating? And this is kind of an open topic, any type of difficulty communicating and fits. But what we'd like is for you to tell us what sort of problems there were with communication and what you did about it. so, for about a year,I was teacher, I was teaching Spanish, very fluent in Spanish and I was teaching Spanish and Salvo Regina University. In Newport Rhode Island. In one of the students in my class would completely refuse to do anything, you would not answer questions, you would not. Respond would not participate. He was excluding himself from the classroom, every class, every class. So eventually I said, okay, we I have a problem here.I tried different things to you know may making him the silent participant in in plays or kids that we would put on in class. Even that men met with very partial cooperation. So I called him to meeting. And then he told me very long story of how his parents had spent so much money. Tutoring him, or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through High School in math. In English, everything is a version towards education thatManifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish. The reason why he was not participating. he could have been just making it up, but I think he was. At least he made the effort of coming to the meeting. To explain to me why he was not participate. I took that as a positive move on."

If you write a short essay for me, And that is how I started writing and I felt so much love writing that ever since I have become a writer and I haven't been published, but I have a lot of writings that started with that incident that Mr. Jenkins induced.After I broke his window.

And the second one that I had a very good excuse to get a hold of the umbrella. So, I went back to my Charlotte, I said, look, I could get ill and who knows? I could get, I could catch Coronavirus.Because of getting you. So the only way to prevent this is by your lending, your umbrella And so faced with this. Incredible threat.

I don't need an umbrella, any left and sure. Enough, as he got halfway to school, it started raining. And then it started raining harder. So, he turned around, and he went back home and told his mom you were right, it started raining, and she was not very happy with him.

So pretty common surgery. But I guess the scariest thing was they gave me the epidural and afterwards being paralyzed from the waist down was quite and interesting feeling I should say and my son had to go into a special care Nursery. So he wasn't in my room with me, and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the Special Care Nursery so that I could nurse him. So that was a rather scary kind of feeling when and I guess, because I've worked with people with stroke and other neurological disorders. It kind of gave me at least a little bit of an inkling of what they go through and how they feel.Not being able to have some motor control. So luckily that only lasted for a few hours and and then it wore off. But that was actually the first time I ever had to go into the hospital when I was in my 30s giving birth to my son and Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating before? Yes. Um tell me what the problems were and a little bit about what you did about it. Okay, well, I am the associate director of the Aphasia Lab at the University of South Carolina. So I work with people with Aphasia every day and have been a speech pathologist for over 30 years. So I guess you could say I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last 30 years of my working life.And what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people who are cognitively intact, but yet are not able to express themselves. So, I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So have just always been really interested in ways to improve. And of course, for the last four years is when I've been at the Aphasia lab. So we focused on Aphasia and being able to number one, help them increase, or improve verbal communication.But also I teach the adult language disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication supported conversation with family members, and just trying to improve in general, people's ability to communicate, no matter what their verbal communication is, like, and no matter what their cognitive skills are either. I have done research, both with People with stroke but also with brain injuries. So I've worked with people with lots of different levels of cognitive and language disorders. So just I guess maximizing as much as we can ways for people to express themselves.Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life. It could be happy. It could be sad. It could be from when you were child, it could be from more recently. I guess it could be. So I have two children and one of my children is adopted and one is not so I already told the story about my son being born, so I guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption.

They are automatically going to advance after 30 seconds, but if you're ready to move on before 30 seconds, just say next.And I'll go to the next slide. At the end, there will be an opportunity for you to review any slides. If you wish to have extra time to look at any slides and then I'm going to stop sharing my screen with you and have you retell the story of Cinderella without looking at the pictures. Okay, so we can go ahead and start. just say next, if you're ready to move on, Next. Next.Next. Next. All right.Do you want to go back and review any pictures or slides? No, thanks. All right. So now and tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can, you can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it. So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away in her father remarried. Another woman who had two daughters, but they were not very kind to Cinderella the daughters. Her stepsisters were very mean to her as was the stepmother. So, as they grew up, they asked the darella to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did.So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess and the stepsisters were very excited about it and so was Cinderella. But the step mother and stepsister said, oh well you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years, and it was a beautiful dress. And she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball, and when her step sister saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together.So, Cinderella was distraught and went to a room and cried and the stepsisters went off to the ball. And Along Came Cinderella's, very godmother. And she said, oh well, you can go to the ball and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters and Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball. She danced with the prince and had a wonderful time. But remember that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were.so, she sorry, that was my"

But she realized that she had dropped her slipper on the stairs. and, And but the other slippers stayed the same, so she kept it because she had wonderful mayor memories from the ball. And later that week, the prince wanted to find the beautiful woman who he had danced with throughout the evening and he took the glass slipper that he found on the stairs and went around to every single woman in the village to see if he could find who it belonged to. So the stepmother locked Cinderella in her attic room because she had a feeling that that was her. And the prince came to their house and tried the slipper on the stepsisters, but it didn't fit them and Cinderella's animal friends.Slip to a key under the crack of the door and she was able to get out and came down just in time so that the prints was able to see her and he tried the glass slipper on Cinderella and it fit and he realized that she was the woman that he had danced with and then they got married and lived happily ever after.

        "transcript": "Let me talk about when I went to Belgium as a cultural exchange student, which was, I would say, kind of life-changing. When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio and I had the opportunity to travel as part of the international foreign youth exchange, which is a 4-H Associated organization. I was big in 4-H when I was young because I grew up in Ohio, so grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity Ohio, the state of Ohio. Since several people every year to go to a foreign country and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others, and it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up. So I always knew that I wanted to do that. And since I had taken French, all through high school, I thought I'll go to a French speaking country.In France wasn't available but Belgium was so I chose Belgium and luckily I got to go there. I soon found out that learning High School French was not what they were speaking in Belgium. So it took a lot longer to be able to communicate but it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what. It's like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there, was there for six months, most of them didn't speak any English. So I had to learn French and that's the best way to learn it. I think.But it was that when I say it was life-changing, it really kind of made me think about first of all that other people are not like us in the United States. And really got me thinking about how can I do what I do as a speech pathologist in other countries. So I immediately came home and Interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist and they said, we gotta get your master's degree back. Then you, you didn't have to have your master's degree and a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my masters in my husband, got married had children that kind of thing, but it's always been something I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full-time professor and did some, a lot of international work that way. So I was doing telepractice before it was cool actually. And got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and, and that kind of thing. So, still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. I still keep in touch with my, some of my whole families in Belgium, and we've posted kids from other countries for other programs, as well. So, you know, I think and I always encourage my children. I hope they will get just, if not steady abroad and travel.A little bit more than I did Growing Up. It just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it, Now, these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them. Tell me a story with the beginning middle and end. And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right? Over onto his dad, his dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim. Look on his face.Take a look at these pictures. That. Tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story. Also, with a beginning, middle and end and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school. When his mother said, oh, you definitely need to take your umbrell."

        "transcript": "okay, we'll just not be redundant. I'll talk about something else. I did think of another surgery that I had when I was younger was a when I was a teenager getting my wisdom teeth taken out and I think a lot of people probably have had that that done as a I'm telling you my dog just I know that messes up the transcriptions. Sorry. But anyway, what? So when I was 16 I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again I'd never really had to have any anesthesia or anything like that. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course it was an outpatient situation but since a lot of my friends had had it done before kind of new. What to expect, I think is probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then, because I know now people videotape people coming out that anesthesia but I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I had never had anesthesia before, so it was kind of interesting and I just remember being having the cotton all in my mouth when when I was trying to talk and it was rather painful I remember that too and then having just it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I hadI know from last week that you do, in fact have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. So again just share what problems that you've experienced with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help. Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research. It's been really interesting to me. Having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has Aphasia. I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing.To kind of adjust to this, but I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate, make sure that I ask questions, ask yes, no questions. I was talking with the one, Who is actually in in Mexico, they went on a trip to Mexico before the quarantine and they actually kind of got stuck down there because I don't want to put her on a plane. In. So anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit and we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So,It was, it was a challenge to help because she did have some, some probably moderate aphasian her son was on the phone too. So I was on the speakerphone. So just that whole thing of really slowing everything, down asking your questions several times, and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that was definitely definitely makes you think about all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have Aphasia and I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one-on-one communication with folks,Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad from when you were child or more recently? Again you can tell the same story as last week or you can choose a different story? A little different story. I've lost some stories. I think all speech. Pathologists have lots of stories."

You were right, I needed my umbrella and she was none too happy about that and she gave him his umbrella. And he turned around and went back to school. Take a look at this picture and everything that's happening. And then tell me a story about what you see with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can start telling that story whenever you're ready.Okay. So the little girl was playing in her yard right here, tricycle, when all of a sudden a dog ran into the yard and chased her cat up the tree, she was very upset because she couldn't get her cut down. So she yelled for her dad, who was in the house to see if he could help. So he tried to cook climb up the tree and get the cat. But he wasn't able to reach the cat either in the dog continued to bark at the base of the tree. The next thing that happened was the little girl's mother called the fire department to see if they could come and help. So the firefighters came with their ladder and they're heading to the tree as well and hopefully being able to get up there and get the cat and shoot the dog away.

It was such an immense change culturally and we're also we lived in a very rural area in New Mexico, in the mountains lived in Taos, which is the biggest town that we lived here, which is not a very big town at all. So when we came here it was absolutely shocking. I mean just the fact that they had sidewalks they're just amazing the street lamps and everything. It, I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west, and the urban areas in the East, is the East is so much more money. It's so much richer, and they can afford to do all that, you know, we had a lot of unpaved roads out there. Of course, the there's a lot sparse or populations. So a lot of times they're not going to pay these huge long roads, a little bit of life. But here, it's just amazing to us all the asphalt and concrete and steal, and the immense size of the city, it was just Indescribable the impact that it had on."

So she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got a replacement in acute rehab at NRH Washington Hospital Center. She was there for about a month and then she went back to some cute for a few weeks.And actually no, sorry she went home. Then she went back to the hospital just a few days. After returning home to have a hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting. After that, went back to Subacute because she you faced some setbacks. And then we did about a year of outpatient PT and got to about the she was not as Cooperative with that. She found it very uncomfortable and yeah, right? And we got to the point where it wasClear. She was likely to make very little additional progress, especially, given that she was not willing to, to work at home, besides doing range of motion exercises, which she does twice a day, totally on her own, just very good about that. So we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function, she could stay out of physical therapy. And she, she's doing that. And then, but we continue to do speech therapy. We've done it here for at this point. I guess almost 10 years and she's done a mix of group and individual and She gets to an adult Day Care Program, where she's very social. we don't spend a lot of time with friends outside of that.

        "transcript": "How you make me, want to think of a really good story. I'll tell you about my mom. That's probably the, like, the singular event. That's mostly. Yeah. Okay, I'll tell you a story. This is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind and I still don't make any sense. So my first semester of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa and Iowa City, but my family's from DC and I had a carSo drive back and forth over break time with my car. About a thousand miles. So generally takes about, Two days. Uh, so the first semester back, it's winter. I am driving across I-80, which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn. So it is an extremely boring, repetitive Drive. There's a lot of you know, driver tunnel, vision that happens and it's cold and gray. So it's not even pretty Green Field. It's just empty, empty, empty fields.But I'm kind of proud of myself because it's my first semester went. Well I was you know, independent excited. So I'm on I-80 and sort of the middle of Illinois. And there's a Slowdown and it's very flat so I can see a head. I don't see that there's construction. I don't really see an accident but I, you know, figure, Something's Happened. Probably a minor accident. Looks like it's a rubbernecking delay. It's kind of pissing me off I-80. At this point, is only two lanes in each Direction and there's like no exits. Nothing built along it.And we get closer and closer and closer and I still cannot see what's going on. but, this be and we get a little closer to see. Okay, it looks like I'm in the left lane and then there's a medium between the, you know, Eastbound and Westbound roots, and I'm going east. and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left and it looks as I get closer, like, an animal, Closer, it looks like a fairly large animal. I'm thinkingHow is it? A moose. I mean, it would be a moose in Illinois, but it looks it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it. So, I'm a little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes going, why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal wasting my time. I just want to get home. and I get closer, and I can see that there's these I know, large hind legs. So, it's oriented where basically? It looks like the butt of the animals, basically facing the car. There's kind of a long tail and it's brown, and it's this big hump. Oh my God. And I get, I'm getting closer and closer and closer and I, you know, my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern Magic.Thing, I don't. It's not a cow. That's a deer. It's too big to be a dog and I'm literally, as I'm passing it. Like my head is to, you know, we're just creeping along. My head is, sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view. And it's only till it's like, At my shoulder and I passed it that it my mind kind of pattern matches and goes, it's a kangaroo. You have to turn around. Look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me and I felt like the next five miles going. No, wait, okay, but it wasn't. Anything else? It was angry.Clearly kangaroo, I saw the ears. I saw the big mess of tail. I saw the big kind legs as a little tiny front legs. It was a Kanger. And so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know. I just don't, I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo. And I've even certain, I mean this was Okay, so this was the winter of 2000-2001. So the internet was a, yeah, that's not like Google was around, but there weren't really if you didn't know how to"

I kind of need that like that chapter was closing and something new with opening but I would like I didn't know where it again. Is how I was in the Haverhill Public Library.Aware of that. The book fell off the shelf, like I didn't touch this book. Like this book fell off the shelf and it was called Spirit jumpy by this woman in Gabrielle Bernstein. And I opened up that book. And my whole life changed after that, she broke down. The gift of healing of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I had never heard of and I went to a Catholic school and was kind of like religion is like politics and soft for me and she just opened up this door that you can heal through this.Way of prayer and is asking for help with something that was so foreign to me, it's just ask for help. And so I started doing her. Writing exercises. I started doing her meditations like I just threw myself into this lifestyle. I started praying every nicer praying, every morning. And I started noticing that my life was getting lighter, that I was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have before because I was blocking myself and she's showing me this box. So picking up that book and dedicating myself to spirituality in the biggest thing being meditation. She had no except she wasn't like, oh, you can't really meditate like do two minutes. She was like, sit down for five minutes.And for this is so important. And that book led me to daily prayer to meditations to traveling like far beyond. What I ever thought that I was writing up to do that, led me to India where I became the yoga teacher, it's like me to meet Gabrielle Bernstein on several occasions. I was never podcast regularly, I share her message and I swear like I've been on the sorry for 24 years but I didn't start living until two years ago. I found my book on my shelf now, like I think about my job and how I could get back up in people and how I keep traveling and how I care for my family and how I can care for people.the number one, priority above starting a family or starting a career is to continue with this meditation practice and to give this piece back together, just make that my Foundation.

She doesn't try to sneak out the fair godmother appears first, and then like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess, then she turns her gown into like this beautiful ball gown.She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods in the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into carrot and like her animal friends, turn into horses. And so, then she goes to the boss, she makes his late grand entrance. and the prince is like, very fascinated with her and so they have a dance but one of the conditions of this magic from the Fairy Godmother was that it expires at midnight so, she's dancing with him and the clock strikes, like, symbolized that the time or like midnight is coming."

And then when she grows up she is kind of like taking on this, a maid for the evil stepmother and the evil step sisters, and they all like tell her to like clean the floor and wash the dishes and like make their food and stuff like that. And eventually one dayThe king of this Kingdom that she lives in decides. He's going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his son.

But Cinderella has to leave because her magic wears off it midnight which is stupid. That doesn't make sense to me if it's magic. It should just work but she leavesProbably for a good plot point and returns back home as herself, not in her like Gallant dress. But she left behind a glass slipper which the prince finds and the prince is mystified by her and decides that he's going, he has to go and find out who she is. So he rooms the land fitting, a shoe onto Fair maidens. Trying to figure out if they're the one who we danced with because apparently, he just can't remember her face.

And then she shows up downstairs when the prince is like fitting, the shoe onto the stepsisters feet and like their feet are like way too big and like, are squishing in. So he's like disgusted and then he sees her and like, kind of instantly knows it's her but then like has to put the shoe on because once again, I guess he can't just remember her face.

But I one of the issues I've always had this swim team is that I would love going to the practice and talking with the people on the teams but whenever we would compete was when I would get like super nervous, I would be very on edge and there were times where someone had asked me like I need you to do this race for me or like I can't do this race and they'd ask me to step in and the idea of likeGoing into a situation and saying, okay, I only have to do these few races, whereas something that, like, kept me, calm during those. So when someone would have come up and say like, hey, I need you to do this, razor, I need you to do this. It would like throw off my balance and it'd be like, I can't even swim anymore or something like that, but there were sometimes where it worked out and sometimes it didn't, but overall I was still there and I still wanted to help the team.

When all the sudden a dog came up and started barking at them. The little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree and Little Sally was worried about the cat. So she went and found a ladder. She was gonna put the ladder up by the tree. One of the young man walked by and said, oh no don't worry about it. I'll get the cat out of the tree at which point the dog came back and scared the man and he ran up into the tree.A little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree. So she had to call the police, the fireman so that they could come and rescue everybody. I will tell you about having my tonsils out at the Christmas. I had had strep throat five times in one year, and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to have to come out. Which most people thought really was weird because an adult and I still had them at all.so my sister came into town to stay with me during that week while I was Getting them out. and, I had to go to Scottsdale, I think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done but they did it like on a day surgery. But what I remember about it, most is a it hurt but my surgery was scheduled at like, 11:30 in the morning but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So, by the time I got in there, I was like a little bit dehydrated. So they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me like six times in order to get the IV in.And that was very, very unpleasant. they finally got it in took me into the little hospital room and I remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, oh, that's gonna be great. You're gonna give me drugs and I'm listening to Pink Floyd. So this is gonna be good day. So did that lay down on the gurney? They gave me the IV. And then the next thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery.And my throat hurt. It was painful. I felt I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurts so bad. They were trying to give me like some water to help kind of soothe out my throat and I couldn't swallow it. So it was coming back out of my nose. It was just, it was a mess, it was horrible, but the whole thing probably took like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out, but it was like 12 hours of torture for that. And that was the Friday before Christmas, that they came out.So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles, you know, people are like oh you always get ice cream, you get ice cream but I'm lactose intolerant. So I can't have ice cream so that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt. It was burning my throat. And it was probably. It was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that and I've had people ask me, you know, if you had to do it all over again, I was I I'd have just I just continue to have strep throat. That's what I would continue."

And so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across. What I do is I offer her extra time. Sometimes extra processing time helps Sometimes we can do a pan of mine with is it this touch? If it's an object maybe we can pull the object like a cell phone or whatever.Sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a little better than actually finding the word in her mind, but visualizing it. And then because we lived with each other and we're together so much. I can kind of read her mind for the most part and know what it is. She needs like today with I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring and I figured that maybe they didn't.Take her credit card. So for the most part I can kind of guess. So a little bit like Vanna White is it this is that that does it begin with the letter sometimes beginning letters help. So that's all we work it out. My husband and I have were in Washington DC doing some sightseeing and it turned.

You know, walked in between some of those very expensive homes and started climbing. little that we know we really got ourselves in in a lot of trouble doing that there were times where we were actually,Hanging on to Cliffs are trying to climb up Cliffs, you know, just to just to get from one point to another about halfway up, we're sitting on this rock after we helped each other of this difficult spot and I said to him, I said, man, there's no way we can go back the same way we came and he says, I know and I said, I'm serious, he goes, so am I? And so, we knew the only way. The only thing we figured what we had to do is make it to the top and hopefully there would be an easier way we come back on the other side. But then we was still have to hike all the way back around the mountain, to get to our car.Uh, to make a long story short, you know, we were all scuffed scuffed up. We were tired, scratched up, close torn, but we can finally see. We're kind of getting to the top. As we were approaching the top, we saw more people up there. And older people younger people and we couldn't believe it. That, you know, these people, all these people hadn't made it to the top and we had such a difficult time. So when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people, we said we asked them, how'd you get up here? They said, oh we took this Trail, you know, down here on the other side. And we couldn't believe that there was a trail. So after that experience, you know, I think God for helping us through it because it, it really, it really made me understand why people had to be rescued from Camelback Mountain. I understand how people can get stuck, while helicopters have to come in and rescue people off of Ledges. But prior to that experience, I I couldn't understand how good people get to a certain place and not get back down the same."

So just go home and drink liquids and chicken soup and whatever they had sore throat Friday night, slept all day, Saturday, slept all day Sunday,And felt like crap a little bit better. Went to work Monday, and then still kind of felt tired, the rest of the rest of the week. And that was swine flu. So it wasn't as traumatic as I thought it would be but still felt like crap."

Stiff neck. So I switch the telephone around to the other side and the volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to this side and was much quieter. So I figured there's something wrong with the ear on my left ear is not hearing the way it should. Anyway went to the ENT specialist and he diagnosed it as an acoustic.

They keep you out because they don't want you moving around the surgery, involves cutting a hole in the head so they can get into where the nerves are. Get the tumor taken off of it. afterwards, it was a recovery that took Oh, we could ten days before we recovered enough to be able to come back home. I had a nice scar up this side of the head, kind of shaped like a light bulb.And they put a stereotype on it. The kind of hide it. Keep it sterile.

Verbally.and so basically the only way that you can communicate with them a lot is by their affect By the way, maybe their eyes, how their eyes are turning in or out, or if they're looking at you the way that you touch them. Maybe just communicating some of them. Well,I have several classes, there's another class that's m-o-m-d which is a little more advanced and so in that class we communicate by sign language like this would be you know, please or you know something like this like it's the doctor or the nurse so sometimes we do sign language with those kids and we can communicate within that way. Okay, the beginning of the story, it looks like there is this little girl probably between an 8 and 10 year old little girl. And somehow, I don't know how she got into a raging River, but it looks really cold.and, The. Fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her and he has all his equipment on and basically he has to go out into this raging River and he's grabbing on to some kind of tree limb. A branch or something for his support. And then he's got some kind of a build or something, to pull her in, or to help her.To help her in. But he's also out there. In danger in his life, too. Hey there's this little boy probably 10. 12 years old then he's out playing soccer. Just having a really fun time and the ball goes through. possibly maybe the neighbors window or maybe it's his own front window and The ball land are. Knocks over a lamp. So actually it breaks the window glass and also a lamp.And the man was sitting in a chair and then he picks up the ball and he looks out the window and that's all in those pictures. So, I don't know what the end of the story is. I don't know, the little boy does Okay, I love this one because this is typical typical of kids and mothers. Okay, so the little boys getting ready to go to school. He has that pack on and his mom says, I think it's gonna rain today. We take the umbrella umbrella. And the liberal groups? No, I'm not going to take it. It's not going to rain.Trust me, okay. Kids think they're smarter than the parents, but they're not. And the mom says you need the umbrella. But he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside and it starts to ring hahaha. And so the little boy comes back home. And he's he's soaking wet and he comes back in and his mother is a little upset with them because in her mind, she says, I told you. So why don't you listen to me? And he's stopping with. And so, he takes the umbrella and he goes to school, and I hope you learn to listen to always listen to your mom."

I mean it was she was down in just the pain, you get all this Stuff and your neck and just swallow you going like Frankenstein, it was very scary. Very, very scary. But I credit. Well yeah, God and the chiropractor was he did a lot of immune stuff and She did graduate, she was able to finish school, she got to State because she had already qualified before she got sick, and actually meddled, not in all the events, she wanted to change it to get to do her High."

This is a very special time for you and you certainly don't want your mother in law here. He said, yes, I do.And Gordon said why don't I go back to the apartment and you stay here with the children and then you can call me when it gets here and tell me what it is. And I looked at Rick and he said, yeah, why don't you do that? and I said, well right if you were sure, well it took all night long and Rick was on one side of her bed and I was on the other side and we just had the most delightful evening, Pam wasn't enjoying it all that much but Rick and I wereAnd when the baby really started to come and the doctor was there and of course, I was still there and Rick was still there and I wanted it to be a girl. I was an only, girl, my daughter was my first child, and she was a girl and we're all named for my father. We carried his family name down and I wanted this one. The first grandchild to be a girl, so I could have the name carried down again, and payment had an ultrasound and they told him this boy,And if she was so afraid, I was going to be disappointed and I was looking and looking and trying to see and finally the doctor looked up at me and he said, Grandmother, if you'd move back just a little bit, I might be able to catch this baby when he comes out. So we laughed and he didn't catch the baby. But when it came out it was my girl. Wasn't a boy, they made a mistake on the ultrasound and well my name is Evelyn. Brewer Smith, family is Pamela Brewer Smith, Foster and that baby is Rachel. Brewer Foster.So like that, that was my and to be there and to actually see her born. Of course, the doctor gave her to Rick first and then Rick gave her to me. And so I laughingly say, I always love my son-in-law but never quite as much as I did that night.

And so she cleans the place with all the help of the Woodland creatures who like the way she sings like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know I think bumper shows up So she cleans the whole place and it sparkling and then she yawns and falls all across the bed. There's seven of them and she just Falls all across the minute. It's about her height, give or take. and so, she passes out thereAnd about this time of the dwarves are Marching home from work. Hi, ho. Hi. Ho, they work in the minds. There is Doc happy grumpy Dopey bashful. Sneezy. Happy. Sleepy sleepy. Sleepy's the seventh. Okay. So there are those seven dwarfs and they work in the minds Gathering, precious, gyms and whatnot. AndThey become a marching home because, of course, it's their home. There are seven little beds for seven little dorms. And they enter their home. And they see this strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men. It doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that. Um, and,So she explains her situation and because she's so doll-faced and innocent looking, the dwarves are all like yeah. Okay. I believe you. You can stay with us as long as you're in danger. As long as you keep cleaning up the place and like make our food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she's cool that And so, she lives with them, happily for some time. And then, The evil queen has been sitting smug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day, she Saunders up to the magic mirror and she says mirror mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, Still Still Snow White.Still. You didn't kill her. And the evil queen flies into a rage. And she decides if you're gonna do something right, do it yourself? You probably kills the Huntsman. Which probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. So she goes down to her there where she makes all her potions, because as an evil queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion.That she dips a white Apple into and pulls it out and it is red as blood and it is of course a poison apple. Because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples. Hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking. I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified. But then she describes herself as this old Crone and she marches off into the forest. I'm not, I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her.And all the dorms are off to work and Snow White is sitting in the house. Singing at her animal friends, probably and Snow White enters the door. And says oh look an old Crone with a magically delicious. Looking Apple. I'm probably completely safe. And the old friend says, would you like an apple child? And she says yep. Still say and she takes the apple and the Crohn says yes child. Eat the apple."

        "transcript": "Snow White. Thanks to her Sylvia. I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all, and she takes a bite of the Apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite. And then she collapses and the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm gonna be real. The first fight that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like I can only like get a wedge out. And then from there, I can take proper bites. But apparently Snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as in human Beauty.so, Anyway, she collapses the apple rolls out of her hand, the Crone cackles maniacally as you are want to do and runs out. and then, I mean I assume she like hobbles out because she's still a crown. Maybe she no she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway. But anyway, the old Crown hobbles away. And all the dwarves come hi-hoing home.And they see Snow White passed out on the floor and they're like again. But then they realize that she's not breathing. Too well, or at all. and so, They? Get on the backs of deer. I think like they ride deer. To go find out who did this? I don't know how the deer are tracking. This chrome presumably. She just leaves a really obvious Trail. But they follow her. and, I don't know. There's a, there's a lightning storm or something I think.and, The Crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer. Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her. And like, they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car specifically, and I believe it. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying. Um, but anyway, antagonistic deer with Tiny bearded. Men writing them. And so she's understandably freaked out and she climbs up onto this mountain and she's trying to hang on to the edge because she's about to fall, and then lightning strikes. The steak she's holding on toAnd the ground Beneath Your Feet crumbles and she falls, presumably to her death. But probably not for sure. In case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development, they did that in Rapunzel and tankled. Other golf is probably dead. Hope she's dead. She was scary. Um, So, the evil queen as the grown Falls to her death. And all the dorks were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying you better go check on Snow White and so they race back to Snow White but she's still dead.And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin which doesn't seem very practical again but this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. and they put her in this glass coffin and their morning her and their flowers and tears, and three wildebeests crying and Suddenly the prince from before rides up, on his beautiful stallion. And he says, what the heck, pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm gonna kiss her because that is the logical Next Step.So then, he proceeds to lay one honor. And she wakes up. I assume she like, just Hawks out the bite of Apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the Apple. And took it out of her mouth. And that was censored. That seems logical. Because if he's going to kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Um, good to go home. Yeah, and so she sits up. And thank goodness, the lid of the coffin. Had been lifted for him to kiss her because otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again. Because she does that a lot."

And so he doesn't know how creepy this is. But he also kind of wants to eat her so he's a little bit aware of how creepy this is. And Red Riding hoods. Like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers.And the Wolf says shortly, what you got in your basket any rifles through a basket because obviously he can take it, he's a wolf and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own because that's smart. and, Not sure what happens. I guess, he just He's like, he talks to her. That's what it is. He talks to her and he says What you're doing with this basket kid? And, because she's six years old, not very smart.

She is up in that Hill, you take the left at the lightning struck tree, and he right at the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger and then you just keep going straight over the bridge and there's my grandma's called and she gives him really explicit instructions to how to get to her Grandma's College.And the Wolf drops the basket and he says, oh that sounds great. Bye. I'm never gonna see you again. Don't look free at your Grandma's place. I'm definitely not going there.

Because she's singing along to that heavy metal music, so he opens the door, he knocks Grandma out and ties her up and put her in the closet. Where she just sits there kind of sniffling and hummingblend Zeppelin to herself. And he turns down her crazy too and gets into her bed. No.Now, yes, to make. He has to take your clothes first. He's a weird wolf. Social graces, not his Forte. He? Gets grounded on to her underwear, puts on Grandma's nighty, and like her cap and stuff, he doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too. He puts on her nightcap. And then he ties her up and stuff during the closet to sniffle and hamlets up. And he gets into her bed, he pulls the covers up right here. And wait for little red, white input.And literally writinghood comes up to Grandma's door, eventually. Probably like half an hour later. and, She knocks on the door and the Wolf says, Oh Come.

First response is. Hi Grandma. I'm six and I'm stupid.And she goes up to the bed and her grandma says, oh her grandma. The wolf says, oh, what? I do. Bring me dear and she says, well, I brought you stuff from my mom because I heard you were sick from dancing, naked in the rain. You need to not do that. So often and, the wolf says, okay.

Okay. Thank you. Okay. So here is another set of sequences. And again, I just you can take a look at the pictures. Take your time. And then tell me a story with the beginning. A little, and an end. Small child has a history of violent behavior and so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school, because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checkedweather.com this morning and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain. So he's probably okay.Into the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds onto the umbrella and lo and behold us he's walking to school.

So it's kind of You know, immaterial at this point. For small child. You should not hit people with things. This wouldn't happen.That's all right. And this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right. It was a nice morning and this bird was in the tree singing. Point the cat but to itself or a cat I'm supposed to chase Birds. I've not been living up to my pop potential and so the cat climbs the tree,Only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow. And the cat is not really about that and so it just kind of gives up on the bird. And goes to the end of a different branch because you can't get down. So, we may as well look, like he did it on purpose. At which point the little girl riding by on her tricycle. Sees the cat. And thanks to herself that cat needs the recipe. Because I'm nosy. And so, she goes and she reaches for the cat. But cat is too scared to come down and it's certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms, because it's a cat and they're ornery.And so, the girl goes and gets her dad. And the dad comes back with the ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up. With the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kinda Narrows out there and he's not really about that. So he goes to climb back down the ladder. when the dog notices the cat, it's just a stray, dog. He lives by the school that, you know, goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet it. It's a nice dog but it sees the cat.And it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident. And so the man is stuck in the tree even though He could jump, that's not that tall. The man is a big old baby. And he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking. Barking up the right tree. And so he pulls the cell phone out of his pocket. It's probably a flip phone.

And so you spread that on there, you don't want too much. Um, It's a centimeter of peanut butter.So maybe that's a little too thick, but that's the idea you want like a decent amount of peanut butter. And then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it. Because you don't want to wash it off in the sink and get on another knife, it sounds like a lot of effort. Let's be frank and then you put the lid back on the peanut butter, put it back in the cabinet. You pull the jelly toward yourself, you unscrew that, you set the lid down.

But that's not important because what is important. That when she was a little girl little cheerful grown very nice. Her father remarried. Not very nice woman who had two, not very nice daughters. Who had big noses and Angry Eyes. and, Basically. I'm pretty sure her father died also. I don't remember that from the movie. I figured it must have been you know, too tragic for kids.But grandfather's thing they kill everybody's parents off. So Cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters and no parental. You know, oversight that actually cares about her. So, she grows up as basically the servant, basically, the slave of his family. She doesn't get paid. And her only friends are the cute little furry animals, like mice, and dogs, and horses. There's a cat.In Lucifer, I'm pretty sure. Aptly named. There's a cat named Lucifer Who belongs to the step family, who is always terrorizing her, my friends. And sent them. They're all you know, good buddies. They sing songs together. and then, One day, the king and the castle up in the distance very far away. Cinderella looks longingly out the window because she wants something she can't have because that is the fundamental past of human existence.The king says to his advisor, I want my son to get married because he's getting on in years and he wants a grandkid. It's pretty much is his only motivation for that. Which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your Heir Apparent to get married to me. but, The Heart Wants What It Wants. And so he decided the king decides to throw this enormous ball. To which every single eligible, Maiden in the Kingdom will be invited.And by eligible Maiden, I mean, probably over the age of 13. And not already married. The trouble is probably negotiable. So, the step family and Cinderella. Get the invitation and they're all psyched, because this is great. One of them could marry the prince not Cinderella obviously because she's hideous and not worth it but one of the stepdaughters could. And so leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited and Cinderella.Her mice and bird buddies. Make her a dress because they want her to go to the ball. Also because they're just nice, they're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this, and she gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball. And she puts on the dress, and she goes downstairs to meet her step family, at the door them to get into the carriage, to go off to the ball. And they say to themselves. There and they rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable. So she can't go to the ball because they're meanand, At this point, Cinderella is kind of grind to herself and I'm inclined to be like crying to herself because she's a baby but also I would probably cry. Because that was a nice stress. And like if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she's sitting there crying and all of a sudden, her fairy godmother comes. Why she has a fairy godmother, nobody's really sure. Presumably because she's so, pure of heart. but a very long as it comes, And says bibbity property. Boo And everything is wonderful and the Pumpkin turns into a carriage, the dogs turn into Hors."

So she has this little basket of goodies and she says, go straight there and just come straight back because the woods are scary and there's bad stuff in there. So Little Red Riding Hood is on her way. And she is not paying to do her mother and she's frolicking and such andCommunicating with little Forest creatures anyway and she comes up on the wolf in the wolf says, hey, what you got your sack, so he looks good or basket and he's like, oh that looks delicious. Who does that go to? And she's like, it's going my grandma and so I was like, oh well, that's nice. Can I have it? She's like, no wolf, it's where my grandma. And so he was like, well, I will get this basket. So he goes to Grandma's house. Because he's going to dress up as grandma and get the basket of food but when he gets there Grandma really goes in the hard time and he has to eat her. So he eats grandma and then he puts on Grandma's clothes and he gets in the bed. And so when Little Red Riding here gets there,He acts like he is sick, which she thinks that Grandma's probably old and sick. Anyway, so that is not concerning to her. So she comes in and she goes over to the wolf and obviously it's wolf, but Little Red Riding Hood, maybe she has poor eyesight, I'm not sure. But anyway she goes up to Grandma, who's really the wolf and she says, oh grandma. What they got that? You have he's like oh there's and then she talks about oh no some other body parts that are big or odd or something like that and wolf is an excuse and thenShe says what they take you have and then he says the better to eat you with and then they run around, they run around. But while that's happening, there is a lumberjack Lumberjack theme. So this Lumberjacks out in the woods and I said he looks like Santa Claus in that book. And he comes in and he splits the wolf right open and then Grandma hops out. And grandma is safe and the lumber. She invites The Lumberjack to eat with her for the meal, but Grandma still sick. So she just gets in the bed and I think maybe the lumberjack Thanks for Grandma. It's cute. And so he sticks around to take care of grandma and to be the man of the household. And now Little Red Riding Hood has a grandpa and that part, but I like to think that's what happened. The wolf, got the bat in."

So this guy comes along and he has a letter, and he thinks that he is going to help this little girl, get the cat out of the tree.and then, He while he's up there, he accidentally kicks the ladder over. So now he's stuck. And the cat is still sucked little girl. Obviously does not care.

This dog, it seems as though it's violent but I think that is probably after the cat rather than the man.So, I think he should probably just be able to yell at the dog and jump down and get rid of this dog is not. It does not look very violent. Now I don't know who has called the fire department. I'm assuming that this guy has not and judging from this picture, this is before anyone had cell phones, so I'm going to blame the old lady who lives across the street whose house.

This really, really mean woman who had these really, really terrible daughters and so they all move in together. And I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean woman wouldn't be married in him, but when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really, really meat Cinderella. So,Cinderella is man. She's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do. And so she's pretty much a slave again. I don't know where the dad is doing all this but So she works for a long time because in the story, it showed her as little girl, and then later on, it's like eight years later. So, apparently, this happened for a long time, this girl is gonna need some help. So, sheIs still. Working for the family. And then she, I don't know. Has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time. And then there's that castle and she's like, oh, those where other people live, who I'm sure have a great life. So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that. For the print so he can find a wife. I don't know, this sounds.Very crazy. I'm saying it, but it's true. So they had this dance so that the prints could find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently again, her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants, but her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come, but she thinks she's gonna come. So, she gets the Tron, the outfits and stuff, and sing songs, probably in the movie and birds, and things like that. Help her get ready. And then the stepsisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book, they take her necklace and Terror dress, and all those other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top but they do when they're really mean and so she has to stay home. Well, I guess you probably cries or something happens. That causes the Fairy Godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubs a lamp in there, it's maybe she read a book. I don't, I don't remember that part but anyway, she has this Fairy Godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So,She asked her fairy godmother, I guess to go to the dance. I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. Like this is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that like one night is gonna help but anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So the very godmother like it's all her stuff and gets her all gussied up and then puts her in a pumpkins and away. So she gets to go to the dance and it looks like she had a nose job. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much much smaller in her hair is much much blonder when she goes to the dance. So, Something happened and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance and the low and behold the prince falls in love with her. And so then she knows, she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off with the glass shoes. Anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken him off 15 minutes after getting there, so she lost her shoe and then all the prints knows that girl, he loves wore this shoe. SoHe sends his lucky guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe. And It's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit."

But the simplest way. Is just get us, get a knife. You know, get some peanut butter on there and then spread it over one piece. And then take the knife and then dip in the jelly spread, over the other piece, it's gonna be harder with the peanut butter, because peanut butter is real sticky. And if your bread is really soft, it's gonna tears, could be really careful.And think about the jelly is that it's really clumpy, so it might take a watch like Smooth out everywhere. and so, then you just put the two pieces of bread together, so that the peanut butter and jelly stick to each other and then you eat it.

        "transcript": "The game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other. And points in the sport are called runs The way that the that the playing field is set up, is there's a diamond and there's four bases at each point of the diamond, the the Diamond is on one point and such that the the bottom point is called Home Plate and then going counterclockwise Around the Clock. There's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate,The team that is in the field and is on defense, they are allowed to have gloves and there's a ball that that is in play. the other team that is trying to score the runs at that point is has a bat and they have some protective equipment, including helmets and such the way that the the game starts is one team is on defense. So they take the field and there's certain positions for each player. There's nine active players per side, so the defensive team has nine players out in the field,The offensive team has one bat player on that starts at home plate, and he's called the batter. The team that is in the field, first is the visiting team to the, to the stadium, the home team. I take it back, visiting team backs. First the home team is on the field first The way that the game is set up there are nine what are called Innings and inconsists of where each team gets the bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs. And then they switch sides where the the home team then comes to that and the visiting team then is in the field.And then they get three outs. Once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning and you do nine of those sets. In the defensive position. There's the you know there's several different positions. There's nine positions one of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher and then at home plate, is The Catcher And then we go around. We go have a first baseman, a second baseman, the third baseman There's someone that stands between third and second base called a short stop and then beyond the diamond is a is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out and and their goal. The defensive goal is to you. There's two ways you can make an out, you can catch the ball in the in the fly. I actually three ways an account. Now, catch the ball on the fly. If the batter hits the ball and the picture throws the ball towards home plate, the batter hits it.If the batter hits the ball and someone in the field, catches it for hits the ground, that is one out. There's something called balls and Strikes where if the batter misses with his back and the pitches in a certain location relative to the person's body and the in the actual physical base at home plate that's called a strike. It's outside that lateral movement. It's called a ball. You get three strikes. In your or you're the better is out. Or if you get four balls in the battery, gets a free trip to first base. so if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman, before the batter gets the first base, then that matter is out, if the batter makes it, the first base before, The throw gets there, he gets to, he is safe on the first."

        "transcript": "The bases are safe spots where they cannot be out if they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. So that's another way that an out can be generated. Let's see, the way that a run is scored. Is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first second third and then touches back onto home plate? That's one point or one run. I mentioned that there's a field Beyond The Diamond. There's usually a fence behind that those, those players that are in the Outfield, it's called The Outfield. If the batter hits the ball,Over that outer fence. Then it's a home run and so he gets a free unimpeded trip around for each base, and that's a point. If the batter hits a home run in there with someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around, and he scores a point. And then the batter gets a point, so it's a two-run homerun. So you you try to get more points or runs before. You are all of your 27 outs or exhausted. If you are taught both teams, have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning. Then it's a kind of a sudden death, like, whoever gets the most runs where both teams equally have a chance to score runs after that, they win the game. So if you're tied in the night and then the visiting team comes up first, because they start the game, they start batting, they score run, they get and then they get three outs, the other team doesn't score. They get their chance, they get three outs with no runs, then to visiting team is won the game.There's no time the games can conceivably last forever. The the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs of and have more points. Some of the strategies that people employ. Are you want a really good picture to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball and there's different types of pictures or some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow. And then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So because if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm, and throw the ball, the first base, and before, that matter gets there, then they're they're valuableFor the offensive team, some skills that you want. Is you want someone that is strong, that has really good hand-eye coordination and that that can hit the ball bar and hard. Some specialized players are there their skilled at speed so if you have someone that is marginal hitting but he's fast. And they can hit the ball and but they're fast the first space and can get there before the other team is able to get the ball. Then that's That's a valuable valuable position as well. it's basically the just"

And it took a long time for me to recover back in those days, they kept this in hospitals forever and I was there 15 days on the 10th day? I actually hammeredKnow. But other than that, I can't remember too often much about it. Like I say, I didn't have terrible pain. some discomfort at first and then it was just a matter of lying there in the bed recuperating and I had I wasn't allowed to get up to go to the bathroom because I had a catheter for at least the first 10 days and that was the nicest thing in the world, but managed and they kind of pampered me. So it wasn't too bad.Present. Okay, so we're ready to start. Well, unfortunately, my husband has parkinsonian syndrome and it has affected his speech. So that he doesn't tell, always pronounce distinctly. And the worst thing is, the volume of his voice is just faded away and it's difficult to hear him. And so if I have to ask him to repeat it, sometimes he gets irritated about that but he can do a little better. If I ask him to try a little harder than he. It's better. It's more this thing.Thing that I recall, I was extremely frightened. When my 13 year old son, ran a huge hook into his hand and had to be rushed into emergency, and then it was so painful for him to have this big hook. I took him to the hospital with a hook in his hand because we were afraid to pull it up. We might do further damage and so he was sent to the Hand Group at Jewish hospital and they had to open his hand and remove it because this hook had left the rusty path.But it was very fortunate that it sort of pushed everything out of the way, as it entered his hand because otherwise, they were afraid that he was going to have bone and tendon damage, but he healed fine. And there were no bad side effects from it. There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water and it very, the current is very rapid and she's extremely frightened. But someone else, maybe she was white water rafting because this other person has on a life preserver, and he is trying to save her. She's holding, he is holding on to a tree and I imagine that she is further down. I can't see her hands.but they're both hanging on for dear life and I'm sure he's there to try to help her Johnny plays soccer with the school team. And so he's out on his front. Lawn practicing one day, kicking the soccer ball around and oops, unfortunately, it hits the window and smashes through. Going into the house where his daddy is City. And the ball knocks the lamp over in the daddy is registering shock."

I on paper only I guess I've lost maybe a hundred thousand dollars. But as long as you know, sell nothing. You haven't lost it, if you understand what I'm saying, that's where a lot of people. And I don't understand the business World telling these people especially that the mutual fund Brokers and that telling people to cash their stuff inAnd go to a mutual fund. Well, that's To me, that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example. I've got a lot of Procter & Gamble. And it was up. Oh. Last last summer I guess around, 74 dollars a share. Right now it's about 48 or 49. Now to tell somebody to sell that. and take a 30-35 share loss. It's kind of ridiculous to me. But now that I guess that's the way these agents.You know, make your money but talking to people the public into relinquishing. What they've got is that's good. Now, I don't say you should keep all Your stocks but you give them a blue chip. You know, then I mean, I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive. Shares. And matter of fact, this last Friday I went out and bought thousands shares of Ford. and also, I put in about a thousand shares of AK Steel. Now, if you really had being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier, and I watch all the news programs.especially on a Sunday when you get a lot of Diversified, you know, opinions. and, To sell the automobiles out. It doesn't make sense. but now in AK Steel, that's the same way, they were 74, dollars a share And now I put a bid in for six dollars, a share. And I'm pretty cool. It was was 576 when I started playing phone tag with the broker. And so, like I said, last Friday, I went to Fifth ThirdMeta broker there and we put in a buy for it. Now, if you don't understand when to buy means, it was selling 621 Well, that's seven. It goes down to six. Buy me a thousand shares of it. and my reason for doing that, Is. Obama wants to. Excuse me, improve all the infrastructure. Okay, infrastructure means Steel. And that's where AK Steel comes in.And all that they haven't completed. You know, through Congress. What they Wanted to do what they're trying to say. Buy American, I really don't believe in that. but, It's really going to push the American Steel up in all American Industries are going to start making recovers. But it was funny. I just listened this morning on television before I come down here. And the state of Kentucky. Is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States. they're trying to pass that right now, so that's like to me, that was the most interesting thing to me and the The worst thing was losing all that money in my age. Of course, I don't have to sell anything and I'm not going to sell it. and maybe my ears, well, my wife will But hopefully by the end, if I leave that long, it'll go back up again."

I've been sick a whole month of February with the flu. and, I finally got over the flu. Depend on several antibiotics. I still was running. A low grade fever and being nauseated at night.and, Went on for a little while, but I still didn't think it was. Right. So I went back to the doctor And that was the fifth or sixth time. I'd been in like four four, five weeks. and, For whatever reason that he doesn't know. And I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy. I thought that was kind of unusual. I had a ticket plane ticket to California andso he got on the phone to find somebody, that would do it the next day and he did find a surgeon, he would and went in for the colonoscopy, and It kind of put you out and when I got up off the table, I said, well, did you find anything? And he said, yes, and I said cancer and he said, yes. And I'm like, well what do we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday and so Monday, he explained to me, the extent to what I had.He thought it was contained within the colon but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. So, the scheduled the operation, believe it, or not two weeks down the road. And I said that I'm going to California. I'm not gonna sit around here and Worry about this, you know, two weeks I just couldn't believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer they would schedule. The doctor called me that night and asked me some questions and we thought that was really unusual. I have a doctor call, you that didn't happen. Very often.and the next morning is nurse called me at 7 from the hospital and They were doing surgery. She said we can get you in Friday if you'll stay and I said, well, if you get me in Friday, then I'll stay. So I'll schedule for surgery Friday and had it and He ended up taking my whole colon although I left enough to hook everything back up. Which was very fortunate. But he thought he got it all.of course, as everybody's first question and So anyway, I was in the hospital, I don't remember. I was on morphine. and kind of, Out of it. Had trouble had a lot of trouble with my IV. And I was, like I said, I was on morphine. So All right, the ivy thing kept going off I guess because I quit breathing which is not unusual when you're on more fun I guess. But anyway they would look at that thing. Just ringing ring and ring and ring.And astronomist on. I mean, they wait 15 minutes and it's like car door. You know, the ding. Ding, ding, ding. And I saw every time I would want to sleep. That thing would wake me up. Well. after day of that, I was ready to kill something. and, They just wouldn't let it go even though we call him or whatever, they just take their sweet time.

From a sandwich standpoint, it's a little bit different from me to even think of eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I usually eat most of my peanut butter on saltine crackers.But in the case that I am really, really hungry, and I'm not just eating a snack, then I would after locating my peanut butter, place it out on the counter. I will then go And fun bread. Sometimes, they keep my bread in the refrigerator. So it doesn't mold so quick. And if I had done that, I will usually toast the bread. Because I don't like, it could be cold when I eat. Otherwise I may have taken it off the counter for my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread because they would give me the extra flavor of the crustSo once they're located my bread, I now have my peanut butter, but we go to my drawer.

Is that when I make, I usually do Straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of them, well, on one side of, but on both slices of bread, in this case, I have to go and alter my plan and have them, but the peanut butter only on the one piece of bread and I would use jelly on the other now, since I don't have a whole lot of jelly inMy house. I do keep at least one. Bought over jar, whatever you call it in my refrigerator and it'll usually always be strawberry. I just like strawberry and it's just like a it's a good default jelly so after I got it out of the refrigerator I would do the same with that. It's burning it on to one slice of bread and then smashing them together and eating it and"

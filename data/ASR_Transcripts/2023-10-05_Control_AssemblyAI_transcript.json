He may have tried to write down because he couldn't verbally express himself. And I think I remember him trying to write down information.We did a lot of guessing. And it's kind of like with babies, right? With babies, they can't speak and express themselves. You just have to figure it out. And I think that that's kind of what we had to go back to with him, was to go back and make sure that his basic needs were met and then go from there after that, well, what could it be?And a lot of times it was this. That's what he was asking for. Right. But it seemed like it was something so simple, but we couldn't figure it out. So it's one thing with a tiny child, but then with a grown adult to have to be able to decipher, because prior to death, the child, they didn't have this ability to understand, whereas the adult had lived a fully expressive life.And to have to go back and to try to explain, that's really challenging."

But they think what it is.It's a pinched nerve going up through my spinal cord have, for whatever reason, a plethora of things wrong with my spinal cord. And I have bone spurs and things like that up there. So I'm sure they probably are going to be doing surgery of some sort. Because right now I have to take pain pills to get to sleep at night. That's my only problem.It doesn't bother me too much in the daytime because it's not that great a pain. I can deal with it just at night I can't lay on my side because it hurts too much. The pain does. So I have to take a pain pill right now at night, which I don't like to do because I don't really like to take any kind of pills. The only kind of pills I take at all are for high cholesterol, so I don't like that at all.But I do take those at night so I can at least sleep halfway decent.

And then he just pined away because he lost this lovely lady and who he really had fallen in love with and wanted to make his wife. And so the king ordered one of his servants to take the glass slipper around the village and have the maidens try it. And when it was a perfect fit, he knew that he had found the one that the prince had fallen in love with.So when he went to the home of the ugly stepsisters, they tried to force their big feet into their bigfoot into the slipper, and it just wouldn't work. And so they said, Is there anyone else here in the house? And the wicked stepmother no. No. But with that, Cinderella comes running out and wanted to try the slipper, too, and her foot just went into it perfectly.And so they knew they had found the right person.

Having the flu and trying to get care arrangements made for Eli and then once that was done, just to get up off the floor eventually was the challenge.

And I think that probably I keep doing it. I keep asking the questions because I feel like the very little bit of communication she gives me or feedback, I'll take it.But that's not to say I don't use strategy. Sometimes what I do is probably not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive aggressive with her. And it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't want to know anything, and I'm like, fine, or I just walk away usually a little bit later, she will know that she somehow impacted. I think she knows she has hurt me in some way, that she knows she's now withholding the information and that my walking away is because she knows I want more and because I care. It's like we have to go through a dance, it's like this dance, to get a little bit more information.Thought I'd do it because anything I can get, I'll take. Thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. It can be happy or sad. It could be from any time, childhood to now, just anything that sticks out to you as being an important event. And whenever you're ready, you may begin.Okay?This wasn't a single time. It was, I would say, every Sunday, just about every Sunday. There were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday, and it was the highlight of my week. My grandparents, my mom's parents were just everything that I wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple and his willingness to be chivalrous. But my grandma had her own mind.It's like he, at that time, was able to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play. But he did it. So it was really important for me because I just had my mom at home to see this really healthy dynamic between two people, and everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there.My grandpa would have he always had a handful of nuts because there was a squirrel named Petey who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now, I'm sure it wasn't just one Petey. There were probably 20 Peteies, but I thought it was Petey, and I just always called Petey. And so we would feed Petey, and then we would go inside, and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of dinner. Late afternoon ish dinner.And it was always fancy, like high noon kind of dinner. And everything was always homemade and wonderful. And she laid out the table so beautifully, and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that. We would have our nice lunch, and we would all clean up.And then my grandpa would pull carrots out of the refrigerator and we would walk to this little horse stable area right near their house."

And the mother died, and the father went out, and he found another wife, and he brought his new wife in. But she had two daughters. And Cinderella, who had been the joy of her mother and father, was relegated to the Cinderellas, and she had to do all the chores for her two stepsisters. And her stepmother didn't think much of her either, so she just had a terrible time.And then there was in this kingdom where Cinderella lived, there was a king, and he decided that it was time for his son to get married. So he sent out an edict that all the eligible young attracted women in the kingdom would come for a ball. They would have a ball on a certain night. And so the invitations went out to all in Sundry. And it came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters.And they were all eligible, but her two stepsisters were not very pretty. But they got really excited, and they got oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes and marvelous this, marvelous that. And Cinderella got excited, too, and she thought it would be just great. But she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball, and she would have to help her sisters get ready. And so the night came, and they got themselves ready, and they went off in a carriage, and they were looking down their nose at her, and she was ready to cry.And all of a sudden, a fairy godmother showed up and touched her with a wand, and she turned into this beautiful dress. And then there was a pumpkin, and she turned that into a coach. And then there were some mice, and she turned that into the horses. And she made this beautiful thing for this Cinderella who wasn't going to get to go to the ball. And she had all these lovely little glass slippers.But she said the one thing, you cannot stay out after midnight. So when the clock starts to strike, you've got to leave. You've got to go before the clock starts to strike. So she went to the ball, and when she got there, the prince saw her and he took one look, and he just fell in love. And so he found her, and everybody else just had to stand back and wait, because that's all he could do, was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found.And they danced, and they danced all over the place, and everybody else was sort of put to the side. But you know what? She forgot that she had to leave at midnight. So the clock started to strike, and she remembered. So she started flying down the steps to leave, but she lost a slipper, and she flew out the door.And by this time her carriage had turned into a pumpkin and her horsemen had turned into mice. But she finally got home. I've forgotten exactly how, but she got home. And there she was again in the Cinderellas by the fireplace. And the other two daughters came home.And of course they had the story to tell. But a lot came him an envoy from the kingdom. And he said, we're trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper. And of course the stepmother said, oh, we go back to the kitchen, to the centers. We can't foo with."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ella. She was the daughter of two loving parents. Only one day, when she's a little girl, her mother dies suddenly. It's very tragic. Everybody cries.Everybody loves her mother. Her father, in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom, goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women, unfortunately, are spiteful, jealous creatures. He brings them all home to his lovely manor, where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father, partly out of heartbreak and partly out of just a really bad diet, also dies. At this point, the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy.They make her run around working all the time, and they begin mocking her for being dirty, and they call her Cinderella. Now, their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day when the prince, who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining land, decides he will marry one of his own people, or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball, and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this. They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns.Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go, too, just to get out of the house, have a bit of glamour. But of course, they won't let her, because they tell her that she would be an embarrassment. But mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball, and Cinderella is left alone, sort of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house. And she begins crying.She's crying and crying by the fireplace, when all of a sudden, a woman materializes from the flames and says, cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says, I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, oh, well, I am your fairy godmother and is within my power to grant this. So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs?And you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers, and so that will do. And she waves her wand, and the pumpkin turns into a carriage, and her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ball gown, and her slippers into slippers of cut glass, none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen. And Cinderella is just overcome with joy, and she gets into the carriage, and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairy godmother says, unfortunately, my magic power is limited. And at midnight, when the chimes go, everything will turn back.So make sure that you are well away from the ball and out of an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens. Cinderella says, I will. I will. And she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball and she arrives, and it's even more dazzling than she thought. And she comes in, and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming.And in the midst of her being greeted by throngs of enchanted admirers, the prince looks up and he sees her, and he asks her to dance. And they begin to dance. And of course, they're both super hot, so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together. And the prince is about to propose to her there and then on the spot, and the clock begins to strike twelve and she says, oh, no. Oh, I need to go.And she runs."

And so she cleans the place with all the help of the woodland creatures who like the way she sings, like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know, I think Thumper shows up. So she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling. And then she yawns and falls all across the beds.There are seven of them and she just falls all across them. And it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there. And about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work. Hi ho, hi ho.They work in the mines. There is Doc Happy, Grumpy, Dopey, Bashful, sneezy.They can do this.Happy doc grumpy dopey sneezy. Sleepy, Sleepy, sleepy is the 7th, okay? So there are those seven dwarves and they work in the mines gathering precious gems and whatnot. And they come a marching home because of course it's their home. There are seven little beds for seven little dwarves.And they enter their home and they see this strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up. And she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that.So she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent looking, the dwarves are all like, yeah, okay, I believe you. You can stay with us as long as you're in danger. As long as you keep cleaning up the place and make our food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she's cool with that. And so she lives with them happily for some time.And then the Evil Queen has been sitting smug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day she saunters up to the magic mirror and she says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still, still Snow White, still. You didn't kill her. And the Evil Queen flies into a rage and she decides if you're going to do something right, do it yourself.She probably kills the huntsman. She probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. So she goes down to her lair where she makes all her potions because as an evil Queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white apple into and pulls it out.And it is red as blood. And it is of course, a poison apple because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples. Hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking.I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified. But then she disguises herself as this old crone and she marches off into the forest. I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the dwarves are off to work.And Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her animal friends, probably. And Snow White answers the door and says, oh, look, an old crone with a magically delicious looking apple. I'm probably completely safe. The old crone says, Would you like an apple, child? And she says, Yep, still safe.And she takes the apple and the crone says, yes, child, eat the apple."

Take a look at all of them, and then I'm going to ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay? And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story.It all right. So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella, and he didn't want to take it because he didn't believe it rain. So right as he started walking outside, it started raining, and he gets mad and is stomping through the puddles, wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house wet and gets umbrella, then continues on his journey. Okay, great.So here's another picture. I want you to look at everything that's happening, and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right, so this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree. Her father thought he could rescue the cat, so he brought a ladder, placed it on the branch, and climbed up.And then his ladder fell, so he stuck up in the tree with a cat, and for some reason, the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out. So they had to call the fire department, and the fire department came, and the fire department's on their way to rescue them, to rescue the cat and the father.Great. Thank you. Okay, so now I'm going to have you this is, again, another story. Have you ever heard of Snow White? I've heard of it.Okay, that's fine. Take a time to look at the pictures. Tell a story. I want you sorry.The pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm going to take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures, okay? And then ask you to tell me the story in your own words, all right? Okay, so now just tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can, and you can use any details that, you know, prior or what you just looked at. So just what I looked at.So there was this queen who was hoping she'd be the fairest lady of the land, all right? And so she'd asked her magic mirror, which had a face in it, and she'd ask, who's the fairest lady of them all? And usually the mirror would reply, she is. But one day the mirror replied, snow White is. So the queen was upset and banished Snow White.And then Snow White was going through the forest us, and she found seven dwarfs, and for some reason she fell asleep, but they thought she was gone."

And then I think they added the cinder because she was dirty or something because she had to clean. Anyway, so there's this girl, and she had a family, and her father was little, well off, and then her mother ended up dying. And so her father remarried a woman, the evil stepmother, who had two daughters, anastasia and maybe I don't know. I remember they had, like, longer kind of mouthful names, so they ended up moving in.And the two sisters bickered a lot, and the stepmom didn't like Cinderella. And then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil stepsisters. And this is so weird to tell it. And so then the evil stepmother was like, you're just going to be amazed in the house because she didn't really like her.So she exiled her to a room in the attic, and it made her pretty much a servant. And one day, the prince, prince Charming, announced that he was having a ball, I think in order to look for a wife or something like that. And the stepsisters or the stepmother really wanted the stepsisters to go, and the stepsisters wanted to go, too, because they wanted to go meet the prince and have their shot at him to see if they could marry him. And Cinderella was like, oh, cool. Maybe I'll go.And the stepmother was like, yeah, no. And so I think Cinderella has her animal accomplices. I know one. The mice name is Gus Gus. I don't remember the other one.And her animal and the birds and stuff, the singing birds. And they make a dress for her. She's, like, looking through I think it was her mom's stuff. So she gets an old dress of her mom's, and then they make it all pretty and stuff for her. And so she's getting ready to go to the ball, and she walks downstairs to go out, and the sisters and the stepmother rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry because they don't want her going.And I think maybe they locked her a room or something. I don't know how she ends up getting out. But anyway, she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the bar, getting ready to go. And then fairy godmother appears. Okay, she doesn't try to sneak out.The fairy godmother appears first. And then it was like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess. And then she turns her gown into this beautiful ball gown. She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods.And the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into a carriage, and, like, her animal friends turn into horses. And so then she goes to the ball. She makes this late grand entrance, and the prince is very fascinated with her, and so they have a dance. But one of the of this magic from the fairy godmother was that it expires at midnight. So she's dancing with him, and the clock strikes, symbolize that the time, or like midnight is coming, and she's."

And poor Cinderella, because she was the baby of the family, always got stuck with doing all the chores. And that didn't matter if she was out tending the animals out in the barn or feeding the dog or slopping the hogs, even having to cook all the meals. And her two older sisters, they just had to run in a house. They just got to go to all the parties and play around the way they wanted to do.And no matter what Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, the grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters.Well, every year they have this large dance in town and it's to celebrate, I guess, the harvest and all of that type stuff. So they have this big party and everybody gets dressed up. There's all kind of food and dancing and so forth. And Cinderella has never been able to go. I mean, she's just always shunder because she's just the dog, sort of as far as the evil grandmother knows.So the two sisters come along and they get all dressed up and they're off to the party. Well, they're having such a wonderful time. Poor Cinderella's at home and she sort of beside herself. But all of a sudden a fairy godmother appears to her and says, cinderella, why are you sitting at home? Says, well, I don't have a dress and I have no preparations.My grandmother hates me, my sisters hate me, and I'm never allowed to go anywhere. So the fairy godmother says, well, we're going to fix that today and I'm going to get you a new gown, and in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown and gets all these fancy shoes. And I think her feet were made out of like glass slippers. They were probably like a rock crystal.So she gets transported to the dance and man, her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, with the king and the queen and the prince being there, the prince just is really impressed with this Cinderella chain.So they dance and they dance and they dance and they dance. And the day seems to go by so quickly. But all of a sudden, Cinderella hears the clock ringing and the bells start chiming. And she remembers that her fairy godmother said that, boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight or else you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person and all of this stuff is going to be washed away and everybody will know that it's just like a boy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from and in the process loses one of her shoes.But she does manage to get home and her fairy godmother collects up all her garb and everything."

And Cinderella. Unlocks the door. She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsisters feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass swept up.And everyone panics because the stepsisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the Prince is dancing with. Obviously, that's the only reason they can't prove that. And the advisor is panicking because King wants the Prince to get married. The Prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe, and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says, but wait, I have the other slipper.And lo and behold, she does in fact have the other slipper, which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why. Fairy Godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes and she shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper. And then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot.I don't think she should be able to stand in real life and puts it on her. And it fits beautifully, of course. And so there was triumphant music, and they all lived happily ever after. The princess? No, Cinderella.She wasn't a princess yet. Had to get the ring first. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind and married the Prince. Probably still doesn't know her name. The end.The end. All right. That's awesome. Is that too long? No, that's great.Okay, so now I'm going to have you do the same type thing. Oh, excellent. But for Snow White. Okay, so again, we've covered up all of the type, so just look through the pictures. Less comprehensive knowledge of Snow White.So this will probably be shorter. That's fine.She's very melodramatic. Look at this. Look at this. What is this face? I mean, I get that she's panicked, but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances.It all right, Tim. So Snowy and the Seven Dwarves just told for somebody who vaguely remembers that. Okay, so now I'm not sure if Snow White was actually a princess or something before the Evil Queen usurped her throne, or if, like, she's the beautiful cousin or something, and we're just waiting for the Evil Queen to die off before Snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there's this evil queen. She's got the high, regal cheekbone.She could probably be nice looking if she wasn't so evil. So I don't know what she's so insecure about, but Snow White is the fairest in all the land."

But the other two were spoiled brats because they didn't have anything to do with her and they thought they were something special. And them, whenever she would come in with some tea or coffee no tea because it was in a pot, some tea she would bring it to them and they would make fun of her because she was not dressed like they were. And then they didn't even want it because they didn't feel like having it then.So they complain. And she liked according to the pictures that I sort of remember, she liked little animals. She liked the mice, she liked the horse, she liked the dog, the cat. And she found peace with them. She got along with them.And finally, there was one time that someone brought her address. A man was relative, I guess, and she tried it on. She looked very pretty. And the sisters were jealous. They didn't want her to have that dress.She looked lovely, but they didn't want to admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, I have to watch you. So that was that. But then they took the dress away. And then by and by, they hear that they're going to have a big ball at this palace and they got some kind of written notice on it.And so the mother says to the three of them, heard it together, the little girl that was mistreated. And the two stepsisters, they all heard. They're all very happy. And so she says, okay, we're going to get you dressed up in the most beautiful dresses and make sure that you get the prize because I understand that he's looking for a woman.

So she puts it on. She looks beautiful. She has beads.She has a sash, and she has that's what they showed. And then when the time came that they were to go, she came down because they were dressed up. So she was dressed up now in this dress. And they looked at her, and she did look beautiful in it. But they tore the beads off, tore the sash off, took off her dress, says, you're not going to that party, only we because we look better and we'll win.And the mother is going right along with everything. So she says, you go to your room and take care of what you have to and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time, exc. So she goes back in her room and she's very sad. And her fairy godmother comes along and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? She says, Because I wanted to go to the party."

        "transcript": "Okay, so Cinderella was an only child, and I guess her father got remarried to a woman who became her stepmother. And this woman had two daughters of her own. And they quickly moved into Cinderella's house and overtook the house. And I do forget what happened to the dad. But he went off and it was just Cinderella.The two stepsisters and the stepmother and the stepmother and the stepsisters used Cinderella as a maid. And they renamed her to Cinderella because of Cinders and all the cleaning. And she was dirty. And they told her how she wasn't pretty and she was really, truly much prettier than her mean, evil stepsisters. And what would you call it?The Town. The region decides the prince is going to have a ball. And the two sisters come home and their mom and they're very excited because there's going to be a ball. And all the young women of the lands are invited. And the two sisters start planning their outfits and the mother's involved in it.And all assuming that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty and the prince would never want to see her. So the night comes, and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful. And off they go to the ball. And I think the mother may have gone as well. And she's left at home.And she's sitting out in the garden and her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother has a chitchat with her and finds out she really does want to go. So the Fairy Godmother uses her wonderful magic wand and then uses the help of the tiny little mice. And the mice are poof become the I don't know what you call it. The chariot attendant. So the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful and addressed.Her hair is all done up. She's absolutely exquisite. She takes a pumpkin. The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot. The mice become the chariot.People, they open the doors. They drive her off to the ball. She has a lovely night up. Almost Forgot. As she gets into the pumpkin chariot, which is now beautiful.The fairy godmother says, have a great time, but you must be home by midnight because all this is going to disappear. The magic at midnight. So she goes off. She goes to the ball and the prince is dancing with everybody. And of course, he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room.He asks her to dance. They have many lovely dances. And then all of a sudden, she tunes into what time it is somehow. And she says I must says no, no. And she's like, no, I really must go.She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight. She's running down the steps of the palace. She just gets into her pumpkin chariot. She leaves. As she's running, she leaves a sandal step.What you call it? A beautiful pump on the steps. As she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin. She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters and they come home and say, what a wonderful time. They kind of tease her for being stuck at home and ask her what she did and they dream about what a wonderful time.And then everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind. And he is going throughout the lands to find who spoot fits this slipper. And it's a very delicate glass slipper. And so eventually they get to Cinderella's home. The two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it.Of course it doesn't fit. Cinderella wants to try it. They think it's ridiculous because she wasn't really supposed to be there."

Then you close the two slices of bread together.Then you can cut it in half or do what you want or eat it. Bad kitty. Poor little kitty ran up the tree and her little girl over there, over there. The sister always crying, my poor little kitty, what should I do? She calls for her father to climb the tree to help get the kitty.And the dog is barking because he's worried about the father. I don't know if he's worried about the cat. And they're all worried that their kitty is not going to be saved until someone called the fire department who came to their rescue. And I hope everything is going to be fine. They would get the kitty down and the father would have to jump down and little darling daughter will be happy and be able to ride her bicycle.How come the father didn't use the ladder to get the kitty down himself instead of climbing up the tree?We'll see if the kitty is going to be saved and thank the fire department for what they have done. It happened there last in October of nine and September of eight. I was sitting in the house. The exact same things happened both times. I was taking a nap and I got up about near 05:00 and all of a sudden I went to the bathroom to urinate and I was urinating blood.And it was the scariest moment in my life. And I just got over there and I called up my son, please come over. I didn't tell him what it was and he lives about a block away and he came over and he saw me bleeding and I thought he was going to drop dead. I wrapped myself in a towel and I said, drive me to the hospital. And I went there and I went to the emergency room and it stopped bleeding.I strained my bladder or something and I had internal bleedings. And I was so happy that all it was, was an internal bleeding. They just gave me some antibiotics and they kept me in the hospital overnight. And all the tests were negative and it just was internal bleeding. And they say I strained myself moving my bowels and I was happy at the result, but I wasn't happy when I saw the blood coming out.It happened in 208 and exactly one year later, later, the exact same thing happened again. And I just said, oh, I just was cursing myself, what is happening over there? And I was talking to the doctors and I was playing."

And so she steps out on her journey, is enjoying her walk through the woods, reversing with all the woodland creatures, come up upon a wolf who is less than friendly. Big Bad Wolf that they have a conversation, he's intimidating and eventually he leaves her alone. She continues on her journey as she is continuing to her grandmother's house. The wolf makes it to her grandmother's house, scares her grandmother out and hides in the grandmother's bed posing as the grandmother for when Red gets there.And then as they go, the Red Riding Head comes up, is talking back and forth with the wolf posing as her grandmother and is gradually realizing that things aren't quite right. My grandma, what big teeth you have. I don't remember what all the different body parts are but things are not looking quite right for this to be Grandma. And she eventually realizes that it's the wolf runs out of the house. The wolf goes chasing after her and is apparently eventually saved by some sort of woodsman because she finds her grandma by a tree and then there's a guy with an axe and so that's cool.Yeah. Apparently there are like 15 different ways that Little Red Riding Hood can end up to it, including her getting eaten by the wolf. Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess I forgot to say that. But honestly, if you know a story that's not the same as the pictures, use the pictures or whatever but tell the story that you know the next one is no life.This one I can manage pretty well. Yeah. This one's not quite as well loved. No, not quite.So Snow White is similar to Cinderella in that there's an evil matriarch.So Snow White is just minding her own business in the kingdom where she lives. Of course, the Evil Queen is not happy with her because when the Evil Queen wants to inquire as to who is the fairest in the land, the answer is Snow White and not herself. That makes her not happy. So eventually she banishes Snow White out of the kingdom. Scares her off, however.Exactly. And so Snow White goes running into the woods, finds a little house that looks quite hospitable and so she goes in, just makes herself at home, doesn't really find anybody, but that's cool. Eventually the seven dwarves come home and are wondering what this woman doing in their bed is, how she got here? Why is she here? And and so eventually they sort of make a happy little life together and are."

        "transcript": "Okay, then you may tell me your story.In April 2016, I went to see Mumford and Sons, and I stayed in Indianapolis at the Alexander Hotel with a friend. And when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, I remember feeling a lump under my left armpit, my left side, and it was in a really funny location, so I was sort of surprised that I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram, and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound, and I took my friend Dorothy with me. And the oncologist who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with stage two cancer. So I called my sister, who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff, but she lives in Chicago, so she wasn't going to let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington.So I went to Chicago, to Northwestern, for what seemed like that entire summer, may, June, July. It takes many months to compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer. And especially the first time, they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they choose the best course of treatment. Especially because I was 40, they view that as young, and so it's pretty radical. So anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months and months of agony, and then ultimately have I have a bilateral lumpectomy, so they found it in both sides, actually, after all the tests, and that was removed, my surgeon at Northwestern was great, very comforting and confident, which is what I needed.And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery. The medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation. And then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. So after I had my surgery, a week later, they put my port in.And the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to where they administer the drugs for chemo. And I had treatment every other week for a couple of months. And I recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful. And you can taste them, you can smell them, but in your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells, they are doing what they're supposed to be doing.So all of that said that's I guess, how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing, being killed. After my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation, and that just made me tired, so that was okay. And then that was right. I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6. My radiation ended just after Christmas.So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments. And that's what happened."

And you can't expect the whole world to accommodate you in a small group, maybe in a large group, and by the time you get out what you want to say the conversation is miles down the road. I don't know what the answer is. He always spoke too much to be able to use devices. When Palm Pilots were first used in speech therapy in the late 90s, early 2000, medicare would not pay for them unless they had none of the additions that made Palm Pilots so wonderful and useful.It couldn't have a calendar and it couldn't have games and it couldn't have a calculator. All the functions medicare said they would pay for them if all they did was helpless speech. And we ended up with Palm Pilots around the house anyway. But he had too much verbal speech by then to use a device. So for some people who had no speech, it was awesome.And I think it still is to this day. I think for people like him, it slows everything down too much. So he just plugs along everything I can think of. Right. That's wonderful.Yeah. Now, thinking back, I'd like you to tell me about a story about something important that has happened to you in your life. It could be happy or sad from any time.It's going to take a minute. Take your time. And I'll mute myself when you're speaking to not let any sound interfere. Sure. I hate it when my mind just goes blank when I'm trying to think of something like this, something important in my life.Well, I think for any woman, I think probably the most important thing if you are fortunate enough to have that experience is having children. And it's interesting moments that stick out in your life. Never forget. You can remember all the details. And I remember when my first son was born and it was a very long affair, 22 hours.But what I remember not so much about the 22 hours and how tired I was, but I remember so clearly the delivery room. This delivery room is on the campus of IUPUI and it is now a health center for students. And I don't mean I'm not really sure exactly, I don't think there are rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing, but I think clinics type thing. But this is an old post war building and I believe it's two or three stories high and it was a women's hospital at the time I had my first two children. And the most amazing thing about this room is that there were windows and a door.It was on the second floor and it's still there. If you go to the Riley garage you can see it. There's a stairway down, a wooden stairway, no, west down to the ground level. And I remember the day that this wonderful thing happened. I remember the door was open."

He kicked it so hard, boom. It went right through his neighbor's window.And when it went through the window, it went right into the neighbor's living room, knocked over a lamp close to where man was sitting. It startled the man. The man picked up the ball and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from. Okay. There was once a girl called Cinderella.She didn't have any parents, and she lived in an orphanage.But she lived in an orphanage. And the orphanage was looking for a family to take her.So they put out a notice. A mother that had two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see Cinderella, to take her in. They saw Cinderella. The orphanage director introduced Cinderella. Cinderella did a courtsey, said, Pleasure to meet you.And they took Cinderella away. Once they got Cinderella home, cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean, and so were the stepsisters. All they made her do was chores. All day long, nothing but work, work, work. Cinderella, do this.Cinderella, do that. Cinderella, get my food. Cinderella, do the laundry. Cinderella, feed the animals, the cats, the dog, the horses. All Cinderella could do was just work, work, work all the time.Later that evening, an invitation came to the house from the king, inviting all the girls, all the unmarried ladies, to the princess ball so that perhaps a prince could find somebody to marry.And so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball, and so was Cinderella. She thought she would be going, too. Cinderella went into a bed while she was cleaning. She went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress. And so she went ahead and tried the dress on.However, when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her with the dress and also the jewelry she was wearing, she says, what are you doing? What are you doing? Cinderella says, well, we've all been invited to the ball. Cinderella and the evil stepsisters. And the stepmother saying, you're not going.You're ugly. You're staying here. Nobody's going to want to marry you. And they snatch the jewelry off of her, and they snatch the dress off of her and says, you're not going anywhere. We're going to the ball, and one of us will marry the prince, but you've got to stay home, because nobody wants to marry you anyway.And so off to the ball they went. Cinderella stayed at home, and she was crying. And before you knew it, she was crying so hard. All of a sudden, she started hearing bells, and there's twinkling all around. And a fairy godmother appeared.And Cinderella says who are you? I'm your fairy godmother, and I'm here to grant you a wish to go to the ball. And Cinderella says, well, I can't go because I don't have a dress and I don't have a way to get there. So the fairy Godmother waved her magic wand and created a dress for her. She says, oh, the dress is beautiful, but I don't have any shoes.She waved her magic wand again, and there were some glass slippers for her. So she put on the glass slippers, and now she was truly a beautiful, beautiful young lady."

And we fell off the roof at the same time. Anyway, we slid off the roof and he landed on my ankle, and my ankle was like turned completely like this, and it's supposed to be like that, so it was crushed. He landed on it. Anyway, I remember looking at my ankle and I just went like that.So we went to the emergency room and the doctor, they called in an orthopedic person and he said I'd never walk again and that my ankle was crushed into many pieces. And he told me that there was no need for plates and steel stuff to open it up. He was just going to anesthetize me and put it back together like clay because they were all little pieces. So anyway, they gave me IV morphine and he put my squished my ankle back together. I was in a cast for three months up to my hip.And it was a hard time because I couldn't move for three months. And we lived in a cabin in Fairbanks without running water and without a bathroom. We had an outhouse. So if you're not the adventurous type, that will sound really disgusting. But like I said, I was young and I went to Alaska and thought it would be really fun to live in a cabin.We had electricity, no internet then, I don't think. There wasn't anything such thing as internet anyway, so my husband took really good care of me. But I remember certain things. One was the morphine for a good day. I felt incredible love and peace, and I knew it was the morning.I'd never felt that much love or peace in my life.It was really weird. But what helped me, I think I was just determined that I would walk again. I couldn't believe that. I never believed the doctor. I just thought that was a bunch of fooey, really, because I thought in this day and age, this is just a stupid bone.And I just never believed them. And I think they protect themselves legally. I believe that firmly. And I slowly got better.I was stubborn then and I didn't do anything. The doctor told me, and I regret that. I didn't go to physical therapy. I didn't do any of that."

They go across country and all of a sudden they hit very deep, rough, rocky road and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out, still clutching its pink dog and all of a sudden looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into the horizon where it's watching it disappear. The mouse family arrives at a lovely big glen with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic. So they aisle pile out. They picnic basket the tables, various and sundry items that they need for the picnic.They spread the table down. They're beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock. They're dancing, they're playing. They have musical instruments.Either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane. They have a big basket of food. They have a thermos jug with a beverage of Miss BI's tea. The little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse and they're all having an absolutely wonderful time.

Somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook.And then we flash back to the baby who got bounced out of the truck who has still got his ladybug by his side and his doll, his pink doll. He looks all around, doesn't see much. Doll is upside down but he's still hanging on to him. All of a sudden spots a whole bush full of red berries or flowers I would assume maybe berries because the flowers on the page look like flowers.

Two or three of them are playing in the water.Somebody is sailing a boat. The baseball plug is now lying on the ground. Mother is pouring milk. One of the babies is in the salad.

And he said, yeah, I'll go kill her. And so he goes and he finds her. But then when he gets there, she's like really super nice and he feels bad and so he doesn't kill her, but he's like, hey, this lady, she's really trying to take you out, so you've got to get out of here.So she runs in the forest and stuff. Oh, yeah, before all this, she wants to marry the prince. But I don't know how she met the prince. So I don't know whether she saw a picture of him or whatever, but she likes this prince, and maybe the old lady is like a cougar and she likes the prince too. Maybe the prince is her son and she doesn't think that Snow White is good enough.I have no idea. But there is a prince, and she likes this prince or she dreams about it or whatever. So anyway, back to the lumberjack. He tells her to get out of here and she runs off in the woods. And the woods are really scary and stuff.And she runs for a long time and then it's sort of like three bears where she comes in this house and she's like, oh, I'm really tired. And she probably tries all these beds. But anyway, we only see her in one of the beds in the picture and she is sleeping. Well, while she's sleeping, the people that own the house come in and they are seven weird little dwarfy men. And apparently she does not think this is creepy.She thinks this is okay. And she becomes friends with them and they are pumped to have her staying with them, which obviously they would. She's the fairest in the land, so I don't know what she does there. Maybe she cleans. I know that they also whistle while they work and I think that they work in a coal mine or something like that.And actually, I hope this doesn't this is an aside here to this story. When I was little, I had this record that my parents put on for me all the time. And they used to laugh because I'd stand in my crib and I would sing the Dig, Dig song. But it was just me going, dig the crib thing. And so I felt I made the mistake of telling Adam.And so every once in a while when I'm working, he's like, dig, dig, dig, dick, dig dick, dick. I'm like, oh, God. So anyway, I know that they dig from the record, but I don't really know what they dig. But they whistle when they go and they whistle when they come back. So something happens.Oh, that really mean witch lady makes herself like even more ugly. Mean witch. And she comes up to Snow White and I guess she's like, I don't know, like roaming farmers market lady or something like that. She's like, I have apples. And so I thought, yay, because she's going to make like apple pie or something for the little dwarf men.And so she gets apples and she eats them and then she passes it out."

Breaks a lamp, and the neighbor grabs a ball and looks out the window to see who did it. Do I need to go on, or is that it? Okay. In the morning, little boy is getting ready for school.Mother says, take your umbrella. It's supposed to rain today. I don't want the umbrella. The umbrella is not for cool kids. And as he walks to school, he gets stuck in the rain, and it's coming down harder and harder, and he has to go back home, and his mom's upset that he's all wet and soggy and she gives him the umbrella that he should have taken in the first place, and then he walks happily back toward school.Okay. Cinderella was only child, and she had a very generous dad. And the dad remarried and has a stepmother who had two children, anastasia and Drusella. And the dad passed away. And when he died, the stepmother turned Cinderella into kind of a housemaid and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life, while Cinderella scrubbed the floors, cleaned the fireplace.But Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life, and she became friends with all the animals in the house, except Lucifer. He was a mean old cat. It was a stepmother's cat, but she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends. And she lived upstairs in the attic and always dreamed of the castle she could see from her window. And the prince I think it was Prince Philip.Prince Philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife. So he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so that the prince could meet all the girls in the village. And the invitations get sent out. And the stepmother opens the invitation and says, oh, it's going to be a grand ball. And all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince.And Cinderella overhears her telling the story to stepsisters, and she says, oh, I want to go. I'm eligible maiden. And stepmother says, of course you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done. So she makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do. She says, wash the floor.And someone says, I washed the floor yesterday. She says, we'll do it again, and she ought to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball. And as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons. And when they're done, she goes upstairs the attic and finds a dress an old trunk that used to be her mother's. And she shows the mice her beautiful dress and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away.And she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress. But the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready."

        "transcript": "Another injury. All right, so last time I'm going to tell you different. Last time, we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult, so I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother.I have an older brother, and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then, and the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get to the top of a wheelchair. I've got wheelchair in my brain to get to the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed. But I was pretty scraped up from and I decided I didn't like following suit with the shimming of a tree, so they shimmied down. I was not going to shimmy down.So my brother, he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and tried to my mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff, but no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast, so you had to stay propped for a little bit, but minus that, it was a walking cast.I was fine. That's what I remember of that. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating. But what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues, or did I'm going to have to tell the same story.So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church, where I was their Sunday school teacher for ten years and still go to Eagleari with them for special needs retreats. It's a group of about five to 600 special needs, most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities, which includes like, the big square dance. So you just help them, whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they have a hard time walking. But most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate and hear over top of it.The three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers, of which only one communicates. I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two don't. It's a series of grunts, some sign language. Over the years, I've, of course, learned the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. We have her weding ring upstairs.He brings money in his pocket. That's his dowry so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate, but through his sign. It's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying. His sister and his mom usually know, so they are communicators, but they're communicators for them, put it that way.Um, they will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer. And by facial expressions, you know?"

        "transcript": "This last spring, I was down in the basement doing some work and I decided to come flying up the steps. And I flew it. But the problem was I had both hands full of papers and I didn't hold on to the brailing, which I usually do. I'm usually careful. So I went flying around the corner and as I turned the corner and hit the third step I slipped and fell backwards and hit the wall.And, of course, I fell flat on the landing. There I was. And I thought, well, I can get up. But I couldn't get up. There was no way I could get up.So there I was, and I guess I went in and out. I don't really remember. But there I was on the landing and I couldn't get up and I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen and he's watching TV and maybe I'll be able to get up later. And I won't tell him that I was so foolish just to come up the steps and fall.So I lay there a little bit longer and I woke up again and I couldn't get up. So I just lay there, and I kept going in and out. And finally, sometime later it was at least 30 minutes he wandered by the door and the door from the floor was open down to the stairs. So he looked at and said, what are you doing down there? And I said, I can't get up.And he said, well, that won't do. So he came down and he tried to get me up and I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done. But I couldn't move. So he said, we need to call the ambulance. And I said, oh, no, I'll be able to get up.And he said, we really ought to call the ambulance. But my next door neighbor was a urologist and his wife was a nurse. And I said, well, maybe you can call them. And they came over, and the doctor looked at me and he said, Call the ambulance. So we called the ambulance, and then we called my daughter, who also lives in Lexington and she met us at the hot.That's where she came to the house. And the amulist came and the fire truck came and we got it. And they brought down because I had a neck injury, obviously, I couldn't move my neck couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body and they brought it in and from each side these two big burly men working on either side of me trying to get me up. And the landing wasn't all that wide.They finally got me up, and they didn't want me to move at all. So they carted me up the stairs. And I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about it ever since. They said to each other, she doesn't weigh as much as a six pack. So this has been the joke with the whole thing.They got me up, and they were absolutely marvelous. On the way to the hospital, they kept telling me where they were and it wouldn't be too much longer because I really was in pain. And I got to the hospital and of course, they'd called ahead. They took me straight through to Critical Care and they were ready for me. And the rest of the night I was in and out.But I had marvelous care. I had marvelous people who were professionals who were working with me all night long. And they kept trying to check and be sure. I didn't have any brain damage, I didn't have any nerve damage. But I had a broken neck.The second cervical was broken, so they had this cast on me. The minute that they were there, they had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital. But then the next morning they put on the I forgot exactly what it is. It's a J thing. It's in two pieces."

        "transcript": "Well, I've had a lot my fair share, I guess difference, but the most recent was I discovered had colon cancer last March and discovered it quite by accident. I'd been sick the whole month of February with the flu. And when I finally got over the flu had been on steroid antibiotics. I still was running a low grade fever and being nauseated at night and went on for a little while, but I still didn't think it was right. So I went back to the doctor, I think that was the fifth or 6th time I'd been in like four or five weeks.And for whatever reason that he doesn't know and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy and thought that was kind of unusual. I had a ticket to plane ticket to California. So he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day and he did find a surgeon who would and went in for the colonoscopy and they kind of put you out. And when I got up off the table I said, well, did you find anything? And he said yes, and I said, Cancer?And he said yes. And I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday.Monday. He explained to me the extent to what I had.He thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. So they scheduled the operation, believe it or not, two weeks down the road. And I said, then I'm going to California. I'm not going to sit around here and worry about, know, two weeks. I just can believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer they would schedule you two weeks down the road.The doctor called me that night and asked me some questions, which I thought was really unusual to have a doctor call you. That doesn't happen very often. And the next morning his nurse called me at seven from the hospital and they were doing surgery. She said, we can get you in Friday if you'll stay. And I said, well, if you can get me in Friday, then I'll stay.So I was scheduled for surgery Friday and had it. And he ended up taking my whole colon, although I left enough to poke everything back up, which was very fortunate, but he thought he got it all, which of course is everybody's first question.So anyway, I was in the hospital. I don't remember. I was on morphine and kind of out of it. Had trouble. Had a lot of trouble with my IV.And like I said, I was on morphine, so the IV thing kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on morphine, I guess. But anyway, they would let that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring. It was driving us on. I mean, they wait 15 minutes and it's like a car door. The ding, ding, ding, ding.And I saw every time I would want to sleep, that thing would wake me up. Well, after a day of that, I was ready to kill some. And they just would let it go. Even though we'd call them or whatever. They'd just take their sweet time getting in there.Well, my son got here from Newburn."

Unfortunately, the wife got very ill and died, and so they were very sad for a while. And eventually, the father decided that he really wanted to marry again. So he went out into the city and found another woman that was interested in marrying him, so he chose to marry her.She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than the young girl that the man had. And when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife, was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually, it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the gentleman's daughter, was really forced to do all the work in the house. And the daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day.And in fact, they made Cinderella sleep near the fireplace or next to the fireplace, and she ended up being covered with ashes from the fireplace. So they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her. Time went on, and Cinderella's only friends, really, were the animals in the household. All of them, including the dog and cat and mice, and even the rats, were her friends. And so time went on, and they all grew older, and they were in their probably late teens, maybe, when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman.And the stepsisters were not quite so beautiful, partly because they were mean and nasty. So they lived in a kingdom with a king who lived in a palace in the center of the city, and he had a son, and the king wanted his son, the prince, to marry. Well, the prince had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about, and the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom. So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies of the kingdom would be invited, and the prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he'd like to marry. They hoped everybody received an invitation.The stepmother received their invitation and was, of course, very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder. She was excited. The stepmother told the three stepsisters about the ball, and they were excited. So everybody was running around getting all prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes.And finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball. And Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find find something that she herself could wear, but of course, she couldn't find much of anything great. And so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the stepsisters laughed at her and said, you can't go to the ball looking like that. Nobody would want to see."

I had to put children in school. I had to take some shopping to get their take a taxi and tell him where he wanted to go and how to get home.And so how did I deal with it? I studied Japanese every morning, five days a week, until I got so I could do it happened again when I went to Korea. It happened again when I went to Guatemala and Brazil, where they did not speak English. I spoke English in Jamaica and spoke English in Malaysia at that time. But the only time that I've really had what I call a serious communication problem is when I have been transported into a place where people don't speak my language, and I have to communicate it, and I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time.And I find I do it by reading body language, reading facial expressions, a lot of this moving hands to describe what I want. And then as the language picks up on my part, I have, like, the back to do that's. Pretty much my experience with that.Were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared?Yes. Okay, what happened? Tell me the story. Start from the beginning. Okay.I was on a boat, a ship, I should say. The USS president of mine was President Wilson. And we were sailing from, I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my husband and my two youngsters were there. They were probably in third and fourth grade.And we came in we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up. So the captain notified us, there's a busy weather out there, and so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon started, and the two of them met, and our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. My children, one of them was thrown out of her bunk and hit her head on a wash basin.And we strapped them in something, I can't remember exactly, because I was miserable. I was seasick, and I was on the prom deck, and they had storm windows up because the prom you're supposed to be able to see, but they had these bad weather, big thick windows up. And I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair watching the waves come up over me, and then I would hear crashing. And when we would go up real high, the ship would creak and go and then go down.I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life. They had ropes for people. If you had to go to the bathroom or something, you couldn't walk. So you would do this to try and find your way. They had bed sprints pulled off all the beds that were in the Persherance area, trying."

And I actually was doing some interpreting for him at one time or another because I understood what he was same. And that was to me, it was probably the most difficult one that I had to deal with, not because I didn't understand him, but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him. But I also spent some time in mexico, and there's people down there that speak no.I've had to adapt, and I've learned to speak a little bit of spanish, enough to get by things like gustan servesa or donde albano. The important stuff, the beginning was we were planning a trip to cancun, mexico, and we were at the time we'd been discussing this, and we were just standing in line at the movie theater, and it just happened. The couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to mexico, and they started talking about cozumel and cancun, and mainly cozumel, which we had planned to go see, to go to the island of, you know, travel around there a little bit because there's some ruins there. It's a really nice place. Well, the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex marine or something.He was just perfectly built, and they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab. They had gotten near the port. I think they were doing one of the princess cruises or something. So they had come into port and had been spent the day there, and then they had to get back to the ship, so they hired a cab. Well, the cab starts going the other direction, and he kept telling him, no, you're going the wrong way.The port's over here. You need to go back this way. And he wouldn't stop, and he kept saying not to worry. I know, shortcut. It's okay.And he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop, and he and his wife just jumped out of the vehicle as it was moving, and people in the neighborhood that they had jumped out into started screaming about yelling for the federalis because they knew that there was an abduction that was underway. So here we are, maybe a month away, not even a month away from our trip, and thinking about this. We get there to cozumel, and as soon as you get off the ferry, there's all these cab drivers there and wanting to take you around the city or around the island. So this one comes.It was kind of like, hey, pick me type thing in our mind. So we went over to."

So off he went to school with his backpack on and he got halfway there almost when it started to pour rain, and he didn't want to go to school and he didn't want to face his mom, so he had to choose between two bad choices. And he returned home, where he changed clothes. Mom handed him his umbrella, and off he went to school on his second trip that day, but was late.Tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can.There was a man and a woman got married, and the woman had two little girls, young girls by her first marriage, and the man had a little girl by his first marriage. And so they combined their families, and the two stepsisters, I think, were not very nice to the new stepsister, and they were a little older and they ordered her around and they were really mean to her. So she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals, more so than her new stepsisters or siblings in the land that they live. And the girls grew up to become young ladies and with Cinderella virtually becoming the personal servant of her two stepsisters. In the land that they lived, there was a king who had a son who would take his place.But the king was concerned that his son was unmarried and they needed to socialize and decided that they would have a ball in which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a marvelous ball at the Royal Palace. And the invitation came in the mail, and the two stepsisters were very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the young prince to be of interest, but they planned and schemed that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend and was excluded. And when it came time to leave for the ball, cinderella was left behind, but was visited by a fairy prince, who, knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella, said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella and turned her into this beautiful young lady. And and provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin and told her that she was going to go to the ball, which she did, but that she had to leave and be home by midnight."

And the stepmother orders her to do all the household chores, basically anything that she wants to do.Meanwhile, the stepdaughters don't have to do anything. And so Cinderella works and works and works. And that's how she gets her name, Cinder Ella, because she's always dirty from working. And Cinderella lives within eyeshot of the castle and always dreams of going to a ball there. And conveniently, the king tells his son, the prince, that he wants him to find a wife because they're going to need someone else for the throne.And so the prince is like, well, I guess we'll have this grand ball, and whoever I meet there and I fall for is who I'll end up marrying. So Cinderella had been working on this ball gown because they had received a letter that there was going to be this ball. And she was like, oh, my gosh, all my dreams can come true. So she's been working on this ball gown. Last minute, her stepsisters say, no, you can't go, because why would he fall in love with you?You're just this little working girl."

Well, eventually, Cinderella's father also passed away, and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother. Her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her their servant, basically everyone. They were very cruel to her, and she lived a very meager life.But she was friends with all the animals. The animals were the people she got along with, people she could talk to or the creatures that she could talk to. And then one day there was a prince in that country and they were going to hold a ball for him to find his wife as it was time for him to marry.And Cinderella and her stepsisters were very excited to go. However, Cinderella could not go unless she had finished all her chores. Her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish and she said Cinderella could only go if she had finished all her chores first. So by the time it came to go, cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go. But unbeknownst to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores, using fragments of her stepsister's clothes and such that they had cast away because they didn't want it.So Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her. And while the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it, cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress, very happy to go. Then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things that they had cast away. And they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters. And she went out to the yard and was crying.And then fairy Godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight. She made her very beautiful and all that, but she warned her it would only last till midnight. And she turned a pumpkin into a carriage and transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful. And so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince, and I guess it was love at first sight. And they were dancing together, and he very much enjoyed his time with her.And they were dancing outside, and she saw the clock, and she noticed it was almost midnight. So she went racing down the stairs, leaving one of her glass slippers behind, and she went racing off the carriage. And she actually didn't make it quite home when it struck midnight and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin. The carriage turned back into a pumpkin, and everything went back to the way it was, except for one of her glass slippers. And so this prince, after this happened, he was very interested in finding her.He wondered why she had ran away. And so he set out to search for her using the glass slip."

And all I could think of was, what will happen to them if I don't make it home? And my next thought was, It's irrelevant. They will be fine. And then I had, I guess, what would be considered to be a mystic experience from letting go.I have no idea who drove the car.

I was very joyous.And from that point forward, I understood that life was good. It was an astounding, astounding experience. I don't recommend doing it while driving."

No, the house must have been next door because he was going through the picture window in the house next door was sitting Mr.Johnson, and he was just sitting there minding his own business, watching TV, when the ball comes right through the window, knocks over his lamp and surprises him. Probably makes him mad. He stands up and he holds onto the ball, and he looks out the window. And so I'm guessing that he's going to perhaps keep the ball or he's going to go out and talk to Little Sammy and explain to him what he did and ask him how he's going to pay for the window. The the end."

So let's see.You take the bread out of its wrapper and put the two pieces side by side on a plate. Then you find the peanut butter, which I usually keep in the COVID and the jam or jelly, which I usually keep in the refrigerator, and bring those out and put those on the counter next to the bread. Open up the containers and take a knife and spread a thick layer of peanut butter on one piece of bread and a relatively thin layer of jam on the other piece of bread. Then you clap them together with the peanut butter and jelly on the inside, of course. And then you take your knife and you cut the peanut butter sandwich straight down the middle, not diagonally, because that leaves corners that you then have to eat dry.You cut it right down the middle, and there you are."

The Russians had just expelled Alexander Solja Nitson, who you may know is a very famous Russian writer. And we at the embassy were about to bring an American poet to the Soviet Union on an official visit.It seemed to me the wrong thing to do just when the Soviets had expelled their most prominent writer and basically they had stripped him of his citizenship and expelled him from the country and told him he could never come back. And it seemed to me we should remark that in some way the embassy disagreed. So I sent a message to Washington arguing against the visit of the American poet. Washington did not agree with me, and the poet came and the visit went off well enough. As a matter of fact, I was the person in charge of the visit, and it all worked well.But I still felt very badly that the United States government had not taken any recognition whatsoever of the Soviets expelling one of their most prominent writers simply because they did not like what he wrote.Chinese."

She has a pretty profound hearing loss and has for probably at least ten years, but she refuses to have any kind of aid whatsoever. So we have had to deal with this. So when I take her and I'm the one that's responsible for taking her to all of her doctor's appointments and when she's in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth, and so I have to yell at her all the time, and it's so rude and awful to be yelling at her.And even when I explain to the doctors, they still turn and talk to me, and that's frustrating for her. And once I leave, I'm feeling really tense and frustrated because I've been yelling. And our bodies, when we do that, our bodies think we're angry, and so we get really tense. And my mother also is getting some dementia. And so the combination, what I've realized is more to just allow her to talk and not really have a conversation with her anymore.And that's very sad."

And we started it in 2006, and we finished last year. And we chose them geographically, so we knew we could see as many games in the south and in the Midwest, and even though we had traveled extensively internationally. And while that was very, very exciting, this was the most fun that we have ever had.And when we were done, we really felt like we had accomplished something. And we were also very sad that it was finished. But every time they build a new ballpark, we'll be going. And the other thing that we did that was fun with that is that we actually created our Christmas cards, our holiday cards, from photographs that were taken as we were traveling. And we made the sentiment of the card correspond with the trip itself.And the first one, it said, from baseball season to the holiday season, may you always be safe at home. Which is mine. But it was nice. And in addition to seeing the parks, we saw places in the country that we never would have seen. We saw cities we never would have seen.And we interface with people that we never would have communicated with, because they're very different. When you leave the New York area."

And when we have six holes, we carefully take the pot, the root ball out of the pan, out of the plastic container, and we put it very gently in one of the holes. We do this five more times. Then after we pat the root ball or the beneath the pants, her roots and her root ball, I'll call it down so it's even with the rest of the earth.Then we take roots that we have dug up and we fill it in the area where there is no pat that down.

Consequently, you had the choice of either becoming an alcoholic or taking up skiing.

I fell and broke my leg.A simple fracture, not compound. And within a reasonable period of time, the ski patrol came out and picked me up and took me to the hospital, which was Mary Hitchcock, which is now part of the medical school Connect. And I remember it distinctly because I was on a ward with a number of other people with ski injuries, and I was, as I said, young, 18. And the hardest part was not the pain from the injury, which was very mild, and the fact that I knew I had to be on crutches for a protracted period of time and also had to tell my parents what happened, but that I would have to ask a very pretty young nurse for a bedpan. That is the thing I remember most about the."

All four edges will have a slightly raised perimeter.We're going to put red raspberry jelly, open that cap up and spread out just a little layer, like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls. It doesn't have to spill all over the edges and drip down your hand as you're enjoying. But you can have a half peanut butter sandwich if you like. You can fold it over, which was the way a lot of people in my neighborhood did. But I think that's it.That's how we'll do."

And then I would take a separate knife and I would put it into the jam, and then I would put it a little bit onto the jam and spread it.And then I would put the two together, and then I would cut them diagonally into two triangles, and that would be my peanut butter and jelly."

And so sometimes we would have international students come and move into our floors, not only with English, not their first language, but they've had very little English practices. So in those moments, you kind of just have to slow your speaking. I kind of learned when talking specifically with people where English isn't their first language, like, slow my speaking and just enunciating better since I have a mid for Midwestern accent, pure English anyway.So you don't have to focus too much on, I guess, in the dialect in which I speak, but just being articulate. And then also I've had to communicate with people who are nonverbal, too. And so that's different because especially when they can understand you, but they can't speak.

So we went to Brookdale Park, which is where we live, right across the street from Brookdale Park.Now, that was the day that he asked me to get married to marry him. And then I was so shocked.

It's not going to rain. And upon leaving for school with his backpack, it appears that the rain commenced. Then he looks like he's on his way home or way back with his backpack, covering his head and stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down.Arrives home totally salt, facing the mother, and she doesn't look too happy. And he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again, try again, this time with an umbrella back to wherever he was going. Probably still."

And the two daughters were not into having another step, having a stepsister. So the stepmom made Cinderella do all the work.So she would bring the stepsisters tea and she would do their laundry and she would do all the cleaning and she would do all the work, and the stepsisters didn't do anything.Cinderella was very happy and she made friends with all the animals. And one time the cat came and was being mean and she taught him or got him away from her friend, her friends, and told him to leave them alone and be nice. And she was always just doing nice things. And one day she was just looking out her window and she would admire the beautiful castle in the background. And there was a prince that lived at the castle that they wanted to marry off.So one day, the people from the castle came and brought a letter stating that all the girls were going to be invited to go to a ball. And Cinderella heard the stepmom reading the letter and got very excited and so did the stepsisters. So Cinderella went back to her room and she had a dress in her hope chest, and she had a book that showed pictures of other dresses. And so she decided to fix up her dress. So she hung it on her closet and she added a sash.And the birds helped her and the mice helped her, and she made a beautiful dress. And when it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs. And the evil stepsisters didn't want her to go to the ball because she was so beautiful. And they wanted to marry the prince, one of them. So they went after her.And even the stepmom was angry that Cinderella looked so beautiful. So one of the sisters grabbed Cinderella's necklace and broke it. And one of them grabbed the sash and ripped it, and they left and went to the ball because Cinderella couldn't go like that. And she was crying and her fairy godmother showed up. And so she created what is it called?A I can't think of the word, carriage with horses out of a pumpkin. And she used her magic wand and gave Cinderella a beautiful white dress. And Cinderella was getting into the carriage and the fairy godmother said, you have to be home by midnight. Once the clock strikes twelve, everything will return to what it was. So Cinderella went to the ball and was asked to dance with the prince.And they were dancing, and it was really close to midnight and the evil stepsisters were watching and they were so angry. But at midnight, when the clock struck twelve, even though Cinderella was having a wonderful time, she had to take off. And she started running down the stairs and the Prince's people that helped him followed her. And she left one of her glass slippers it."

When her mother passed away, he remarried. Oh, he was a merchant, too. He remarried and she brought the two stepdaughters. One is Brunelda, and I can't remember the name of the other one.So, Giselle, who is Cinderella in this story, she tries her best to make friends and to do everything that her stepmother and her two sisters demand of her, when she always dreams for a better time and a better life. She's very kind, does her work, and is subordinate and kind. Use that word again. So it comes around as she's daydreaming at the castle, she hears tales of a ball, and sure enough, the invitation comes, and all eligible females in the kingdom are to come to the ball and to meet the prince, where he will pick out his wife. So she goes and decides to take her mother's dress and convert it back into her own.The little mice help as well, and they have a wonderful little song that they sing as they do this. Now, once the sisters find out, they are very displeased, so they tear apart her dress to shreds. At this point, they leave for the ball, and she runs to the garden to cry. Her.

I was photographing a mobile crane that was picking up a piece of electrical equipment from concrete slab where high volta its power supplies are that power the neutron accelerator. And I wasn't being careful because I was looking through the camera and I took one too many steps to the left from about 4ft off the ground and was above an area that was gravel and the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact embedded in concrete. So as I took one step too many and tumbled off the left side, just instinctively put up my elbow to stop myself. And the elbow hit.And I was lying there for a bit, a bit. Winded and electricians came over and checked on me and I said, oh, I'm fine. I'll get up. I'll be up in a minute. But then I realized I really couldn't stand up because my leg hurt and the left arm elbow was swollen up in a very swollen and I couldn't not move my lower arm at all.So they asked if they should call an ambulance and I said oh, that's really not necessary and I'll probably be okay in a bit. But the longer I was there, the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg, which turned out to be a very minor problem. But the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I was lying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the 40s that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting shivers. And they did, in fact, call an ambulance who came and when they came over to check on how to get me out of there, because it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up and it wasn't really obvious, they couldn't just pick me up and get me out of there.But first they wanted to check to see if I had had head injuries. So they asked me some questions and one of the questions was where I was. So I told them I was at the Cyclotron building, but by that point it was known as the ASAT Hall, which was the Science and Accelerator Technology Hall, but it had also changed its name to the Mess Hall, which was the Multidisciplinary Science and Accelerator Technology Hall and Science Hall. Of course they didn't know any of that, but the worst question was that I was hoping they weren't going to ask me who the President was. So I said please don't ask me that.So they wrapped some kind of canvas strap around me to keep the arm stabilized and then with one of them on either side they could stand me up."

They walked down the hall into mother's bedroom. It looked so soft. They jumped up onto the bed and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch.Afterwards, they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity.There the baby got into mom's powder, perfumed powder, and he dusted Carl's nose. It tickled Carl's nose, but he liked the smell of the powder. And he was having so much fun with baby. They played dress up.Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can on top of him, just like a little purple hat. Baby had a hat, too. Baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff. They looked at themselves in the mirror and they smiled. This was so much fun.Next, Carl took the baby to the laundry. Uh oh. What do you think is going to happen here? The baby slides down the laundry chute, all the way down, and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby. He gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry.Carl jumps down the stairs, gets the baby on his back again, and runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck.Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room, scattering a newspaper every which way.They walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish.

But she had friends. She was friends with the mice and the horse and the animals that were around her house.And so she talked to them and she would look out her window a lot and look at the kingdom that was far away and just wish that she had a better life than the one that she had. And in the kingdom at that same time, the people that were assisting the prince were planning a ball for him because they said that it was time for him to get married. And so they sent out a letter to everyone in the kingdom inviting them to the ball. And her stepsisters and stepmother were really excited because they thought that they would be one of the ones to marry the prince. And when she heard about it, she got excited too.And so she went into her mother's old trunk and found her mom's dress and her mice friends helped her fix it up, and she put it on and went downstairs, but her stepsisters and evil stepmother ripped it up so she wouldn't be able to go because they were mean. So she ran outside and she was crying. And when she was crying, her fairy godmother comes and asks her why she's crying. And she's like, don't worry, I'm going to take care of it. So she turns the pumpkin into a carriage for her and gives her this nice new dress and turns her my strings into these people to help her get to the ball.And she gives her a pair of glass slippers and tells her, have a good time, but at the stroke of midnight, you need to be back home because everything is going to go back to normal. So she goes to the ball and the prince is excited to meet her and he dances with her, but they're talking and the clock strikes midnight. So she's like, I have to go. I'm sorry. And he tries to get her to stop, but she knew what was about to happen.So she leaves. And as she's leaving, one of her glass slippers slips off her feet and she leaves it on the staircase and she goes back home and everything goes back to normal except for the other glass slipper that she was wearing. So the prince says that he's determined to find her, and he decides that he's going to go to all of the places in the kingdom and have the women try on the glass slipper that she left so that he can find her. And so when her stepmother and stepsisters hear about this, they locked her up, and so she couldn't be one of the people to try on the slipper. And when they came to the house, one of the people that assists the prince have the slipper on a pillow, but the stepmother trips him so that the slipper breaks.But luckily, her mice friends come and give her the key so that she can get out. And she has the other slipper. And so she shows it to the prince and his assistants, and she puts it on her feet, and then they take her away and she lives happily ever after with the prints. Okay.

I was attending a conference in Seattle.I was in an auditorium and I was seated for much of the day, and I noticed that I was having pain in my lower left hip.And I thought to myself, oh, no, I'm having a little outbreak of sciatica and I better pay attention.Gosh, I must be tired, I must be a little stressed. I'll try to get a lot of sleep tonight and hopefully it'll get better. But it was the first time I'd ever been in Seattle and I was really longing to explore. So after that day's conference activities, it was about four in the afternoon, I just started walking the Seattle streets, and a lot of them are on hills, so there was a lot of up and down. And I made my way to the waterfront and there's a very long water walkway along the pier.And I started walking and I noticed that my hip was really sore. And I then kept walking because I really wanted to see everything that there was to see in this new place. And the pain in the hip was worsening to the point where at one point I thought, Gosh, I'm limping. And I ignored it because I have a chiropractor at home who can kind of fix this for me. He kind of pops the si joint back into the place and then I'm in good shape.So I remember consciously saying, I'm going to keep going, I'll deal with this pain later. And what ended up happening is I arrived back home and the pain was bad and I had a long flight back and sitting made it worse. And I got to the chiropractor and he didn't fix it. And for months I had the worst case of sciatica ever. I got really scared that it would never resolve.I remembered ruefully the words, I'll deal with this pain later, and thinking to myself, gosh, now the pain is dealing with me, and let this be a lesson to me, I will never ignore pain again. And I ended up having my first ever cortisone shot in my hip and then it got better. Now, can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating?I would say I have a neighbor, and he has an interesting way of speaking where he takes pauses when he's speaking."

He has a backpack, and his mother is telling him that it's going to rain and he should carry an umbrella. But he, no, no, I don't want to carry an umbrella. So he leaves without it. He tells her goodbye and leaves without the umbrella.And he hasn't gone very far when it actually starts raining. And then it gets harder and harder and harder, and he gets very wet. His feet is splashing in the puddles, and his hair, everything is so wet. So he runs home, and his mother's really unhappy with him. So then he dries off, and this time he goes back out with the umbrella.Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and her mother passed away. And then eventually her father married again. And he didn't realize that the woman he married was so wicked. But then the father passed away, and so Cinderella was left to the wicked stepmother, and she had two ugly daughters.Cinderella was really pretty, so they were really jealous of. So then the prince of this little town became of age, where the father, the king, wanted him to marry. And so he announced, had his man, one of his servants announced that there would be a ball. And all of the young ladies who were eligible to marry the prince were invited to the ball. And Cinderella was so excited about it, and she made herself a lovely dress to wear.So then when the two stepsisters saw how pretty she was, and her dress was so pretty, they tore it all to pieces. So she had nothing to wear to the ball. And her stepmother told her she couldn't go anyway, that she had to go stay in her room. And she was crying and crying, and her fairy godmother showed up and wanted to ask her what was wrong. And she said, well, she wanted to go to the ball, but she didn't have anything to wear.So the fairy godmother just waves her wand and boom. Cinderella just appears in this beautiful dress. And then the fairy gun turns a pumpkin into a beautiful coach, and the dog and the cat into the footmen, and the mice into horses, and away they go in the carriage. Cinderella traveled in the carriage to the fall. And when she entered, she was so beautiful, the prince was just really taken with her, and he danced with her all evening.But the fairy godmother had warned her that she had to be home before the stroke of midnight, because at that point, everything would return the way it was. The coach would be a pumpkin, the footmen would be the dog and the cat, and the horses would be mice, and Cinderella's dress would be gone. But she had given her some lovely glass slippers to wear and apparently she was able to keep the slippers. So then, um, the Prince she, they were dancing. And at 12:00 the she, when she heard the clock strike twelve she ran because she knew she had to get out of there really fast."

They had to open up because there was in addition to the tear in the rotator cuff, which was told as a slight tear, there was also a growth around the size of a nickel. And so, anyway, it had to be open shoulder surgery, and I went with supposedly the best doctor anyway, that night, and it was considered a day surgery that night, the nurse came in, and she went to my arm. Can you feel this?Yes. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? I said yes.Can you feel this? No.So she's like, oh, don't worry about that. She goes, Sometimes it takes 24 hours for the block to wear off. And I had a horrible, horrible, horrible night of pain. I was, like, out of my mind in pain. And I kept ringing the buzer all night, and then, like, around, oh, I don't know, three, four in the morning, the nurse came in, and I think she had me up to here with my pain.And she's like, all right, I'm giving you morphine. And the next thing I know, she came in, and she was, like, in my thigh, and that was the morphine. And it was around 06:00, the surgeon came in, and he was doing his rounds for the morning, and he said, I heard you had a really bad night, and open surgery is very difficult. Bridget I guess from the time of the MRI, it went from a partial tear to a complete tear. And the growth that was a nickel was the size of a golf ball.And he also discovered that the bicep was torn while he was in there, and he grafted bone from my collarbone. And so basically, he was, like, all over from collarbone all the way down to the bicep and lots of nerves in there, whatever. So it was rough, so I understand that. So I said, okay. And then he said, So, for the pain, he said, I can give you another block.Now, I had one for the surgery, so now it's like, say, six ish in the morning, and I was supposed to be day surgery. He said, I can give you another block, and it will take you off. He said, But I have to tell you that sometimes with the second block, people lose feeling in their fingers and it doesn't ever resolve itself. Now, I still have the morphine in my system, but yet I remember this, and I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.Because I was remembering what the nurse said, that 24 hours. And it was kind of like it did concern me the night before. So I was like, I don't know. I don't know. And he said, Well, Bridget, said, I've got to see everybody else on the floor.So you think about it, and by the time I come back here, you have to have a decision.But I may never get he goes, well, it's 50 50. It doesn't happen to somebody, but your chances increase. So boom, off. He's gone. And I was, like, fighting to stay awake, because I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school, at high school, and I wanted to tell him, bruce, do not let him give me the second block, which eventually Bruce appeared.I told him that. Told him everything I just told you. I'm like, I don't want the block. Meanwhile, I was out of my mind, in pain. There was a wonderful male nurse.He kept me there till, like, 04:00 that afternoon. So I surpassed the day surgery timeline. And finally they discharged. Oh, PS. Madison.That was July of 2010. And then I went home, and then the next two weeks were just horrific. I had no feeling. He tried to tell me I had carpal tunnel preexisting."

And then eventually her father passed away, and they began to call her Cinderella because they treated her so poorly, and she had to do all the chores and stuff. So she was covered in cinder.And I don't know if that's a Disney movie, but I know that's the original.So as she's growing up, she's forced to do all these chores, and she's mistreated, and she's basically made for all of them. And she kind of looks at the castle and she dreams of kind of going and meeting the prince and living a better life. So one day, the castle decides that the prince needs to marry and needs a princess. So they decide to have a ball for him to meet someone to marry, and her household gets an invitation. So Cinderella gets excited and learns to sew and sews a really pretty dress and a really pretty necklace, and she gets all her chores done and gets ready to go to the ball.And then her stepsisters decide, well, they don't want her to go. They don't like her. They mistreat her. So they tear up her dress and ruin everything. So now she can't go to the ball.And they dress up, and they go without her. And while she is crying, her fairy godmother appears. And all throughout this sure, they're singing a bunch of random songs. I don't know.So she makes Cinderella a really pretty dress with glass slippers. And the whole while Cinderella was growing up without any friends, she befriended her household animals, like the mice and the horses and whatnot. So the fairy godmother turns them all into a really nice carriage. The carriage is made of a pumpkin, and the mice are the drivers, and the horse become like really beautiful white horses, and they take her in her dress to the ball. But she has to be back by midnight or everything will turn back to normal.It'll be her bad dress, and the carrot will turn back into a pumpkin. So she goes to the ball, and people don't recognize her, and she dances with the prince. And then all of a sudden, she realizes the clock is about to strike midnight, so she runs away, and she loses a glass slipper while she's running away. And so, yeah, she gets halfway back, from what I remember, and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin, and she turns back into her ripped dress. But the one glass slipper she still has stays the same, and she's really happy.She has this great night. And then the prince comes, like, sending all of his men and guards looking for Cinderella by seeing the glass slipper fits. So Cinderella's stepsisters end up locking her away. And then her Mite's friends bring her a key to get her out of there.And the prince's servant comes with the glass slipper to put it on Cinderella. And as he's running a scene that there's like, another girl who hasn't tried to slip around in the city or in the town, the stepmother trips him and the glass slipper breaks and everyone's all sad because Mazel never finds a girl. And then Cinderella's like, well, I have the other glass slipper. And if it."

But what happened instead is that she was put in a position of servitude with her aunts and cousins, and she actually became kind of an indentured servant. So she would serve them and clean. And she didn't even live in the house. She lived with the barn animals, who became her friends.And she would daydream in the barn about visiting a castle in the kingdom that was far away, but she could see it in the valley in the distance, but she imagined it would be a long, long distance to ever be able to visit the castle. But one day, an invitation came from the prince that he was having a ball, and he invited Cinderella's aunt and sisters, and she assumed that she could go. And her barnyard friends revealed a secret chest to her, which she opened to a book of magic. And from that book of magic, she was able to conjure a dress and pearls to wear to this gown, to this event, and she arrived to accompany her kin. And they absolutely rejected the possibility of her going.They ripped the necklace off her neck, and she was in despair. So from this treasure chest and this book of magic, a fairy godmother appeared, a wise, powerful older woman. And she granted Cinderella's wish of attending the ball, but to do so, she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance. So Cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and new hair and makeup. So she was virtually unrecognizable.And as a final touch, her fairy godmother created a pumpkin coach and a fleet of horses to take her to the."

Anyway, she's a young girl and her dad remarries, and the stepmom has two daughters of her own.Then when the stepdad died, or the dad dies, cinderella is left on her own with her stepmom and her two stepsisters. And she's kind of made to be made to be made.MMM. She she next picture is like her playing with a cat.

Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you? It could be happy or sad from any time.It it yes.I purchased my house, and I live towards the end of a dead end. And I was so excited because I thought, given the road that I live on, it will be safe to let my animals go outside. And it actually was the spring. It was in early April, quite a long time ago. And I came home and I found my kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home.It was unspeakable, and it was devastating because I came to this place with this vision of safety for my animals. So it was very upsetting.I went through grief, and then I did some prayers, and time passed, and it was coming up on summer solstice. So it was in June, and I started imagining because the kitty I lost was a girl, she was my only female.And I thought, gosh, my household really needs a female kitty. And if a cat would just happen to cross my path, I would consider adopting a female. And if that cat just happened to be a tortoise shell, that would be even better. So I went to a party hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country, and she was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born on her land. And there was one left, and she was just a little tortoise shell female kitty.So I took that as a sign that she was meant to be mine. Yeah. Another series of pictures. When you're ready, tell me this story.Okay.The janitor at school was taking a break in the lounge, which happens to be near the soccer field. Some kids were playing on the field outside, practicing, and one of them kicked a ball and it went through the window into the lounge and knocked over a lamp next to where the janitor was sitting.He was shocked and not in injured, but he did get up and look out the window to see what had happened."

        "transcript": "I had a significant auto accident when I was 33, and I was in a company car selling pharmaceuticals, dropping my children off on the east side of Indianapolis when I was struck in the side by car coming the other direction. And my children were okay. But I have possibly no memory of it, because after a time, you don't know what you remember versus what's been told. But I had some pretty severe injuries. I had a severe concussion.I had a kidney laceration, broken ribs, and four pelvic fractures. So that let's see. I was taken to a hospital on the east side. My almost husband picked up my children and took them to my mother. I was in the hospital for two weeks, and when I was released, I was on crutches with no weight bearing for most of the summer.We used a wheelchair, and I just kind of managed to heal, and let's see. So I had no complications after that. And then I think it was three months almost exactly that I was able to walk again, and we were married. So that's the biggest thing that's happened to me. Wow.All right, for your next prompt, I'm going to ask, can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating, such as my husband, if you wish. Is that all right to you? Yes, of course. No one else? So an experience or just general all the time?I'm going to leave that up to you. Okay.Well, obviously, living with someone with aphasia, especially moderate, severe, is difficult, and you do learn different ways to communicate, and then sometimes you just don't. One story that I can think of, he was able to drive but not use a phone, which he still doesn't really use a phone. And we were supposed to meet at a hotel on the north side of Indianapolis for some sort of a meeting. I can't remember what it was. And he was coming separately.And I got there, and time went on and went on. What I learned from this, he was driving up and down Meridian Street. He knew it was a hotel. He knew it was somewhere on Meridian Street, but he didn't know which hotel, and he had no way to call me, and I had no way to call him. And what I learned from that experience and I can't say I'm 100% perfect on it even today, but his auditory comprehension is horrible, and if I want to be sure he understands, it needs to be written down, because he understands what he sees.But like most people with aphasia, they are the best fakers in the world, but they don't really mean to be. They just want to have it be the way it used to be. And so they'll nod their head, yeah, they understand. And they don't understand. I've asked him for something for my garage, and he'll come in with something instead of saying so, I know he didn't understand.He'll go ahead and go out and come back in with something totally not related."

And so I hired on as a social worker. And during the first week, the welfare department hired many social workers.And I met another woman who was hired at the same time I was. And we became friends and got an apartment together. And she introduced me to a man who had gone to the same school as she had gone to in Michigan. And that gentleman and I fell in love and remarried. It was a very pleasant marriage.It was a church wedding. And the sister that I had gone to visit in Seattle was my maid of honor. And we stayed in Washington. My husband was teaching at Port Orchard, which was just across the bay from Seattle. And we lived there for the first year until we moved back to Seattle.And that was how I met and married my husband.The young boy appears to be practicing soccer because he is kicking a soccer ball which I assume accidentally goes into a window and breaks the window. There's a gentleman sitting in the living room next to the window and the ball comes through the broken window and knocks over the lamp. And the man picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window to see if he can tell where the soccer ball came from.All right, a little boy is leaving the house and his mother tries to get him to take an umbrella with him, but he is so happy not to have the umbrella. And when he opens the door, it is not raining. And so he talks her out of giving him the umbrella. But when he gets out and is walking away from the house, it begins to rain. So he turns around, runs back to the house and comes back in the house soaking wet and dripping.His mother is very angry because he didn't take the umbrella with him. And she frowns at him. But then he decides it's all right to take the umbrella and out he goes with the umbrella to prevent the rain from making him wet.

And that's a type of I think it was called French polio because the men were from France. And I was on a vacation out over in San Diego with friends, and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet, and I was stumbling, I was having a hard time walking. And I knew something was wrong.And I really kind of thought it was fate. I thought maybe I had a brain tumor or something really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned on going to Universal Studios. And I wasn't in pain, but I was just having a hard time walking. Yeah, beret starts at your fingers and toes and then it works in so I can remember this going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair.So by that evening, by the time we all got back to our hotel, I was really quite concerned. I did sleep, and the next morning they took me to Scripps Medical Center in the San Diego area. And the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Bray affects it's an autoimmune disease. And he asked me if I had had the flu recently, and I had. And so the antibodies that attack your flu, attack your own system, and this was what was happening.So first they wanted to admit me to the hospital, and I said, no way, I was going back to Phoenix. They asked me to shuffle a deck of cards I couldn't do that. And snap my fingers. I couldn't do that. So I got back in the car with my friends and my daughter was with us.And he said, if you have trouble breathing because it can go all the way and it affects your muscle, affects your muscles to find the nearest hospital. But I got back home and it took me about six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery. For about six weeks. I couldn't drive a car, I could feed myself, but I couldn't cut anything up. I could shower, but I couldn't turn on the shower.I had no strength of my hands or my feet, I couldn't stand on my toes, any of that kind of thing. So then I started wherever it goes, from the outside to the inside of your body, and then it stops, and your body stops, starts healing again. Then it was a slow recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit. But I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister.She was living with us at the time, and I just felt like an old lady. And this was over 20 years ago, so I was in my forty s and I was just holding on to the grocery cart for dear life because my balance was so poor and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over. But I recovered. I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands. I can occasionally have a hand trimmer, but I feel like I'm 99% better."

I had sold more property, closed more closings than ever had, and started feeling short of breath. So I went to the doctor, like in June, my doctor was in class taking some extra classes for something.And so I saw another doctor, and he gave me blood pressure medication, and I continued to work work. Finally, in October, my doctor came back, and I went back to her with a list of symptoms, and she decided I needed a stress test because I'd never had one, and this was a nuclear stress test. So I took my stress test, and the doctor turned his back and started talking to his assistant. And I thought, uhoh and he turned and looked at me and said, you have flunked your stress test, and I want you back in one of my rooms immediately. I think you have considerable cardiovascular problems.So anyway, he wanted me to go into the hospital the next day for a heart calf. And I told him I was sorry, I couldn't do that. I had an appointment, real estate appointment that was very important to me and to the lady that I was working with. And he said, what about Thursday? And I said, I can't do it Thursday.And his glasses are going further down on his nose. He said, how about Friday? And I said, that'll work. I can do it Friday. So anyway, I go for my heart cath on Friday.And he didn't even let me sit up afterwards. He said, you have blockages, and I want you to have surgery today. And so I had triple bypass surgery that afternoon, and so that was pretty traumatic because my family never thought of me as ever being sick. They worried a lot about their father, but they didn't worry about mom, because I was constantly going and doing and everything. So anyway, I had the surgery.My recovery was good. I had a good attitude. I never once got depressed because I felt so grateful that my problems had been found and I could go on.I went through cardiac rehab at central Baptist, and I did everything they told me to do. And I was in rehab for probably about six months and have recovered. However, two years later, I did find that two of my bypasses were blocked. And it's a genetic thing. I'd done everything I was told to do.Diet. I'd been doing the diet thing for years, and so I had to have a stent. And then a year later, I had to have another stent. So since then, I have done well, it's been two years now since I had a stent, and I'm back to normal as far as I'm concerned. And so I'm just hoping that everything will go well and I don't have to have any more stance.But it was."

        "transcript": "Meowsted the same thing in Pokemon. It didn't end well for him either. So the wolf. Hi, Jesse. The wolf goes up to Red Riding Hood and he says, what you got there, kid?Because he doesn't have many social graces because he's a wolf. He was raised in a wolf pack, and so he doesn't know how creepy this is, but he also kind of wants to eat her, so he's a little bit aware of how creepy who this is. And Red Riding Hood's like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers. And the wolf says, show me what you got in your basket. And he rifles through a basket because obviously he can take it.He's a wolf, and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own because that's smart. And I'm not sure what happens. I guess he just he talks to her. That's what it is. He talks to her and he says, what you're doing with this basket, kid?And because she is six years old and not very smart, she says, I'm going to my grandma's with it. She's sick. She is. Up in that hill, you take a left at the lightning struck tree and a right at the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then you just keep going straight over the bridge.And there's my grandma's cottage. She gives them really explicit instructions to how to get to her grandma's cottage. She's six years old and dumb. And the wolf drops the basket and he says, oh, that sounds great. Bye.I'm never going to see you again. Don't look for me at your grandma's place. I'm definitely not going there. And he bounds off in the direction of the lightning struck tree in the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And Little Red Riding Hood says, that was completely ordinary.I see nothing suspicious about this. And she picks up all the stuff and puts it back in the basket and starts going on to Grandma's. And obviously before she gets here, the wolf gets to Grandma's cottage and he listens at the door and he hears Grandma singing along to Led Zeppelin and says, grandma clearly can't hear me because she's singing along to that heavy metal music. So he opens the door and he knocks Grandma out and ties her up and put her in the closet where she just sits there kind of sniffling and humming Led Zeppelin to herself. And he turns down her crazy tunes and gets into her to make he has to take her clothes first.He's a weird wolf. Social graces not his forte. He gets Grandma down to her underwear, puts on Grandma's nighty, and, like, her cap and stuff. He doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too. But he puts on her nightcap, and then he ties her up and stuffs her in a closet to sniffle and humbled Zeppelin.And he gets into her bed, and he pulls the covers up right here and waits for Little Red Riding Hood. And Little Red Riding Hood comes up to grandma's door eventually, probably like half an hour later, because she's six. And she knocks on the door, and the wolf says, oh, come in, dearie. And Little Red Riding Hood says, that's weird. My grandma never calls me deary, but I trust this situation implicitly.And so she comes in, she looks over to the bed, and her first response is not, there's a wolf in my grandma's bed. Her first response is, hi, Grandma. I'm six, and I'm stupid. And she goes up to the bed, and her grandma says, oh, her grandma. The wolf says, oh, what did you bring me, dearie?And she says, well, I brought you stuff from my mom because I heard you were sick from dancing naked in the rain. You need to not do that so often, but you should also tell me what to do better in the rain naked. And the wolf says, okay. He doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain. He's got a fur coat on at all times, but he's willing to improvise."

        "transcript": "Cinderella lived with her father and presumably her mother died. I think that's what happened in the original story. I don't know what Disney said, but that's not important because what is important is that when she was a little girl, little cheerful girl, very nice, her father remarried to this not very nice woman who had two not very nice daughters who had big noses and angry eyes. And basically, I'm pretty sure her father died also. I don't remember that from the movie.I figure it must have been too tragic for kids, but it's a grandmother's thing. They kill everybody's parents off. So Cinderella, at this point, is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters and no parental oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the servant, basically the slave of the ceremony. She doesn't get paid.And her only friends are the cute little furry animals like mice and dogs and horses. There's a cat named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure aptly named. There's a cat named Lucifer who belongs to the step family, who is always terrorizing her mice friends. And so she has to protect all, you know, good buddies. They sing songs together.And then one day, the king in the castle up in the distance, very far away, cinderella looks longingly out the window because she wants something she can't have because that is the fundamental facet of human existence. The King says to his advisor, I want my son to get married because he's getting on in years and he wants a grandkid. Pretty much is his only motivation for that, which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your heir of parent to get married to me. But the heart wants what it wants. And so the king decides to throw this enormous ball to which every single eligible maiden in the kingdom will be invited.And by eligible maiden, I mean probably over the age of 13 and not already married. The trogle is probably negotiable. So the step family and Cinderella get the invitation and they're all psyched because this is great. One of them could marry the prince. Not Cinderella, obviously, because she's hideous and not worth it.But one of the stepdaughters could. And so, leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited. And Cinderella, her mice and bird buddies, make her a dress because they want her to go to the ball also because they're just nice, they're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this and she gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball. And she puts on the dress and she goes downstairs to meet her step family at the door for them to get into the carriage to go off to the ball.And they say to themselves, Nah. And they rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable so she can't go to the ball, because they're mean. And at this point, Cinderella's kind of crying to herself, and I'm inclined to be, like, crying to herself because she's a baby. But also I would probably cry because that was a nice dress. And if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry.So she's sitting there crying, and all of a sudden her fairy godmother comes. Why she has a fairy godmother nobody's really sure for. Presumably because she's so pure of heart. But a fairy godmother comes and says, bibbity boppity boo. And everything is wonderful.And the pumpkin turns into a carriage. The dogs turn into horses."

        "transcript": "Yeah, because she's so pretty, but she won't stay that way and they're very sad and oh, this also seems to come out of left field inappropriately. Enter the prince who also comes upon the Seven Dwarfs cottage just suspicious.And so taken with how beautiful Snow White is even though she's dead, he kisses her. And that doesn't seem like the type of husband that I would want to have. But he's a prince and I guess her prince came. So she wakes up and they're in love and the dwarves are happy. And we all learn the more of the story is to just maim people instead of kill them and to not accept food from strangers, see?And they live happily ever after. Now I want you to tell me as much of the story of Little Red Riding Hood as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as pictures you just looked at. Okay? Once upon a time there was a girl and because she won everywhere in her red cape, everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.Okay? So little Red Riding Hood lives at her house with her parents. And one day her mother says to her little Red Riding Hood I'm going to prepare a basket for you to take to your grandmother's house. And I even think that her mother gives her advice about the path to take to grandmother's house to take the most direct path and not to lolly gag because that's when trouble happens. And so Little Red Riding Hood actually, I think in my story little Red Riding Hood actually wants to take the most right path but there's some reason why she can't.And I think it has something to do with a signpost being oh, I know why. Because the wolf spies Little Red Riding Hood coming with a bag skit to her grandmother's house. And he says, oh, little girl, where are you going? And she says, I'm going to my grandmother's house. You shouldn't talk to strangers that's bad.Don't tell them where you're going. And so he jumps ahead of her in the path on the way to her grandmother's house and switches the sign so as to delay her arriving at her grandmother's house. So the wolf goes to grandmother's house and he oh, doesn't knock on the door. That's a different story. He gets in the grandmother's house and he gobbles her up whole.That's important. And meanwhile Little Red Riding Hood does not know that this happened. And the wolf, who I think his end objective is to eat Little Red Riding Hood which you would think he'd be saved by eating grandma, but he's not, puts on grandmother's clothes and gets into her bed, which is some creep. It's a fairy tale.And when Little Red Riding Hood arrives, he lures her in by acting like grandmother. And then Little Red Riding Hood notices Keen. Little little Red Riding Hood keenly notices that her grandmother was acting really weird. And she says, oh, Grandma, what big hands you have. And he says, oh, the better to tickle."

And they make her do all the work around the house, cleaning and all. They sit around and eat Bomb bonds and get fat.And one day, a letter comes to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing a slouch party for his son, who's going to be looking for her bride. And the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince would want to marry one of her three daughters. And Cinderella hears about it, and the stepmother know she's going to have to help to make the dresses for her daughters.And she stay at the house while they go to this fancy party, and they all get all excited and get ready and go. And while Cinderella's at home cleaning up her very godmother comes and tells her that she's going to help her go to the mall. And she waves her magic wand and the pumpkin turns into a stagecoach and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown and she's whisked away to this lavish party. And she's also given these glass slippers to wear.And she, of course, she comes into this party and nobody recognizes her, including her stepmother and the stepsisters. And so she's this beautiful, mysterious who comes into this party. And of course, the prince is immediately attracted to her and not to these stepsisters.

And in the middle of this dance, she remembers her very godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken.And so she realizes it's almost midnight and she runs from the palace. And in doing so, she ends up dropping one of her shoes. And she gets home just in time. And, you know, she when the when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home, she is home and her tattered clothes again, and she's cleaning and she asks them how the party went. And they're not happy because the prince didn't notice them, of course.Um, but then the Prince wants to find this mysterious girl, and the only way that he has to find her is the glass flipper that he."

        "transcript": "Went to a lot of physical therapy two times a week and had them put me through a series of exercises, kept visiting Dr. Grossfeld for a checkup and followed her instructions to the letter about the recovery. Most of it involved physical therapy.My wife and I are members of St. Michael's Episcopal Church. And last year, Sharon took a course called EFM, or Education for Ministry. I had determined that it's a four year course, and I had determined that she enjoyed it so much I was going to take the course this year as a first year student. Meanwhile, the two people who were the mentors, administrative mentor and class mentor last year decided not to return.They were both from Berea. So Sharon agreed to be a mentor, and I was drafted to be the administrative mentor who takes care of the paperwork and sets schedules and things like that. I have to know nothing theologically to be an administrative mentor. I just have to be able to do paperwork. We have six members in our class, and one is a lady who is in a wheelchair who has in the past attempted suicide.She is a neat lady, but she has a lot of difficulty communicating. And one of the things that I've learned to do in talking with her is to be very patient while waiting for an answer. And sometimes I have to ask the question two or three times to get the answer. But I'm learning to have more patience, and it appears to be working. The most important event that comes to mind right now is the fact that I got married in October of seven.I had known the lady named Sharon for 30 something years. In fact, I trained her.I met Sharon in the late 1960s. I trained her first husband as an equipment salesman for Central School Supply Company, and we had been friends ever since. And upon the occasion of a divorce in 1991 in Henderson, Kentucky, sharon and I had remained friends, and I called her, came to Lexington to visit, and lo and behold, we began a relationship which lasted for some 17 years. 16 years, 17. And it worked out very well because my children had known her forever and they all loved her.She is a great person. And in December of six for Christmas, I gave her an engagement ring which surprised her and astounded me. But we proceeded to be engaged for about ten months. And on October the 28th, 2007, what I thought was going to be a small, intimate wedding at St. Michael's Church turned into a grand gala affair with a couple hundred people and a reception that was real well done.A lot of friends from Louisville came, a lot of Sharon's friends came, and we just had a grand time. Two of our very favorite people who are Episcopal priests, jay Pierce and Joyce Bovie, married us."

So he decides, I think, that he's going to keep the ball.I hope he gives it back to the boy. And I'm sure the boy's parents insurance, home insurance will pay for the window. And the little boy, I'm sure, is very sorry that happened.Okay. The mother is trying to give the little boy an umbrella. And he says, no, he doesn't need an umbrella. He's a big boy.

And I think he's saying, you were right, mom. I was wrong.And so he gets the umbrella and goes on happily to school.Okay, it looks like somebody is in floodwaters. And it looks like she's probably been in her car, maybe, and tried to go over a road that had too much water and she's being washed away. And it looks like maybe a fireman or somebody who is trying to rescue her is also risking his life trying to rescue her. I'm sure he does get her rescued. But, boy, she's in a really dangerous place.Cinderella was a beautiful little girl and she had three stepsisters, and the stepsisters were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful and so they didn't treat her very well. She had to do all the scrubbing and the cleaning while the stepsisters went about their way and had the pretty clothes and all that. There was going to be a ball at the palace and it was for the prince to try to find a bride. And so the stepsisters were very excited about the ball, and of course, they weren't going to let Cinderella go. And so they got all dressed up and they went to the ball.And Cinderella is just very upset that she couldn't go. She's just kind of wistfully looking out the window at the palace, and suddenly her very godmother appears and tells her that she wants her to go to the ball. And she dresses her in a beautiful dress and has a carriage waiting for her outside, drawn by horses. And I believe it was a pumpkin. Maybe it turned into a pumpkin.Anyway, so Cinderella goes to the ball and she gets to dance with the prince. And he just really is. He just really loves her. I think she's really beautiful."

And so the fairy godmother waved her magic wand and the mice and a pumpkin that were sitting there turned into a coach, the footman, the driver, and the horses. So they were able to have a coach, but Cinderella still didn't have a dress.So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand, and Cinderella got a beautiful dress, just magically appeared on her. It was a very beautiful dress, and her hair was all done up nice. So she was able to get into the coach. And a fairy godmother told her, only one thing you need to do. You need to be home before the stroke of midnight.Because after the stroke of midnight, the chariot I'm looking for, my word, the the carriage that she went in after midnight would go, everything would change back to what it was.

So on the way home, she got home, and it happened that she was there.And she was so happy that she had had the chance. Well, she was showing the mice her one glass slipper that she still had, and the mice were excited about that. And the Prince went to the right hand man and the King and said, I want to find this girl. So the right hand man and another guy went to all the houses in the village looking for the person that could wear that glass slipper that they found. And they tried it on all the women.And they got to Cinderella's house, and the stepsisters tried the shoe on, but their feet were huge, and they couldn't get it on.

        "transcript": "Well, that would be dull for you. So I will tell you a different story.I have asthma that is very well controlled, but I had a host of different kinds of less controlled moments growing up with asthma before there were the quality of, you know, maintenance treatments that there are now for asthma.And my asthma is most frequently triggered by allergy issues. And in particular, I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle, because they are non shedding dogs. And I am allergic to all cats very badly, and I'm also allergic to trees and various molds grasses. Yada, yada, yada. But cats are probably the worst culprit for me.So when I was in high school, probably freshman or sophomore in high school, I think my sisters were out of the house at that point. So it was just me living with my mom and dad. And one summer, we took a vacation down no, it was in the fall. It was in the fall, and we went down for, like, an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why, did not really think about the fact that they had two dogs and a cat, I believe, shedding dogs and a cat.So we were going to stay two nights with them. So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner. And I could tell I was starting to feel it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother, having been my mother, always could look across the room and when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma tap, she would look at me and say, it's time for you to go, isn't it? So we kind of reached that point, but we were supposed to stay there. Well, they put the dog in another room.People try that kind of thing, which, of course, never works because the animal lives there. And I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there, but we did. Or maybe I said, oh, I'll be okay, I'll be okay. I took medicine and whatnot, but by the middle of the night, I was beyond okay, and it was to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe. And there were no inhalers back in those days, it was liquid medicine that A, was less effective, and B, took a long time to activate.Plus, if you stay in the space where the stimulus is, your medicine is only going to last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night, I could bear it no longer, and my loving, loving father said, let's go to the car and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night.So then the next day, I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were. But we spent enough time in the house. I just couldn't get past it. I was so affected and I am not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did stay in that house that night, but it just continued get worse.And by that next evening we had to go to the Er and back. In those days I suppose they do something. Well, there were no now. You would go and you would get a breathing treatment."

And these children have traumatic brain damage, or they're severely disabled, where they barely can function. They are in wheelchairs.All their ADLs are done for them. They don't communicate at all verbally. And so basically the only way that you can communicate with them a lot is by their affect, by the way maybe their eyes, how their eyes are turning in or out, or if they're looking at you the way that you touch them, maybe just communicating, some of them. Well, I have several classes. There's another class that's MoMD, which is a little more advanced.And so in that class, we communicate by sign language. Like this would be please, or something like this, like the doctor or the nurse. So sometimes we do sign language with those kids and we can communicate with them that way. Okay? In the beginning of the story, it looks like there is this little girl, probably between an eight and ten year old little girl, and somehow I don't know how she got into a raging river, but it looks really cold and the fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her.And he has all his equipment on. And basically he has to go out into this raging river and he's grabbing onto some kind of tree limb, a branch or something for his support. And then he's got some kind of a build or something to pull her in or to help her, to help her in. But he's also out there in danger in his life too.Okay? There's this little boy, probably 1012 years old, and he's out playing soccer, just having a really fun time. And the ball goes through possibly, maybe the neighbor's window, or maybe it's his own front window. And the ball knocks over a lamp, so actually it breaks the window glass and also a lamp. And the man was sitting in a chair, and then he picks up the ball and he looks out the window, and that's all in those pictures.So I don't know what the end of the story is. I don't know what the little boy does. I love this one because this is typical, typical of kids and mothers. Okay? So the little boy is getting ready to go to school.He has a backpack on, and his mom says, I think it's going to rain today. We take the umbrella. And the little boy goes, no, I'm not going to take it. It's not going to rain. Trust me, okay?Kids think they're smarter than the parents, but they're not. And the mom says, you need the umbrella. But he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside and it starts to ring.Ha. And so the little boy comes back home and he's soaking wet, and he comes back in, and his mother is a little upset with them because in her mind, she says, I told you so. Why don't you listen to me? And he's sopping wet. And so he takes the umbrella and he goes to school.And I hope you learned a lesson to always listen to your mom."

And whoever's foot that glass slipper fits will be his bride.

So that's why sports were kind of like something I wasn't really into.So I stopped playing soccer because I stopped enjoying it. And I joined the swim team because I was like, I need to do something that'll help my body not be as lazy as I want it to be. I need to do something active that'll help my body. And I heard that swimming was really good for you. And ever since I was a kid, I loved going to a lake or to a beach and swimming.It was, like, my favorite thing to do.

And Jerry was this amazing cat where he had a stub for a tail, and he actually, ironically, know how to goatee. It was the weirdest thing. Yeah, it was so weird. And so Jerry would sit in the yard, just sit, like, lie down for 20, 30, 40 minutes, and a bird would fly by, and it would just immediately be able to jump several feet in the air and catch the bird on the fly.That's how it hunted. And it was the most amazing thing I've seen. It was unbelievable.It was a pretty cool, pretty cool cat."

If you can make the try under the uprights, you just basically kick straight into the uprights. Now, when the ball goes out of bounds, you form two lines and you have your hooker throw the ball overhead into the line s and you pick up, generally, the lightest tallest person on the team. Generally, the two props pick up by the knees and by the butt, the lightest tallest person on the team, so they can get the most height possible, as fast as possible and throw the ball down to the scrum half, who can throw it out to the rest of the back line. Generally, the line can be three people to six people.No, sorry, three people to five people."

Her mother had died a long time ago, and her father had decided, it's time that you had a mother, and you need some brothers and sisters. So he went out into the town, and he found a woman who he thought he could like, and he married her and brought her and her two daughters into the house and told Cinderella, here you go. Here's your family. You now have a new mother, and you have new sisters.Go along with it. Well, what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet. And they treated Cinderella horribly. They made her do all the cooking. They made her do all the cleaning while he was off sailing around the world.That's why he wasn't around. That's why he didn't know what was going on. So the Cinderella is having to do all the housework, and she's taking care of everything, and the evil stepsisters are just bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do. So Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were there in the farm area. And she would talk to them, and they would talk to her because they had that special communication.Then one day, from where Cinderella was at when she was talking with the animals, she could see, like, the whole town that she lived in. And off in the distance, she could see the castle where the prince lived. And she always thought, wow, it would be so neat if I could live in a castle. That would just be amazing. But I'm Cinderella, and I won't ever happen, because I have to make sure that I take care of my stepmother and my evil stepsisters.Meanwhile, over in the castle, the advisor to the prince is starting to get worried because the prince is still single, and people in the town are starting to talk, so he's a little bit worried about it. So he says, okay, here's what we'll do. We will put this whole proclamation thing out, and we will get all the single ladies to come to the castle, and we'll let the prince pick one with all the women. There's got to be one that he's going to like. So we'll bring them all here.So they send out a message to everybody in the village in the town. They say, okay, we're having this big birthday party for the prince. Bring your single daughters over here, because he's going to be picking a wife. And the evil stepmother gets this message, and she says, well, this is great. I'm going to put my daughters, because then we can get out of this oval and move back into a big castle, and we'll be all rich and famous.And Cinderella thinks, wow, that'd be kind of cool. Maybe I could get into this, because I'm pretty good at sewing and everything, and I've actually made a dress, so I should be able to go, too, because it says all the single daughters. So she puts her dress on, and she walks out into the living room, and the stepsisters see it and decide, wow, she looks a lot better than we do, so we can't let that happen. So they rip up her dress, and then they take her and they, like, shove her in a closet and lock her away. And then they take off and go, and Cinderella is really sad, and she's like, oh, no, this is really a bummer.And while she's upset, she finds this book. And while flipping through the book, she sees a reference to a fairy godmother. So she reads the reference, and all of a sudden, fairy godmother shows up. And she says, well, Cinderella, I'm here to help you out, because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things. I'm going to grant you some wishes, and we're going to get you to this ball.And so Cinderella says, okay, well, how do we make this happen? She said, well, first we need a way to get you there. So she takes Cinderella's little animal friends, and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her to the ball. She turns the mice into coachmen, and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into a big carriage. So she does all of this, and then she."

So he tried to climb up the tree and get the cat, but he wasn't able to reach the cat either, and the dog continued to bark at the base of the tree. The next thing that happened was the little girl's mother called the fire department to see if they could come and help.So the firefighters came with their ladder, and they're heading to the tree as well.

The father passed away, and Cinderella was left to live with her stepmother and evil stepsisters.They didn't treat Cinderella very well, always asking her to do things around the house, whereas the stepsisters were very spoiled and got to do whatever they wanted. One day, the prince in the village sent out a declaration that he was looking for a princess, and he was going to have a ball, and he invited all of the young women in the village to come to the ball. The stepsisters were very excited to go to this, and Cinderella overheard and really wanted to go to the ball as."

Well, the family dog decided that he was going to eat that cake, so he got himself a big mouthful and got his paws in to it too, and ran and hid underneath the sofa so that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom. The little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined and his mom was trying to hit his dog. In the meantime, the guests started showing up at the door carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on.You make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking two pieces of bread. On one side, you spread the peanut butter, and on the other side you spread the jelly, and then you put the two together.Oh, my. In about 19 84, 80, it's been a long time. I had my four wisdom teeth extracted as a precaution. I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so that I wouldn't get an infection, because when I was seven years old, I had rheumatic fever. They always told me, well, your immune system isn't going to be near as strong, so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery, including oral surgery.So I did that, and that evening, early evening, my throat swelled up. Don't know if it was from the penicillin or what, but I ended up back at the dentist's office, and they ended up having to take some epinephrine. They gave me shots of epinephrine, I think two of them, and they also took a syringe and sprayed it on my throat to help the swelling go down. Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with something called they called it then angio neurotic edema. But it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called hereditary angioedema.The difference between angioedema and hereditary angioedema is that angioedema, which is like the hives, can be treated with antihistamines. Hereditary angioedema cannot.Until recently, the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine.During that time, shortly after I was diagnosed, my throat again swelled up just out of the clear blue. I went to Urgent Care. In Urgent care. They started an IV on me. And the doctor I don't know if she was a doctor or a PA.Anyway, she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline in the IV. And anybody who's ever had adrenaline knows that's the wrong place to give it. It goes intermuscular. It's not to be intervenous because it takes within just a few seconds, it takes your heart rate from a normal 72 up to like 150 or 180 beats a minute."

So he found a woman with two daughters and they decided to marry. So now little Cinderella, his daughter, has two stepsisters. They grow up in the house to together, but they are very, very different children.The two stepsisters are very vain, very selfish, and force Cinderella to do all the work in the house instead of them helping out. And the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen. So Cinderella, because she works so hard, has no friends except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house, and they befriend her. She sees the prince's castle from afar and often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle as a princess. Meanwhile, in that castle, there's a prince.And the prince's father is very frustrated because his son is just not interested in meeting women and marrying. And the king is definitely ready for his son to get married. So he decides to host a ball and bring all the beautiful ladies of the area to the ball. And so he sends out invitations. And when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations, the girls are very, very excited because now they can see themselves married to the prince.And Cinderella also shares in this dream. However, Cinderella's stepmother says, oh, no, you can't go to the ball because you have too many chores to do. And forces Cinderella to do even more chores because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters and does not want that competition for her daughters. So they get all ready to go to the ball, and Cinderella goes through all her chores, but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also, so they help her with the chores. But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball because she doesn't have dress.And so in a puff of magic, her fairy godmother comes to her and says, I will help you, Cinderella. So she makes a beautiful dress up here with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball that is made out of a pumpkin. And the mice, she waves her magic wand and makes into fine horses that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball. So in the meantime, just before Cinderella takes off for the ball, though, she says, remember, the spell is only good until midnight. And after midnight, the coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will turn back into your little friends again.So make sure you're out of there by midnight. So Cinderella goes to the ball and nobody recognizes her because she's dressed beautifully, she's clean, she smells good, and the prince is so taken with her, he cannot believe his luck that he has found this beautiful young woman and falls in love with her instantly. Love at first sight. But as they're taking one of their last dances, she hears the gong from the clock tower and knows that it is midnight and she knows she has to leave quickly. But he doesn't want her to leave.And he holds her back, and she says, no, I must go. And she runs out of his arms, runs down the stairs, trips just a little bit before she gets into her coat."

One of the things that I have been doing for the last 1012 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis at Riley Children's Hospital. And it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So I very much have learned from that, a not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult, that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them.And that is a lesson, because it's easy to make that assumption, as I'm sure you know. So I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact, from their facial expressions, from their motions that may be jerky, that may be just excitement, that that is a response to the story. And while I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understanding and capacity with this story, I can sense their emotional and response to whatever it is that they do understand in the story. And it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection even when there is no speech coming back on their end. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life?It could be happy or sad or from any time from you or a kid or more recently. I'm going to mute myself now, and you can begin this time. I will tell you about the birth of my first child. So it was 22 years ago on March 14. I was due on March 9.I'd had the good fortune of having a fairly benign, easy pregnancy. And nothing had happened. Nothing had happened. We were on to day five after the due date, and that day was singing in a very unusual thing, singing with a choir that I was part of a small chamber group, I should say, that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding.So I went to the wedding and we sang. And I did kind of notice that I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but whatever.The wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial. And I called my sister who lived I was in Sacramento at the time.She was in Southern California, and she is five years older than me and three kids older than me. So she already has three. So we're talking on the phone."

I was hospitalized for, like, a week.They did, like, an exploratory surgery to repair the internal bleeding and my spleen. My mom came to visit me every day, and I hated getting my stitches out.Remember being on medication? I didn't like the hospital food.Got lots of gifts. It's very tired. When I went back to school, I couldn't take a whole day of school. I got a private tutor to catch me up from the school I missed. Must been out more than a week.Um, bye.Did I hold time? Doing okay? All right.It okay. I'm ready. Good. I have a girlfriend that's German. And we were cleaning out the TAC room, and I have a horse blanket in the TAC room.And I asked her to get a big garbage bag so I could put the horse blanket in it for the winter and kind of put it up for the winter. And she as I put it up on the shelf, she couldn't understand how the horse blanket was going to fit on the shelf where I keep the garbage bags. So she came back with garbage bags, and she had cleared off the shelf where I keep the garbage bags. But horse blanket is as big as this table, and the shelf I keep the garbage bags on is maybe six inches high. So she still brought me the garbage bags, and she gave me a very puzzled look like she was going to do with them.So I hold the bag out. Let me get the blanket for you. And I pulled up the blanket, and I put it in the garbage bag. And she said, how's this going to fit on the shelf? I said I wasn't going to put it on the shelf, just going to bag it up for the winter.So when I was in third grade, I flipped over my girlfriend's house. Her mom and dad were out for the night, and she had two older sisters, and Bonita was the oldest sister. I don't know what happened to Alyssa. Maybe she wasn't there. But Jennifer and I and Bonita were home alone in the house, and we were playing hide and seek.Bonita could not have been that much older than us. Maybe she was in junior high. We were in elementary school, and Bonita hid in the closet in the guest room, and the closet door got stuck, and she couldn't get out of the closet door. And we started to panic, and she started to panic, and she started to cry and bang on the door. And we couldn't get a hold of her mom at dinner.This is before cell phones. The mom didn't tell us what restaurant she went to. She'd have a cell phone? We ended up calling, like, fire department, the police department. We were really scared.We weren't going to get Bonita out. She had no air in there. But the fire department came and they had to take the hinges off the door to get Bonita out of the closet. And she was just sobbing. We were all scared.She wasn't getting out of the closet.There was a flash flood did somewhere down south, and a little girl got swept away. One of the very muscular emergency workers crawled out on a limb."

        "transcript": "All right, so when I was about five, I had an allergic reaction, and my skin would turn purple. So I was bedridden, and I missed my kindergarten starting date. And, um, eventually my allergic reaction was traced to my tonsils and my tonsils, so they they took away my tonsils. And I remember being fed ice cream, all the ice cream you can eat after the operation. And once that was taken away, I was back to normal.One of the things that have stuck in my mind, as I say, I can't remember exactly, but I think I was about four, and this thing went on for about three months. So one of the things that I remember was that I was not supposed to move very much. I was supposed to be in bed and not moving very much. And whenever I was left alone, I remember that I would jump on the bed as a sign of rebellion against this order, this doctor's order that I was to stay, just lie as still as I could, which was impossible to expect a four year old to follow that. So that's one of the things I remember.I also remember the doctor coming into, because I was put in my parents bedroom, which was larger than my own during the day. And just one of the images I have was this doctor would come and he would take the lamp shade of the side table lamp and put it on my head as a hat. And he did that like, three or four times. And then I didn't like it that much, but he kept doing it. He thought it was a funny joke.So it's one of the things that have stuck with me. So that was not a stroke, it wasn't a mental thing, but it was an allergic reaction to my tonsils. So the next thing I'd like to ask is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? That's a very broad range of what we could mean by that.But if you can mall died of Alzheimer's. Okay, in that case, please tell me kind of what the issues or problems were and what you did to try to communicate with that person. Okay.I, of course, stood sort of second row to the problem. My father in law and my wife at the time were the most affected by it. And I remember trying to find things that she would be able to have a conversation about, which, as the illness progressed, it became more and more difficult all the time. But I was the one trying she was a music teacher, so I was trying to talk about music and kinds of music she liked. And then at some point, she would give some responses that were totally coming off the wall."

        "transcript": "Okay, so there was a girl named Cinderella, and she got two new stepsisters and a stepmom, and they were really mean to her. The stepsisters were very full of themselves in vain, and they didn't like her, and neither did the stepmom. So she did all the work around the house and she played with the animals and she slept and did everything. And then she dreamed of going to the palace and having a better life. And one day the stepmom got an invitation to a ball at the castle.And the stepmom and the stepsisters were very excited and they began to get ready. And then Cinderella wanted to go as well, but they didn't want her to go. And so she didn't have the best dress. So then she put it on and then they ruined it and pulled her necklace off and broke it and everything. And then they all left to go to the ball.And Cinderella was at home and she started crying. And then her very Godmother appeared and told her that she could go until midnight. And then she had a carriage made out of a pumpkin, horses, and a nice dress, and her hair was done and everything. And so she went to the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person and they wanted to know who it was. And she danced with the prince, but then she realized it was almost midnight and so all of her stuff would turn back to normal.And so she went back outside and was running off and her glass slipper fell off. And then when the prince was trying to follow her, but he couldn't catch up to her, but he found the glass slipper. And so she got back home. Her stepsister and their mom came back home and they were all excited and they didn't know that she had went. And then the next day, the prince was going around trying to find someone that fit whose foot fit the glass slipper.And finally she tried it on and it fit. And they went off and got married and lived happily ever after. Excellent. Okay, and then last for this first test, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Okay?So first you would need to wash your hands. And then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread. You take the pie. There's usually a twist pie on the bread. They take it off and open the pack.And if it's a brand new pack, you probably want to throw away the first piece. The end piece, you probably don't want to use that. But you grab two pieces of bread and you can put them on a plate or a napkin separately. And then you go and grab a knife and peanut butter and the jelly. And so first you're going to choose either the peanut butter or the jelly, but let's just go with the peanut butter.So you'll twist the top off of the peanut butter and stick the knife into it and get some peanut butter on the knife. And then you'll use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread. And then when you finish spreading the peanut butter, you'll go and wash the knife off and then you'll open your jar of jelly either. It's probably going to be a twisted top as well. So you're going to twist it and use the knife and bread the jelly with the knife on the other piece of bread."

She apparently was adopted it and their mother and the cat, who is equally sharing in the dislike that one acquires of the mother and the two spoiled daughters. But the scene opens with Mama and the two daughters castigating Cinderella, treating her like an adopted child, which is, of course, what apparently she is. And then the scene shifts, and there the king and his staff working out the details of a party that they go to have, and they send an invitation, which comes to the mother of this family. And she and her daughter two daughters, are wonderfully happy to receive it and proceed to buy nice dresses and get all prepared for it.Meanwhile, Cinderella is not asked to go, and there's a sad scene of her looking out the window the palace.And then there is justice in the world. And out of nowhere appears the fairy godmother, who's a nice, well turned lady with a big smile. But more important, she makes possible all manner of good things, including a coach and four horses and a beautiful dress and glass slippers.So Cinderella dons eve and whisks away to the all, and there she has a wonderful time. But the godmother tells her, you must be gone. You must leave before midnight, or the carriage, which I made out of a pumpkin, is going to become a pumpkin again. Well, as luck would have it, cinderella is having a wonderful dance with a young prince, who's tall, handsome, reminds me of myself 50 years ago, maybe 60. And it gets very near midnight, and at a certain point, Cinderella rushes out it before the coach turns to a pumpkin."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a widower who had a young daughter, and he decided to remarry. The woman that he chose had two daughters herself. And then they were a family. But the mother, the stepmother to the little girl was not kind to the little girl, whose name was Cinderella. And in fact, her her two daughters were equally unkind.They were very cruel. They insisted that Cinderella do their laundry and bring them tea whenever they wanted. One day, Cinderella was looking out the window at the palace at the palace far, far away in the distance, the castle where the prince lived. And one day, the family received a letter in the mail, an invitation, because the king had become very concerned that he had not found a suitable wife for his son. And so he decided to give a ball, a big dance, and he would invite all the young women in the kingdom.And so he sent out his invitations, and one arrived at the home of the widower and the stepmother and the three daughters. And the two older daughters were excited about this. We will go to the ball. Maybe the prince will choose one of us. And Cinderella was looking over their shoulder, and she was also reading the invitation.And she thought, well, I could go to that, too. And so she went up to her room and she looked in her trunk. She looked through all of her things, and she found a dress, a pink and white dress that she thought probably would work. And now the animals in this household were very sympathetic to Cinderella. And the two little mice were watching, and they were cheering her on.So Cinderella put on her lovely pink and white gown and she went downstairs and to show the stepmother and the two stepsisters. When they saw her, they were irate and angry. And they said, you cannot go to the ball with us. You're just a Cinderella. You're just a little chamber maid.And with that, they began to rip off the ribbons and the other fancy attire. And so Cinderella had to go back up to her room and the stepmother and the stepsisters not only that, they locked her in her room so that there was no possibility of her leaving to go with them when they went off to the ball. And Cinderella sat in her room, weeping, suddenly sparkling stardust fell upon the room, and there appeared the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said, why are you weeping, Cinderella? It's because my evil stepsisters and my stepmother will not allow me to go to the ball.And I wanted so much to go, and they tore apart my dress, and now I have nothing to wear. Oh, yes, you do, said the fairy godmother. And with that, she waved her magic wand and stardust fell all over the room. And suddenly Cinderella was clothed in the most beautiful white gown and her hair was done up in a very fancy hairstyle with a hairband, and she was absolutely beautiful. And the little mice cheered and said how wonderful she looked.And Cinderella said, but I have no way to get to the ball. Oh, yes, you do, said the fairy god."

        "transcript": "Cinderella was a young girl who was an orphan, and this family brought her into their home to raise her when she was about seven or eight years old, and they provided a place for her to stay. But in this family were man and his wife and two daughters. And the two daughters were jealous of Cinderella right from the very beginning. And they gave her a hard time bossed her over, made her do all the dirty work around the house and such. And the Cinderella slept in the attic upstairs, but she had the view out her window of the castle where the royal family lived, and thought it would be nice if someday she could go and visit in that cabin.So anyway, years went by and the family had received an invitation from the castle to a dance. So they were all excited about it. And on the night of the dance, while the two daughters, cinderella had gone in and gotten one of the dresses and put it on, pretending like she was going to go to the dance, too. But the two daughters, when they saw her with that dress, they made her take it off and put her own shabby clothes back on. And then they all left for the castle and the dance.Meanwhile, Cinderella goes out in the garden in the backyard, and sitting on the bench back there, what was all of a sudden appeared her fairy godmother. And she went over. Cinderella went over to her and talked to her and expressed her desire to the godmother, her desire to attend the ball at the castle. So the godmother said, well, we can do that. I'm going to furnish you with a coach and horses to pull it, and the coach itself will be in the form of a pumpkin.Now, the only thing is, you've got to be out of that castle and back here by 12:00, and I'm going to see that you have a real nice dress and glass slippers and everything. So Cinderella went up, put on the dress and the slippers, and then went down, went outside, and there was the coach, which was made out of a pumpkin and I believe, four horses to pull the coach. She got in the coach, and the driver of the coach took her up to the castle and she got out and went in. And actually, the time she was up into late teens, she was a very pretty girl, much prettier than neither one of those mean sisters. So anyway, when the prince who lived in the castle saw her, he was really taken with."

So Bird came, and all I remember is sort of that she basically was aware that there was a ball being held at the castle and all the young ladies were invited to come to the ball. And Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated. She basically had to do all the work that the other sisters didn't want to do, so she was always been getting jobs to do and never was able to do them to the liking of the evil stepmother.So she kept just getting more and more jobs to do and and so she was never able the so the the day of the the day of the ball was approaching, and she never had any time to work to to basically to make her dress or to go to the ball with. So the yeah. Meanwhile, the other two stepsisters were were getting ready for the ball, and basically the were getting their dresses put together, and so they were all prepared to go to the ball. And then on the day of, I believe Cinderella still wasn't ready, and so the birds and the mice and all the other animals tried to help her put together something, and they were stealing. I remember they were stealing, like, the needles and buttons and things from the stepmother to put the dress together, and she was discovered.That was discovered. And the stepmother basically gave her more jobs to do and made it so she couldn't go to the ball. Somewhere in the story there's, fairy godmother comes into the picture. Yeah. So this is her still doing all of these jobs, and it yeah.So she's all sad and unhappy that she won't be able to go to the ball, and then her fairy godmother appears and waves a lot of magic wands and things like this, and basically something gets turned. Pumpkin gets turned into a carriage, and I think the mice turn into horse. Either carriage drivers or the footmen are the drivers for the carriage. And so then she creates a nice gown to wear, and off she goes to the ball. But she has to be back by midnight because the spell ends at midnight.And so the sisters, of course, they see Cinderella there, and they're all jealous and they're wondering how she and the stepmother are all wondering how she got there.

So the only time I had to go to the hospital was when I was seven.I was playing skip or something on the playground at elementary school and hopscotch and I tripped. I'll never forget it. There was a twig that went from one section of a ground to another. My foot hit it just right and I plowed right into the vent that was along the brick of the school. Do you know what I'm talking about?Man, my head hit that and it sliced open my forehead right here. Oh, my goodness gracious. And you know what? It didn't even hurt at all because I guess it was so sharp. But the blood started coming down.So I was rushed to the hospital and they had to sew me up. And believe it or not, about a week afterwards I was kind of playing with it and I accidentally opened it back up again. So then they took me back to the emergency room and they did a butterfly thing. And after that I was fine. That's the only time I've been really to the hospital.Can't say it was terribly traumatic, but there you go. Have you had any experience with someone or people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that kind of broad. Any issues communicating? I have two people.Okay. So what I'd like is you can choose one or both, but just kind of tell me what the issues are or were and kind of what you do about those issues or did. Okay. Well, the first person that comes right off the bat is my nephew. He's autistic.He's nonverbal autistic, so of course he'd be the first person I think of. I don't get to see him too often. He's always on his iPad. But he's grinning a lot. He grins a lot.He's 21 years old, and what I do is I smile at him and I try to hug him. Sometimes he lets me, sometimes not. And I'll just say, It's so good to see you, Nicholas. The only thing you can do is just really smile and keep him at ease because he can get very upset. So I can't say I do a whole lot for him because I don't know how to deal with autistic children.But it sure is good to see him when I see him. Did I answer your question? Okay, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened in your life? Happy or sad? Something from childhood or more recently, just something important that happened that you could tell me a short story about?Yes, I can. Well, wonderful. Okay. Approximately 22 years ago, my oldest brother Eddie collapsed in a stairwell. Turned out he had total renal failure.One kidney is at 0%. The other one was at 10%. He was on dialysis for two years was having troubles with it. We decided to get tested to see if we can donate a kidney. And I already knew that I was going to be a perfect match.I actually knew that. And sure enough, I was. In fact, not only was it a perfect match, the body has six blood antigens. And Eddie and I both are missing two. Either one or two?One. And it's in the same location. It's weird. So the doctor said that not only do we match better than twins, the kidneys should last at least 20."

Select the type of bread that you best like to eat. Because the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a dining experience.You should select the type of peanut butter again that you most like. I like crunchy peanut butter, and therefore I would have crunchy, preferably extra crunchy peanut butter. To make the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you would want to take a knife and apply about one quarter inch of peanut butter evenly over an entire slice of bread. Finally, select the type of jelly or jam that you best prefer. I would prefer probably strawberry preserves with big chunks of strawberry in them.On the other side of the bread, I would apply again another quarter inch or so of strawberry jam. Put it on really nice and thick. Put those two pieces of bread together. It should be cut in half and it should be eaten immediately. Immediately with a cold glass of milk.In this picture, there is a series of unfortunate events. It looks like it all started with a cat that climbed up into the tree, maybe after a bird. The cat is sitting actually almost looks like it's sleeping very comfortably in the branch. Little girl is standing and jumping underneath the branch trying to get the cat to jump down, but is unable to do so. She's unhappy.That was followed by her father climbing up into the tree using a ladder to help get the cat down. Unfortunately, the ladder fell down while he was still up in the tree, and so he's stuck in the tree now. Meanwhile, the dog is furiously barking at the base of the tree because dad is stuck up in the tree and the cat is as well. Someone has called the fire department finally to bring another ladder to help get both dad and the cat out of the tree. And the firemen are quickly running over to the tree to help everyone out.The end. Okay, the injury I'm going to tell about was breaking my left collarbone. I was approximately 22 years old. I just graduated from college, was in Peace Corps and was in Thailand. In Peace Corps in Thailand, you drive on the opposite side of the road, kind of as they do in Great Britain, and was driving a motorcycle down the road.It was a small country road and was going to pass a dump truck going relatively slowly. Just as I got beside the dump truck, the dump truck made an abrupt right turn directly in front of me. I ran into this gas tank. I went flying off my motorcycle into the ditch by the side of the roll road, and the truck stopped immediately before actually running over the motorcycle. At that point, I knew something was wrong.It was not very comfortable, but not horrible pain. I was in the ditch. The truck driver came over and asked me if I was hurt and I said I was not. Thought something might be wrong, but wasn't sure. In the meantime, a farmer who is in the field nearby came over.He prayed over my shoulder, which was scratched."

She was brought there because she was going to be their helper and clean their house and make them dinner, and would live there for the rest of her life. The stepsisters were very mean to Cinderella. They actually picked at her, made fun of her, and as she grew up, she always wondered, as she looked out the window, what it would be like to live in the palace. Soon as she got older, she saw that there was an invitation to the grand ball to meet the prince.How exciting this would be to finally go and meet the prince and possibly one day be able to live in the palace.The stepsisters were all getting ready to go as well, and the evil stepmother was making sure that they were going to be greeted by the prince and have an invitation of their very own to meet him in person. Oh, Cinderella thought, I wonder how I would get to the ball. So she opened up a chest, and there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were going to help sew the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace. Soon the stepsisters found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince as well, and they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress. Oh, no, Cinderella thought.Now what shall I do? How will I ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil stepsisters? Then, out of nowhere, a beautiful good witch showed up and she granted Cinderella a wish. The wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city, that nothing would ever compare. She would also grant her a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince.The only exception was that she would have to be back by midnight, or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin. Oh, this is so wonderful, Cinderella said. Yes, I have to go. It is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball. Then I shall grant you your wish, said the good witch.And there she was, standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine. Crystals and diamonds everywhere, and the beautiful horse carriage. And off she went to the palace. There, everyone stood in line to meet the prince. Finally, Cinderella got her turn, and there she was.Oh, no, she said. It's almost twelve. I cannot finish my dance with the prince. So she hurriedly ran down the stairs. And as she ran down the stairs, one of her glass slippers fell off.The prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered, who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown? Minutes later, Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags and no riches anymore were on her. She went back to scrubbing the floors, mopping, wondering about her wish to become a princess one day."

        "transcript": "I'll never agree to that. And they had a whole group of doctors around the bed. He said, why wouldn't you? I said, Because it's a foreign object. And that's what happened before.And I said, I will clean it every day the rest of my life before I'll let that marbles be put in there, them contaminating that area. And the doctor put his arm around my shoulder. He said, I'm proud of you. He said, you said exactly what I wanted you to do. So we didn't have it done.And he lived eight years that he wouldn't have had. The doctor said, for the care that I gave him. During that time, I started to change the tube. I couldn't get it in, and it scared me to death. So I called a surgeon, which was a cousin of his, to tell him that I couldn't get the tube back in.He said, Go over to the hospital and let them do it. Well, I took all of the things that was sterilized and told the doctor at the hospital what to do, and he couldn't do it. So he goes up to the fifth floor to get a surgeon, and he comes down, little old fasty man with a mustache, black mustache. And he reaches over to get pair of gloves off the wall. I says, no, you can't use those.Those are not sterilized. He said, It wouldn't hurt him if I picked up something off of the floor and put it in his back. I said, Let me tell you right now, he's laying there because of your negligence. You're not about to put something in his back. And he looked back at me, and the two nurses that stand there, they looked at me, and he left out the room, and he told the man to go get him some sterilized scissors.He turned around, looked at me, sterilized.He took those scissors, and he was going into his back and was going to stretch that area to try to get that open so he could get the tube in. I says, no, you're not either. You call his doctor right now. He's not about to be done that way. And so he left the room and he came back with a wheelchair.And he said, I'm going to take him up for X ray. The doctor wants you to come in on Monday. This was on a Friday and to have a scan done. And so he wasn't very happy. The nurses says, what's wrong with you?And I told them about what had happened, and they said, Aren't you afraid? I said, I'm scared to death, but he needs help. So they took him upstairs, and the doctor had us go over there. We never saw that doctor again. Don't know what happened to him.I think he lost his job. I don't know. I'm sorry about that. But I wasn't about to let my husband go through another ordeal of their negligence. And so anyway, it was about a month that after that I developed hepatitis.And he had to stay and take care of me. I was put to bed. He had to wait on me. I couldn't even lift a cup. And if I had been clean, having to take care of his back, there was no way that I could.I wasn't able to. And so God's plan is better than ours is. He healed his back is the way I feel that the doctor said would never be there the rest of his life. Healed his back so he could take care of me. And then as soon as I went back to work, they told me I'd never work again.I went back to work because they said he would be better if I was working. I went back to work. He developed cancer of a different kind in the other lung. And he did the radiation treatment on that. And a month from the day that he finished the radiation, he died."

I told her and she says, I think she married, Dave. I says, what's that?So in the said I was well, at least expressed an interest in me. So I thought, well, maybe I ought to look into this. Well, I'll go over, see the girls anyway, so I went over and saw the girls, to their delight, to my delight especially. And I was leaving. I heard the hardest commotion and this Diane Stanford come running out and introduced herself.And I said, yes, ma'am, Mrs. Stanford. Yes, ma'am. No, I'm not married. I'm single.I said, City director says you're married. She had a hard time convincing me of that. Anyway, things progressed and we had a very short courtship. And the funniest part was she would come up to I was living about 35 miles north of Ashland in a small community on a lake. And she came up she would go to church with me on Sundays and then after Mass, we would get together with four or five of the couples and the priests and go to the local joint and have dinner.Got to be kind of a habit. And she would drive up every Sunday and then we would go back to the lake and read the paper, whatever. And finally I proposed. I mean, she encouraged me. And so we decided it was sort of early June.Now, we hadn't known each other more than five weeks and it was sort of early June and it was kind of a rainy day. And I said, well, let's take a ride and go to the place nice and neat. Well, we came down, we ended up at Maysville. We went all over the place and nothing was open. And we stopped at a little town across the road from Maysville called Aberdeen at a truck stop.Had something to eat, went back up to the cabin, up to the lake and it was getting sort of starting getting dark. And she had to drive back to Ashland at 35 to 40 miles on a Hawaiian road. And I says, you better get going. And she says, not till I call my mother. And I says, what are you going to do?That I'm going to tell her we're engaged? And I says, you are. She says yes. So she called her mother. And she hands me the phone.I says, what are you going to talk to her? Well, her dad comes on the phone and I introduce myself. And I said, I'm supposed to speak to your pat pan. He's yelling and both of them are hardly hearing. And I could hear, he's on the phone, he's on the phone.She ran over to the phone, picked it up. And she says, well, did he? And I says, yeah, I sure did. We both had a big was the that was the start of a great marriage that's still going on. What we have is a story of a boy kicking a soccer ball, having a good time.Number picture number two, that ball gets errantly kicked and that goes through a picture window, lands in the lap of the man of the house who's reading the newspaper.

Cinderella is back into her chore woman's dress. Her Buffant hairdo is all straggly again and she walks home about half the way because she did get out of the side of the prince. And she walks home and she gets home and says, well, that was a pretty good night. Probably won't hear from that guy again because I can kind of tell.Maybe he was not all there either.So the prince, he gets up the next morning. He says, hey. He says, I think I could go for that. So. And all he has is a glass slipper.So he tells all of his people. He says, Listen, we got to find that girl. And so they go out and they begin to look, and they check all around, and they come up to Cinderella's house and the two stepdaughters are there. And the two stepdaughters, they come out and they look and they say, oh, I know I can get that shoe on. And if I can get that shoe on bamo.I'm going to be the princess. So the prince is standing around and he says well, he says, you don't really look like the one I was dancing with last night. Or last week. But here, try on the shoe. Let's see if it works.And the first one tries it on and it's too big. Her foot won't fit into a size ten army shoe. And the second one comes over and she tries it, and she can't get in it either. And the prince says, hey, is there any other girls around the house here? And they say, no, there isn't anybody.And Cinderella, on the other hand, is looking from the kitchen where she's scrubbing the floors, and she hears this. And the prince says, Wait a minute. I just saw somebody in the kitchen. They said, oh, that's our stepdaughter or stepsister. You don't even want to see her.She's too ugly. And so he goes in and she's pretty straggled. Her hair is all aflitter. She's in a char woman's dress. And he says, Well, I don't know.She looks a little familiar. If she had a good LaFonte hairdo and a white dress, I'd probably recognize her. So he tries on the slipper on the cinderella and it fits like a glove. And he says, were you there the other night? She says, yes, it was me.I was dancing with you. He says. Really? He says okay. Well, how come you're not in a nice outfit?And she says, well, my two stepsisters and my stepmother, they keep me tied up here in the kitchen. And he says what? She says, yeah, they keep me tied up in the kitchen. I can't get out. I don't get to do anything.He says, well, we'll take care of them. And so he says, come on, let's go. Let's get out of this hellhole. And so he picks her up, he takes her over to his carriage and they go back to the castle. The king is ecstatic because he's found he knows that the prince likes the girl.Probably friends, but that's all right. And the prince and the girl, they get married. It's a storybook wedding. And they live happily ever after. The end.There was a flood, a flash flood that came through."

        "transcript": "So my biggest illness happened just before I went to kindergarten, and it was around an infection in my tonsils, and the symptom was that I would get these purple rashes.So ultimately the cure was to have a tonsil operation and have my tonsils removed. The process was a very long in fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose the cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time, they were trying to figure out what was wrong. And then I remember my family changing the physician, and then this physician who saw me for the first time says, we need to take out his tonsils right away. And so I was bedridden, and I had to stay in bed.But the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to show that I could do it and contradict the doctor's orders. So that was my most traumatic bed ridden experience other than flu, two or three day flu or stomach virus. That was my major illness. And I was late going to kindergarten. So I always remember that I spent some time trying to catch up with the rules, and everything was the way it had been for about a month, and I could not join them until a month later.So I was playing catch up in kindergarten.Our next prompt. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And this is kind of an open topic any type of difficulty communicating fits, but what we'd like is for you to tell us what sort of problems there were with communication and what you did about it.So for about a year, I was teacher. I was teaching Spanish. I'm very fluent in Spanish. And I was teaching Spanish at Salvador Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island. And one of the students in my class would completely refuse to do anything.He would not answer questions, he would not respond, would not participate. He was excluding himself from the classroom every class. So eventually I said, okay, I have a problem here. I tried different things to making him the silent participant in plays or skits that we would put on in class. Even that met with very partial cooperation from him.So I called him to a meeting, and then he told me a very long story of how his parents had spent so much money tutoring him or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through high school, in math, in English, everything. And he had this aversion towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish the reason why he was not participating. He could have been just making it up, but I think he was at least he made the effort of coming to the meeting to explain to me why he would not participate. And I took that as a positive move on his part."

And then we'll put the book away and ask you to tell it in your own words.Some of these pages are they're a little sticky? I think it's the shape. Yeah.So there once was a young girl named Cinderella. She lived alone with her father, one day married an evil stepmother, although she didn't know she was evil at the time. And along with the mother came two very nasty stepsisters. Now, the stepmothers and stepsisters treated Cinderella very poorly. They made her do all the cleaning, up all the washing.Even though the family was fairly well off and could afford to hire servants, cinderella's father was most often away. So that left her alone to the mercy of her evil stepmother and stepsisters. Now, Cinderella grew close to the animals that her family owned. The horses, the mice, not technically owned by her family, but living in the house and the birds of the forest, and could get them to help her with the chores every now and then. One day, Cinderella found out that her family was going to the Prince's ball.She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it. She took her time and made her own dress to go with her family, because her stepmother and stepsisters would not allow her to be provided one. And upon learning that she had planned to do this, her stepmother and her stepsisters tore the dress from her, tore into it, and made it unserviceable to go to the ball. Now, after her stepsisters and stepmother had left to go to the ball, a fairy godmother came to Cinderella and told her that she could help her get to the ball on time and charm the handsome prince. And to do this, she transformed a pumpkin into a carriage, and the mice, the horses and the birds into appropriate helpers for Cinderella.She also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers. She, however, told Cinderella that Cinderella had to be back by midnight or else the magic would wear off. Cinderella went to the ball, had a fabulous time. She was noticed by everyone upon entering, including the Prince. And the prince asked her to dance, choosing to dance with her over the two stepsisters, neither of whom recognized her.Somehow she enjoyed her dance with the Prince so much that she lost track of time. And just before it hit eleven, she noticed, or just before it hit twelve, she noticed that the time was about to be up. So she ran from him without an explanation. He chased after her down the steps of the palace. She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running.The prince stopped and picked it up, knowing that he could never catch up to her, as it were. She managed to just escape the castle before the magic wore off, leaving her back to looking like plain old Cinderella. She went back to her house thinking that would be the end of."

So I stopped at the church, picked her up, and she went with us. And we got to the hospital, which is like another world from where I live. And when I finally was allowed to see him, he was on a gurney and and he was propped up and very his eyes were open, but there was no response. It was very vacant.And I did all the things you think, like squeeze my hand, blah, blah, blah, blah. He did nothing. There was no sign that he was there, except that his eyes were open. And that was the beginning of a very long recovery. But he was paralyzed and couldn't speak and really just wasn't present.And we had this go on for several days in the ICU until he started improving. And he was in the hospital there two weeks, then in a rehab hospital for four weeks. And then he came home and he was able to walk at that point, not well, but he could walk and went to outpatient therapy for a year and a half until the day they said, we don't think he can return to his job.And they said, given that you have private disability insurance, if he does a job trial, it might show that he can do a lesser job, and that might not benefit you both financially.And that day was the end of therapy. There was no easing into it. It was done. Goodbye. That's it.At which point I picked up the phone, knowing that while he was physically probably where he was going to be, knowing he had so much more to do with speech. And I called, started calling around, and I'm a nurse, I know who to call. And I was amazed to find out that Indianapolis has no university based speech programs at that time, anyway. And eventually I called different hospitals at the med center, and they told me that all the speech was in Bloomington, which I should have known, because my sister graduated from that program back when it was not rehab, it was all school therapy. And I called down there and talked to the secretary that answered, and that was the beginning of our relationship with the Bloomington Speech Clinic.And we traveled for twelve years. We drove to Bloomington every week, and he gained a lot from it, and we made a lot of wonderful friends between the therapist and the other clients we met. And that led to me eventually starting a program here in Indianapolis. And it's the only thing up here that's a support group, and it's modeled after the program in Bloomington. Here's another series of pictures.When you're ready, please tell me this story. All right, we have a young man who's out playing soccer, practicing, and that soccer ball gets away from him and smashes through a window. And sitting next to the window is a gentleman who is possibly the father, but not necessarily. And a lamp. And that soccer ball comes right through the window, breaks the window and knocks over the."

And a car ran into me from the side at a fairly good rate of speed. And I don't remember remember much of the accident, except that I heard the story so many times my children when the car came to a stop, I don't remember anything about the other driver or where they were. But I can almost visualize the moment that maybe I came to and my oldest son was able he was in the front seat. He was able to open the door and run for help.And I remember telling him this. I do remember I remember saying, tell Richard I need call Richard and tell him I need it. And so fortunately, there was a home very close, and he ran and used the phone. Of course they called 911. So my husband was on the opposite side of the city and hit the car and came flying all the way across.And the younger child was in the backseat. And I don't remember looking at him, but he didn't seem to be hurt. And the boys turned out to be okay. They had to cut me out of the car with the jaws of life and they were putting me in an ambulance just as my husband to be arrived. And he followed the ambulance and stayed then while they checked out the kids and took them to my mother's house and who was on the third side of the city.And she kept the boys. He came back to the hospital. By the time he came back, I think I was having test run. I don't remember any of this part except for having a reaction to some IVP dye. And I have a flash of being in an elevator and I remember that I felt hot and sweaty.It's weird that I remember the reaction, but that's all. And I just remember hot and sweaty. It was a bad sensation. I was in the hospital for two weeks. I had pelvic fractures, ribs, concussions, and I would call my mother.I could remember her phone number. And from the very beginning, I would call her constantly and I'd say, hi, where am I? Hi. Where am I? Bless her heart.She'd answer the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we'd do it again. This went on a lot, but as the days went by, the concussions got a little bit better. And I remember they took me to a whirlpool bath and using a whole harness system to lower me into this tub. And I'm not sure it helped, but it felt good. So I was released in the hospital after two weeks, and my husband came by every evening and brought outside food because the hospital food was so terrible.So I went home and I was on crutches with no weight bearing all summer. So this was about this time in June, about maybe June 23. And we had a wheelchair. We used to when he'd get home from work, he'd throw the wheelchair in the car and get out of the house because I was getting old stir crazy. And by the end of the summer, we got married.And that's kind of the end of that story. It can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating?An experience or just in general? Does it matter?"

And he was pining over this woman, who had two children of her own. She also had lost her spouse, and they decided they were going to get married and joined their family together. However, the stepmother and the stepsisters were not particularly fond of Cinderella because she was so beautiful, and all of the animals loved her, and her father loved her, and everything she did was just sweet and kind and good, and they were very jealous.So they made her do all of the worst things. They made her do all of the cooking and all of the cleaning, and she didn't get to wear any nice clothes. But she was lucky because she had all the animals as her friends, and they encouraged her and were kind to her. And they noticed that she would look out at this castle and wonder what life would be like in the castle outside of the place she lived. One day, then, the king of that castle wanted his son to meet women in hopes that he would become married.And he sent a notice across the village, and everyone was very excited, including Cinderella. And so her stepsisters were starting to get all of their things together, what they were going to wear and what they were going to do. And Cinderella did the same. She found a book to help her make something, and the animals helped her make something. And then her stepsisters were again so jealous and envious of how beautiful she was that they ruined her dress.And Cinderella was very sad, and her fairy godmother appeared and turned everything into the most beautiful things ever. Her dress was prettier. She had a lovely carriage, and horses should drive the carriage, and she went to the ball. When she got there, the prince wanted to dance with her, because, like everyone else, he noticed that she was the kindest, gentlest, most beautiful creature in the room. And so they danced and danced, and Cinderella noticed it was almost midnight, and her fairy godmother had told her that at the stroke of midnight, everything would turn back to normal and that she needed to be out of the castle by then.So she ran out. But on the way, she dropped her shoe, lost a shoe. She went home and was very, very sad, and they locked her in a room so she couldn't get out. But the mice noticed that the Princess Paige was bringing around a shoe to fit to all the women. And they snuck the keys under the door, and Cinderella got out, and the shoe fit her.And she and the prince lived happily ever after. I'd like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Begin. Okay. If I were to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I would first get out all of my supplies.I would get out a cutting board and I would put my two slices of bread on the cutting board. I would get probably a napkin, the peanut butter, the jelly and a knife."

Well, of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, and she was kind of upset. She thought she wanted to go really bad. So it just so happened that her fairy godmother appears and said, well, Cinderella, if you would like to go, we can fix it so you can go. So the fairy godmother, she dresses Cinderella up in a very fine gown and ball dress and tierra and everything.And she takes a pumpkin and turns it into a carriage, beautiful carriage with horsemen and horses. And they go to the palace and go to the ball. And while they're there at the ball, of course, the prince is out checking on all the young ladies. And the two stepsisters kind of recognize Cinderella and kind of want to keep her in the background. But all of a sudden, the prince happens to notice her and notices that they were trying to put her off.So he decides he's going to take Cinderella and dance with her. And he does. And during the dance, he becomes enchanted with her and thinks, well, she's a fine young lady. I think this is the gal I'd like to spend some more time with. Well, somewhere along the way, Cinderella has glass slippers, and her fairy godmother told her, now, at a certain time in the ball, you're going to have to leave.And so that time comes, and Cinderella is getting ready to leave, and she runs out of the ballroom and down a flight of stairs to her carriage. And as she does, she loses one of her slippers, and she jumps in the carriage, and they take her on back to the house, so she'll be there when the rest of the family gets back. So she's there, and they come back, and they're telling this story about the ball and everything, the fun they have and what went on. And I'm sure they mentioned this story about, well, he picked this girl and she lost her slipper. Well, the prince decides the next day that he wants to find this girl.So he sends one of his servants out or one of his assistants out to the village to look for this girl who wore this glass slipper. And she goes from house to house, and he happens to come to the house where Cinderella lived."

And I had learned to just kind of slow down and accept his pace of speech. And it actually has made me wonder if maybe he once was a stutterer and if this is his way of coping with stuttering, but I haven't asked him that.All right, now, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from any time.It yes.My grandmother was ill, and she didn't tell any of us, but she started losing weight and sleeping a lot, and she finally went in and got diagnosed with bowel cancer.And it was very confusing and scary for all of us because no one in my family had experience with terminal cancer.And the doctor didn't give clear communication about what we should expect. And so initially, we thought that her cancer could be cured with surgery, and later it was revealed that this was stage four cancer, and there was no way it was going to get better.And she very much wanted to stay at home, and I wasn't living in my hometown anymore, so it was my mom that was really taking care of her, and she could no longer take care of my grandmother. It was just overwhelming. She was having a lot of issues. So we brought her back to the hospital, and she kept saying how much she wanted to go home. And mom and my brother, who was in medical school at the time, said it just wasn't possible.We couldn't care for her. I was secretly hoping maybe we could take her home, because for me, there's something very sacred about being able to be in your space. So that didn't happen. She remained in the hospital and got progressively worse, and it happened over a period of weeks. And I remember visiting her in a hospital, and there was light coming in the window and windows, and then she was transferred to another spot and point.She was on a morphine drip, and she was having trouble breathing."

Cellulitis.This I had cellulitis about, I don't know, 1012 years ago. And you want me to talk about it? Okay. So, yeah, I had cellulitis, and I thought I had, like, a stomach flu. My kids were sick, and then I was feeling sick, and I just figured we were all just sick and my husband had to go out of town.He left on a Sunday night, and I wasn't feeling great that morning. I got up and I felt awful. The kids were fine by that point, but by Monday morning, I felt awful. To the point where I remember feeding the kids breakfast. They had their cereal on the table.They were only three and five at the time. And I'd been just put my head on the kitchen table. I couldn't even lift it up. And I called my sister because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting vehemently, and I had been for a long time.I knew something was not right because I actually had been sick for several days, now that I think about it, because I hadn't showered. And I called the doctor. They said, yeah, you need to be seen. And I called my sister, and she thought I wanted her to just stay with the kids. And I said, no, you have to take me.My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive because I can't not throw up. And so she was like, Whatever. Okay. So she came over, and I remember wanting to clean myself because I hadn't showered for days. I thought, I can't go to the doctor.And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower, and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I was cleaning under my arm, and there was this huge lump. I thought to myself, oh, my God. I developed breast cancer, like, overnight, but it was noticeably enlarged. So I thought it was strange, though, because I was sick of my stomach.It didn't seem connected. So my sister took me, and she right away understood, when she saw me, how sick I was, and that I kept having to throw up in the car on the way of the doctor. It was just so bad. I walked in. We had just moved Indianapolis.I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first. That's who saw me. She looked at me, and within 10 seconds she said, I have never met you in my life. You are very sick.I can tell that. I was like, okay, yeah, let me lay down. I laid down on the table because I couldn't even sit up. So they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually cellulitis and that it had turned into this horrific infection. So they were quite concerned about my condition.I had to get blood work right away, et cetera. And apparently they told my sister she is severely, severely ill and she probably should be hospitalized. She's very dehydrated, but we don't want to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're going to see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever too, and my husband came home because he was so worried, I guess my sister I was delirious at this point."

I wish I could find such a job.Now, get a look at them and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. This is a story about the time when I was kicking a ball in our yard and it went into our neighbor's window. Our neighbor was a very intelligent young man by the name of Richard Jenkins. And Richard was a writer and also a professor of literature. So when I sent the ball crashing through his window, I thought he was going to be mad.And I was very reluctant to go fetch the ball. But eventually I did. And he said, look, I will let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me. And that is how I started writing. And I fell so much in love with writing that ever since I have become a writer, I haven't been published, but I have a lot of writings that started with that incident that Mr.Jenkins induced after I broke his window. Okay, so here is a series of pictures. Please take a look at all of them first and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.So this story is about my Aunt Charlote, who was a very mean old lady. And I remember spending a night in her house because of the pandemic.We were caught by a lockdown in her house. And I did not attend school, but I did go to a tutor's house because, of course, there were no schools. But one day I was getting ready to go to my tutor's home, who was doing supplementary work so that I wouldn't miss out on school. That was canceled. And it was raining.It was raining very hard. So I asked my Aunt Charlote for an umbrella, but she said, no, I'm not going to let you use my umbrella. So then I had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realized two things. One, that I was getting wet, which was not comfortable. I did not like that.And the second one, that I had a very good excuse to get a hold of the umbrella. So I went back to my Aunt Charlote. I said, Look, I could get ill, and who knows? I could catch coronavirus because of getting ill. So the only way to prevent this is by you lending me your umbrella.And so faced with this incredible threat, of course, even a mean old lady like Aunt Charlote was would not dare to deny me the umbrella. So she gave me the umbrella, and I was able to walk to the tutor's house with the umbrella.Here is a picture. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right. So I remember this instance very clear."

        "transcript": "And we were walking along the top of the hill and my son slipped and fell and went feet first down the hill. However, he forgot to let go of the sled. So as he went down, he pulled the sled behind him and if he got to the bottom and stopped, the sled came down and hit him right in the face. I, of course, am yelling at him to get stand up and come back up the hill because I don't know why, because when I looked down and I saw that there was blood all over the snow by him. So I ran down and not realizing how bad it was, I picked him up and I just took him back to our car, at which point I looked and he had a huge gap across his face where the sled had hit him.So my husband took my daughter home and I got to rush my son to the children's emergency room. They took us in right away because obviously he was spouting blood all over the place and we got to bypass all the people that were there for their runny noses and all the other things in the emergency room. We went right back in and saw an Er doctor immediately and of course they decided that it was too serious for them to deal with, so they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face. However, there had been a car accident somewhere else, so it had to be a pediatric plastic surgeon because my son was only five. So this plastic surgeon was off somewhere else dealing with people from the car accident.So we just had to sit and wait. So we waited and we waited. Try entertaining a five year old in a hospital bed for about 8 hours while we waited. And we played all kinds of video games. We looked at fish in a tank.He got to the point he'd stopped bleeding. So we were just walking around and of course we couldn't eat or drink anything. Well, he couldn't because they knew he was going to be going into surgery. So I, of course, as his mom, didn't eat or drink anything because I didn't want him to see me doing it. And finally they came, the plastic surgeon came in and they decided he needed to go into surgery.It was about 02:00 A.m. And we went into surgery with the doctor, one nurse. And for some reason me, I went into surgery with them and they got out. This is all my son remembers, this huge long needle and aestheticize his face. And when they got the needle out, he of course starts screaming because it was a very long needle.And for some reason the doctor told me that I needed to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia. And so I held him down and they gave him the shot and then I stood up, and since I hadn't eaten for eight, 9 hours and I'm diabetic, I passed out on the floor of the operating room. And then they had two patients to deal with. And it was strange, but they just brought me some orange juice and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery. So they gave him about, I think, 42 stitches in three layers underneath his nose, going from inside his nose down to his lip.And about an hour and a half later, we walked out of there and we went home. And that was the end of the story. All right, can you tell me the story you see in these four pictures with a beginning, a middle and an end? One sunny day, a little boy went outside and he decided to kick a soccer ball around, was playing and playing, and one time he kicked it too hard and it went and went through the neighbor's window. It went through the window, hit the neighbor's lamp and broke it and then crashed right into the neighbor."

And I was on a motorbike and I was driving the motorbike and my boyfriend at the time was behind me.And imagine I'm driving down the mountain and it's lots of curves and like this, right? And he's behind me and knows that I need coffee, but for some reason thinks it's a good idea to hand me my coffee mug while I'm driving the motorbike. And I'm not thinking because it's morning and I need coffee. And I go to grab the coffee mug and next thing we know, of course the motorbike went. And then boom.I didn't hit my head or anything. I mean, I had his helmet on, but I did fall on my shoulder very hard and broke my collarbone. So I got up off of the road and all of the local Thais come running and they're checking on the motorbike to make sure that it worked. And I'm sitting on the side of the road going, oh, this is not right. This is not right.My boyfriend at the time said, oh, maybe you need to go to the hospital. And I said, I absolutely need to go to the hospital. Well, get on the bike. I'll take you there. And I said, no, thank you.I'm never getting on that thing again. So we tried to hitch a ride and the only car that came along that would give me a ride was a truck full of Thai monks who can't sit next to a woman, even though this woman is injured. So I have to kind of sit in the front and away from this monk so that I don't touch him. And then as I'm going down the mountain from side to side, I can feel it's getting more and more painful. So then they drop me off at a I try to tell them we get down to the bottom of the mountain and you could go to the right to a sort of country hospital or go to the left and go to the big city hospital.And I was trying to tell them in Thai, please turn this please turn this way, and telling them the name of the hospital, chiang Mai Rum. Chiang Mai rum. And they didn't take me there. They took me to the country hospital. So I go to the country hospital and no one knows what to do with this foreigner.And I'm sitting there looking and I can see like morphine right there. I'm like something. I need something. But no one is helping me. And all these people just keep walking around.And so I just got up and walked out to the highway and I caught a taxi. I caught a taxi to the other hospital, which is a taxi. There is a pickup truck, so you have to get into the back of the pickup truck. And the driver was a woman taxi driver, which was really strange because it doesn't really happen all that much. And she was very kind and didn't even charge me because she knew that I was in pain.So then I go in the hospital and I go up to the counter, and it's just the regular part of the hospital. I didn't go in the emergency because I just wasn't thinking. I was just like, this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English, I've been in an accident. I am hurt.I need help now. And they hand me this form and tell me to fill it out. And I have a broken bone, so can't so I'm like so I put it down. I put down the form, and I walk over to the emergency and I immediately start crying my head off. I've been in an accident."

And this gentleman found another woman and decided to marry her. She had two daughters as well, who were a bit older.But when the mother and the stepmother and the two daughters saw this little girl, they said, oh, we don't want you with us. We're going to call you Cinderella, and we will let you sweep the cinders from the hearth, and we don't want you in our lives. Well, Cinderella was very sad about this. She went out to the barn, where she talked with the horse and the dog, and there were some little mice, and she would go out there and talk with them when she was sad, and they all became friends. One day, a letter arrived from the king.Now, the king had a son, a handsome son, a prince who was in need of a wife. And so the king decided to give a ball and invite all the fairlaidies of the land to come to this ball in hopes that the prince would look them all over and find one that he would like to have be his wife. So the stepmother and the daughters were thrilled when they got their invitation. Yes, we will go. One of you surely, said the stepmother, will be the one that the prince will choose.Well, Cinderella heard about this, and she said, I can go, too. And so she went up to her room in the attic, and she opened her chest, and she pulled out a gown that she had, and she put it on. It was pink and white and very pretty. And she ran down to show it to the evil stepmother and the two sisters, and they said, you cannot go to the ball. And they began ripping off the ribbons and the lace, and pretty soon the dress was in tatters.Cinderella ran back up to the room, and she was in tears. And she cried, my beautiful dress. I have nothing else that I can wear to this party. Suddenly, the room was filled with light, and there appeared someone she had never seen before. Who are you?She asked to the strange apparition. Why, I am your fairy godmother, said the woman. My fairy godmother? Yes, and I am here to see to it that you, too, shall go to the ball.By this time, evil's stepmother had locked Cinderella in the room. But the little mice came and brought the key and managed to get the door open. And now, here was Cinderella in her beautiful, beautiful white garment with her hair done up in the most beautiful hairstyle you could imagine, with jewelry. It was gorgeous. She was gorgeous.And so she came down the stairs from her attic, and she appeared downstairs in the living room. And then, not only that, the fairy godmother saw to it that one of the pumpkins in the patch became a beautiful carriage. She did this by simply waving her wand. And Cinderella said, oh, is this carriage for me? Yes.And the horse suddenly became six horses."

When he remarries, the woman that he brings home has two young daughters, cinderella's new stepsisters. As her father dies not too long after, he remarries, leaving Cinderella alone with the new wife and the two stepsisters. As they grow older, Cinderella is made to become a scholarly maid, while the stepmother indulges her daughters and they treat Cinderella very poorly. Cinderella makes friends of the barn animals that are at the house where she is mice, horses, ducks, that sort of thing.But the stepsisters and the stepmothers still don't like her. One day, they receive word that there's going to be a grand ball, and all the young ladies who are eligible to marry are requested to attend. As the king wishes his son, the prince, to marry Cinderella, and the stepsisters are very excited to hear this news. Cinderella goes to her hope chest, where her mother has left her some dresses and patterns. Cinderella uses these patterns and dresses and the assistance of her friends or her animal friends, which include some very savvy mice, to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella to attend the ball.The stepsisters and stepmother find out that this is what Cinderella has planned, and in jealous and angry fit, rip Cinderella's dress to shreds. Cinderella, crying, runs out into the courtyard, where her fairy godmother visits her, tells her that she will send her to the ball, and waves her magic wand, creates a new beautiful gown for Cinderella, as well as a coach with footmen and magnificent horses for her to ride in. Cinderella arrives at the ball, catches the eye of the young prince, and they dance the night away together. At the stroke of midnight, Cinderella, remembering her very godmother's words of warning that she would have to leave the ball at that time, leaves the ball. The prince is upset and tries to follow her.In her hurried rush to leave, she drops one of her shoes, a glass slipper. She makes it back to the coach and is about halfway down the road when it goes back to being a pumpkin and she's in her standard Skullery clothing.It is heard that the girl that the prince was dancing with disappeared and that he's looking for her. The king sends out his archduke to try to find the girl. The duke has the glass slipper in hopes of finding a match to a foot. They get to Cinderella's house.

My regular doctor came in, who's a cardiologist, and he came in to check on me too. And they told me to watch my diet, not to smoke, which I hadn't for a couple of days.So I just decided that was it. And to do some walking to be more active walking, which off and on on that subject and that was about it. On the my re recovery, it was very mild and communication. I think the problem that I have most is with my son. We're not as close as I think either one of us want to be.He's very closed mouth. I don't know much about it, what his life is like.I talk to him maybe once, once every five weeks. There isn't a lot that we talk about. A little bit about his work. Not too much about my life because I'm retired now. We both are avid baseball fans so we do talk about that and that seems to open up the lines of communication more so than anything else.I guess one of the nicest things or greatest things that ever happened was when I was single. My first wife had passed away and I had left Ashland and was living sort of a secluded life on a lake. And I came in to see my dad and I stopped at the filling station, largewood subidway filled up with gas and hey Grandfather, it was my daughter in law. And what are you doing here? And I said, Well, I'm here to see your dad.I said, Where are the girls? At that time they were like preschool. And she says, oh, they're over at Ashland Child Development. And I says oh, you're doing some shopping? She says, yeah.She says, I met the lady that runs that place and she wanted to know about you. And I said, oh, is that right? I said, who is she? Well, that's Diane gave me the last name and I said, she asked about you and what you were doing and this and that. I says, Where are the girls?They said, well, they're at the childcare center. And I says, Well, I guess I could stop over and see got the lady. I said Why'd you say the lady's last name was Stanford? Okay, well I went into a men's store that I'm good friends with and I walked in and I said, Betty, that's owner's wife. I said Are you a city director?She said yeah, and she's sharp. She says, who are you interested in? I said, I'm not interested in anybody. And she says, who are you looking for? Answered, Nothing.I says let me look."

        "transcript": "Okay.Caught me off guard, and I'm having a hard time thinking, take your time. That's something.Well, it's an ongoing affair. After 25 years, my husband's aphasia is moderate to severe. And after having chemo, know, six years ago, it's even worse. It actually had improved, and the chemo really made a difference. Excuse me.You think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget. And one of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left. In fact, he's still gone to the hardware store and things I would have not done before. I make a list of what he was going for because he might forget, and then he has to explain to the people there, although he has had so much therapy, that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants. It's very rare.There's a failure there. He draws a lot of little tiny pictures. But I've learned that to be sure, it's hard to remember, to verify all the time. And he doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend, and maybe he thinks he comprehends. So how do you discern between those two things?That's quite difficult. Does he think he understands perfectly or does he not understand and doesn't really want to say? He doesn't understand, so things like that make it very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him, you can take it to the bank. He totally understands if he sees it written.I know not to ask him numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. I did find out in the last week that he can repeat, thanks to you. And that is something he has never been able to repeat, not even one word. And now he seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he could tell me what I missed on a program.But he can repeat a word if you ask him to repeat a word. It's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability that I've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man, because women are more other women are more caring, more empathetic, less frightened. And I think men are not in general, so there is this learning curve for men. They have this discomfort, and so it's just easier to avoid.And I always feel badly for him because he is left out a lot. And I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter, to explain to people what's wrong and please don't erupt and please turn the TV off, or please turn the radio off, or you don't have to shout, although I don't find that so much. But some people do. People are not comfortable with disabilities. They don't understand.And even if they understand them at first, they feel awkward because they don't know if it's sensitive and it's going to upset you to talk about it always. Tell me, we've been doing this for 25 years. We're not going to get upset about it. It's just what it is. So it is very difficult for him to be in a group of people and not be able to contribute."

And they were unpleasant to her because she always seemed to make everything look happy and bright. Even animals cheered up when they were around her, because she just let off this gift of light and love. And the sisters were very jealous, and the stepmother was very jealous also.So they mistreated Cinderella and had her do terrible things that none of them wanted to do. So Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in. And the castle. There was a family, obviously, who lived there, and the prince was looking to find love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all, everyone in the entire village come to this ball. So Cinderella's stepsisters got all of their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things.And Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball. And since her stepmother and her stepsisters didn't help her, all of the animals did. So the animals who loved Cinderella because she was so good, put together a beautiful gown for her. And just as Cinderella thought she was going to get out of the house, her stepsisters and her stepmother ruined her gown and she was very, very sad. And the stepsisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with ripped up dress and nothing to do.So this fairy godmother showed up and said, cinderella, you are such a nice person. You're such a good person and you have so much love to give and so much light. I really want you to go to the ball. So I'm going to create a horse and carriage and a new outfit for you. And it's going to be so lovely.But it ends at midnight, so you have to make sure you come home before then. So Cinderella goes to the ball. And her stepsisters were not pleased because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in, because she was just so beautiful. And the prince, of course, noticed her beauty and grace and again, this kind of calm, light, soothing to people that she let off. And he danced with her.And just then she realized it was almost midnight, and so she ran out. She lost one of her shoes and she didn't even make it home when everything went past the way that it was.And then one of the people who worked at the castle came around with the slipper that was found at the ball and tried it on every woman in town, and it fits Cinderella. And Cinderella found her prince, or the prince found her by her dainty little glass shoe, and they lived happily ever."

I had night sweats. I was tired and didn't think much of it.But then I noticed that I was losing weight and that's what caused me to seek a to. I hadn't been to a doctor in years, so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now both our physician for both of us. She did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram because she palpated and she felt something that lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan that led to the need for a biopsy.So by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong. The decision was going to be it was lymphoma, but is it going to be Hodgkin's lymphoma or non Hodgkin's lymphoma? So I went to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy. But that wasn't enough. Not enough tissue was obtained.So I had to go into the city, into New York, to Sloan for a more complete biopsy. And that clinched it. It was Hodgkin's lymphoma, which in the great scheme of things, was the better of the two. Hodgkins has much more treatable, higher success rate. So I started chemo, and after the first session I developed a rash and we weren't quite sure what was going on.One of the nurses, the oncologist, wasn't sure, and he was going to proceed with treatment for the Hodgkins, but one of his nurses said, this is an allergic reaction. And it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to alipurinol. I think I mentioned this last time, which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout, but it has the protective effect for kidney function. That landed me in the hospital with what's called Steven Johnson syndrome, which is treated like a burn.People with Steven Johnson are often sent to burn units. My mouth was inflamed. It was just awful. I couldn't drink water. It burned.That, of course, suspended chemo. We worked through the Stevens johnson. I was looking forward to chemo. It was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the So. And I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather.But still, I couldn't take solid food for two weeks or so, nor water. The only thing that really worked was iced tea.So I got through this. Stevens Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months. It ended last May."

It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently.It was February 1978. It had been snowing all day. And in fact, that was the year when we had the blizzard of 1978.And we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon on this day in February, when my husband came home from work where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church, he said, Carla, come in the house. I want to tell you something. Want to ask you something. So I said, okay.So I followed him in, taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He said, Sit down for a minute. So I said, OK, I'm sitting. What do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years?Kenya? I said, where's Kenya? He said, It's on the equator, where it's hot, no snow. I said, count me in. Let's go.And so we did. He had received an invitation to come and work with the National Christian Council of Kenya in a family life education program where he would be responsible for setting up a counseling center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in community health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it.And so four months later, we had sold our house, our car, most of our household possessions, with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend and our family of four. My husband Ted, our two daughters, Michelle, aged nine and Cindy, aged five. And I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, Pennsylvania, because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran in background and he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite mission program. Well, who are the mennonites?We don't know. So we were invited to a ten day orientation period in the heart of Mennonite country in Akron, Pennsylvania, where we spent ten marvelous days getting to know the Mennonites and also a group of other people who were about to embark on Mennonite sponsored mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three year period of high adventure for our family. One of the best times in our lives.Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see with a beginning, a middle and an end.Well, in the beginning a little boy is outside playing with his soccer ball.

And I said, no, I'm not, because it wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and whatnot. So kept saying no, and she said, yeah, you're having a baby today.And that was really, like, late afternoon when that happened. And by about 06:00, I think it was, I started feeling more stuff happening. And still I didn't think there was any big deal. It wasn't like, enough. And I think we must have arrived at the hospital by 730 ish.It was like, okay, yeah, this is real. It's time. And so on the way to the hospital, and my husband I think this is my first child he get him kind of confused anyway. He's, of course, like, oh, my gosh, you're going to have a thing. We did not right now, of course.I was having contractions in the car at one point. He was speeding, like, he was speeding, and he barely would stop for the lights. And we all continued to laugh because my words were I yelled at him to slow down and said, it's not about you, it's about me.I know it sounds ridiculous, but he and I just always laugh at that. Still to this day, it's not about you, it's about me. Which was a stupid thing to say, but who's rational at that point? So we got to the hospital, and she was born at about 1135. Boy, what kind of a mom am I?I don't even remember. Somewhere after 1130, because I remember when she was born then that I was thinking about what date it was. It was the 14th. And that somebody had hoped that if I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday. And I had missed that window.But anyway, of course that's incredible when you hold your first child in your arms for the first time. But I was exceedingly grateful that it was a relatively quick know. That's not to say it didn't hurt, Ashley. That's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a great experience, all in all. And then we had our first baby, Wild.Now she's 22. Is that enough? Also, tell a story. Take a second to look at them, and then when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Once there was a boy named Sam. Sam loved to play soccer, but it was during the coronavirus pandemic, so Sam could not play soccer with his soccer team. The best he could do was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around. He kicked and kicked and kicked, and eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house. His neighbor was an adult man named Ferdinand."

        "transcript": "So Jonathan was playing with his soccer ball outside. It was a pretty sunny you know, sometimes when you're practicing some soccer, things get a little out of hand. And so his soccer ball went through the glass window of his neighbor, Mr. Willis, who is in the middle of watching TV, just relaxing, and the soccer ball lands right in his lap, so there was no escaping that. So then he picks up the ball and looks outside and sees Jonathan, who is then running away because he realizes that he made a terrible mistake against Mr.Willis. Okay, excellent. So we're going to do the same thing with another one. Take a look at these pictures, and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.So James is on his way to school. He walks to school every day, and his mom said, you know, James, you should take your umbrella. I really think you should take your umbrella. It's supposed to rain today. And James was like, no, mom, it's sunny right now.It's going to be fine. I'm not going to take the umbrella. He probably wouldn't say it with that vernacular because he's like, seven. But he goes outside, it starts raining, and he's like, oh, no, I don't have my umbrella. My mom was so right.So he runs home in the rain and gets all wet. All his books get wet in his backpack. He gets home, and his mom is less than pleased with him because he's dragged his wet shoes himself into the house, and she's looking very sternly at him. And so now James is always sure to pack his umbrella because he does not want to get in trouble again. Okay, good.Okay, we're going to do the same thing with this one. This is a little bit different. It's kind of a scene. So take a look at the entire picture, and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.It a man, philip was walking down the street, and he gets a little startled by this growling dog that had jumped the fence of a house in the neighborhood. This dog had jumped the fence and was very ferocious. So the man got scared and switched his pace from walking to a full on sprint. And in the way of how fight or flight works, he climbs up a tree and gets in a branch to get away from the dog. And meanwhile, this cat was also startled.This is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood. And the cat also got startled because of this dog, and so it climbed up the tree. Now this little girl is riding her tricycle and sees this cute little cat, and so she's trying to coax it down from the tree. Meanwhile, another fellow walker on the street saw what the whole scene was going, what was happening, and how there's not only this cat stuck in the tree, but also a man stuck in the tree who's afraid to get down. So the filed, the fire department gets called and the fire department comes with their ladders to rescue the man and the cat."

        "transcript": "All right, this starts with the stepmother and the two daughters. And there's a gentleman in the next picture with a little girl who is cinderella, who is cursing and all pleasant, and they obviously aren't. I presume this is going to be her father, but he never shows up again.This. Sisters and mother treat Cinderella like she's a servant and they're very unkind to her. And as a result, she makes friends with the animals. And down the road, the stepmother gets a letter inviting everyone to a ball at the castle because the prince's father, the king, thinks it's time for him to find a wife. And everyone is invited, and the girls are all very excited, and Cinderella thinks she's so she there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk.And the only thing I can think that is, is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instruction. So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom and makes with the help of the mice, they make a dress. And she gets ready the night of the ball to go and is told that this was not for her. She's not allowed to go. And I recall they rip her dress to shreds and they go on to the ball, and she kind of goes back to her little lofty place.The next thing we see is we've got the mice and animals around being empathetic. And then her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother whips her up. A beautiful white gown and a pumpkin carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, but something scared the horses and that was before this. So, anyway, the pumpkin carriage is all good.She gets in the carriage. The fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight or it all goes away. So she goes to the ball. The Stepmother and sisters are abhorred to see her and not happy at all. And the Prince is enchanted.And they spend the evening dancing. And all of a sudden, she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight. And she takes off running and going down the stairs. She loses one of the glass slippers provided by the fairy godmother. And the prince finds it.And she gets home and she's sitting with the animals, looking at the glass flipper with good memories. So now the prince still has a glass flipper, and he sends everyone out looking for the girl with the other glass slipper. And when they hear about this, the stepmother and the stepsisters, they realize it was her. And they don't want him to know. So they lock her in her room.However, the little animals, the mice especially, bring a key to get her to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper. And that is what happened. She goes downstairs, tries on the glass slipper. The prince realizes he's found his bride. And that's about the end of the stepmother and stepsisters.And the last we see is they're getting married. Living happily ever after. Beautifully. I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay.The best peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made with white bread. Totally unhealthy, but it's so good. Um, so you need two pieces of white bread and a knife and a plate. And you need peanut butter. I didn't mention this before, but it's much better if it doesn't have sugar in."

        "transcript": "And of course she was pretty upset by that.The stepsisters were decked out in all their fancy regalia and the stepmother was beautifully dressed herself. And they took the family's coach and left to go to the mall, leaving Cinderella behind near the fireplace, crying her well, as she was crying, something happened and she looked around and there was a very sweet older lady standing there. And Cinderella of course, is kind of surprised to see this. By the way, I'm not clear at all where the father was during all this. He apparently traveled a lot and so he was gone.So anyway, the woman introduced herself to Cinderella, telling her that she was her fairy godmother and she was there to grant her wishes. Well, Cinderella was taken aback, quite thrilled at this whole possibility. And so the fairy godmother said, you will go to the. And she I think the very first thing she did was to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella and her beautiful hairdo and lovely tiara type thing to put in her hair and beautiful slippers to put on her feet, which were very unusually made out of glass.But Cinderella said, how can I get to the ball? The carriage is gone, I can't walk. Especially not in glass slippers. And so the Fairy Godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin, created a coachman and other servants out of the mice, and I think made the rats into horses. So anyway, there they were, all set, ready to go to the ball.So she left. Cinderella left in all her finery and went to the ball, walked in and the whole place came to a hush. Everybody's looking at her and thinking who is that beautiful young woman? And of course, guess who was the most impressed was the Prince. So he immediately asked her to dance.And after they had one dance, he was really not interested in anybody else, so they had a lovely time. Suddenly though, Cinderella remembered the most important thing that the fairy Godmother had told her, which was at the stroke of midnight she had to leave the ball. Because if by the end of twelve bell strikes she was still there, everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were rodents. So she was remembering that and thinking, oh, I really have to be careful. But she was so carried away by this lovely time that she was having with the Prince and he was so falling so much in love with her.That time went on really fast and all of a sudden, bang. She started to hear. She heard the first stroke of midnight. So she ran. She said, I have to go man out of the palace.And the Prince ran after her. And the Prince's fancy servant ran after her. She's running down the steps of the palace."

They probably get married because that seems like the sort of thing you should do if a strange guy kisses you awake after you've been drugged. And she's probably like, 14.Perfect. The end. Little Red Riding Hood. Oh, boy. Same deal.Okay. And while you're looking at the pictures, I am going to she's a vicious predator.More small, furry creatures. Oh, a big furry creature.What big eyes you have.It it okay. All right. Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood. So Little Red Riding Hood is this little brat who always wears a red hood, I think, because she thinks it looks cool.I did the same thing when I had like maybe 6th or 7th birthday. I don't remember. I got flippers and goggles and a snorkel. And I literally never took them off, even to sleep. I had the worst leg cramps.It was sad. But anyway, I think Little Red Riding Hood's doing the same thing and she's gotten a reputation for wearing it. So she's called Little Red Riding Hood. And one day, I mean, she lives with her mom. I don't know where the dad is.He probably ran out on her. But probably because she wears that red hood all the time, I think that's the source of all her problems. So she lives with her mom, and one day the woodcutter comes to her little cottage in the woods. Maybe the woodcutter is her dad. He's just stopping by every so often to keep taps on her.But he doesn't actually want any fatherly responsibilities. But he comes up and he says, hey, Snow White. And Snow White Red Riding Hood. And your mother. I was just out at your grandma's cottage and she is kind of sick.Like, you should probably go see her before she dies. That's not true. He didn't say that. Maybe it was implied. Then again, why would you leave your grandmother in a cottage all on her own?That doesn't make sense. She's probably okay. She just has a cold. She's not terminally ill. Good.So that is what the woodcutter says. Says, your grandma caught a cold because she went dancing naked in the rain and then didn't take care of herself. And so Little Red Riding Hood says, mom, I love dancing naked in the rain."

And the women whom she served were not very appreciative. They were pretty snarky.She would sit by her window and from her room she had a direct view to the castle in the distance. And she often dreamed of a better life. She had a mystical way with animals. And although she was lonely, she had friends who were the animals in the barn and also some mice and some birds. Bluebirds specifically.One day a proclamation came and the Prince was having a ball. And the woman and her two daughters were invited. And Cinderella got very excited and dreamed of the possibility of going. But of course, she was not on the invitation list, nor did she have the right clothes. So these magical mice got together and they showed Cinderella a special magic chest where wishes come true.And she wished for a gown. And a gown was made and a necklace so that actually she could go to the ball. But one of these young women ripped the necklace from her and she was very discouraged. She felt that she couldn't attend. And the mice intervened again and brought her a wise old fairy godmother.And the Godmother said, I will make you a beautiful gown and slippers and a pumpkin coach so that you can attend the ball. But there's only one stipulation. The spell will only last until the stroke of midnight, so you must be back before the stroke of midnight or the illusion will be broken. So she went to the ball and she danced with the prince. And they had a wonderful time.But she looked up and noticed it was almost midnight. So she quickly ran away. But in the process of exiting, she left her glass slipper behind.But she managed to make it home with one slipper th just as the pumpkin coach was turning back into a pumpkin.

She was over and worked. She'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the two main sisters.There was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse. Cinderella was always mopping, mopping, cleaning, cooking, doing all the things, scrubbing on the floor with her hands and knees. Cinderella received a delivery. It was sealed and the delivery went to the stepmother. Stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody, read it out to the sisters and to Cinderella.Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited, but as it turned out, she was not. So the stepmother denied her that, and I would imagine stepmother and daughters were off to the ball. They were invited to a ball. The prince was having a ball.Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the ball. In fact, she tried on or looked at a dress that she would like to wear if she were going to the ball. She imagined the dress, and then she looked at pictures of the dress.She was friends with all the small creatures.They decided to make a dress for her. So they sewed and they spun and they weaved and applique the bows on the dress.She didn't know this was happening. She glanced at the castle and probably heard the music.The birds came, and the mice to tell her that they had a special surprise for her.She was so delighted with the dress. Meanwhile, the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing off to the ball. And Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her dress and shreds. I believe that they may have been responsible.She cried. Everybody was sad. Her friends, the animals, small creatures.The fairy godmother heard her plays and her sorrow, and she came and waved her magic wand and turned Pumpkin into."

So he decided to throw a big party, a ball, and send out word throughout the kingdom that there would be this ball and a princess chosen for the prince. Well, the two ugly stepsisters, unpleasant stepsisters, decided they should go to the ball and bickered a little bit among themselves, but found clothes and the stepmother dressed them and made sure that they looked properly and they went off to the wall.Cinderella, who was the younger one, wanted to go to, but the stepmother, no, it's not appropriate. And the sister said no, she couldn't possibly be chosen. They shouldn't go in any case. In the meantime, Cinderella found some things in a trunk, I believe, in the attic or something. And her fairy godmother appeared and said well, of course she could go to the ball and provided her with a beautiful dress, turned pumpkin into a carriage and some mice into horsemen or two horses, and Cinderella went off to the ball.At the ball she was spotted by the prince, who wanted to dance with her because he thought she was the most attractive girl there. And she did dance with the prince. But one of the things that the fairy godmother had told her was that she must be back by midnight or the coach would turn back to a pumpkin and the horses to mice and her fancy dress would go back to her normal clothes. And so suddenly, just as the clock began to strike twelve and she was dancing with the prince, she remembered that ran quickly out the door, losing one of her slippers on the way.And by the time the prince got outside and looked around, there was no coach with horses."

Hilarious.Okay, so now I would like for you to tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at. Okay. So, once upon a time, there was a princess, and her name was Snow White. And her name was Snow White because her skin was as white as snow.Her hair was as dark as, like a raven's feathers or something like that. And her lips were as red as a rose.She was beautiful.I don't know how she has a stepmother, assuming she had parents. And then her mother died, and then her father died, and then he or sorry, mother died, father remarried, then father died because he would hope that he would step in. So Snow White was reduced to doing chores a lot like other premises of fairy tales. And while she did this, she was contented with her dream. Prince didn't get out of the castle very much.And there's this really famous scene where she's singing over wishing well, and her voice is echoing back to her. So she says, I wishing, and then it echoes back. And she's basically saying that one day she'll get saved from this by a prince.So the stepmother was not very happy that Snow White was as beautiful as she was because she was used to being the fairest in all the land. And she has a mirror that when she asks, mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? The mirror responds that she is the fairest of them all. Usually in Ryan that there are none as beautiful as she. And one day, when the queen, who has very low self esteem, asked the mirror who the Ferris in the land was, the mirror responded that pretty fickle mirror that Snow White was in fact the Ferris of them all.So having not to be bested by Snow White's good looks, their stepmother orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and to kill her.It's pretty messed up. You could have just maimed her, right? Like acid or so the hunter takes Snow White into the forest. And in the version that I know, snow White figures out that she's in trouble and she runs away from the hunter when he tries to kill her. And that's how she gets away.And while she's running into the forest, she gets lost in the wood, and she comes upon a house in a clearing. She gets to the house, and she realizes that everything is small and that it's filthy. So she's doing what she does best chores. She gets right to work with her animal friends, I think she sings a song, and they clean."

Midnight. So she goes to the ball and she has a great time and suddenly she's dancing with a prince and he's enamored with her and he spends all time with her.And she looks at the clock and it's a couple of minutes to twelve, she has to leave.

It was basically in a prison that they would take the prisoners across that and you'd never see the prisoners again. Went from there to Padawa. And Padawa was St.Anthony, who helps you find things. I'm a good Catholic boy. I can remember some of this stuff. But in Was, we got to see where he was born and where he was buried. That one really wasn't very exciting.Then we went from there to Assisi, which is St. Francis of Assisi, which a lot of people have heard of St. Francis, but we got to go to the cathedral basilica where he got a vision from God that said, rebuild my church. And he thought it was talking about this little church that was in Assisi. So he went to the little church and rebuilt it.And then God said no, gave him more of a clarification and got him going. But we got to see where his little church was, which is now inside of a big basilica. We got to see where he was born. We got to see his basilica, which is huge. And it was interesting there.Interesting thing was they had been having earthquakes there, so there were lots of I'm not an artist, so lots of wall paintings that had big cracks in them, and they were starting to do the repair work on it. And then the last part of that in Assisi, we went to where Francis was a monk and where his community was, and they had a real neat thing. And in fact, we were a group of Americans, and there was one guy from Ireland that came and talked to us, and he could talk to us in English. None of the other know everybody else was Italian. So he talked to us in English, gave us the real story, and that was very moving.St. Francis is now my favorite. Uh, let's see, from there we went to Florence, and Florence was interesting story there. It's funny, during the day it was okay, but towards the late afternoon, it started raining and it rained, and it rained and it rained. And dinner was supposed to be out on the big plaza in Florence, and I didn't want to go to dinner there because it was just raining.So we walked back to our hotel, which was probably a mile and a half, maybe 2 miles. We, that would be myself, my wife, her sister, and her sister's husband. We got back to the hotel, changed into dry clothes because we were soaked all the way through. And then it was dinner time, and we were trying to figure out what we were going to do for dinner, which ended up being McDonald's."

Okay, he's listening. So if I get it wrong, you correct me, okay? Ted always used to correct my stories for me, so you tell me if I get it wrong.I was in the house. I was giving a piano lesson. I was deeply involved in that and unfortunately I did not hear when Ted fell from the attic. It was either from the attic or from high on the ladder leading up to the attic. Anyway, he fell and he sustained a severe head injury, called 911, went to the hospital to went to Methodist Hospital where he had emergency surgery that lasted 3 hours.They put his skull back together and then the doctor said, I can fix the skull, but I can't fix the problem with the brain. He had unfortunately, fortunately he hit the left side of his head and it took away his ability to speak. Also it left him with paralysis on the right side of his. And so Ted was in the hospital for was in one hospital for a month, and then he spent another hospital, another month at Community Rehab Hospital. And after that, three more months getting subacute therapy at Hamilton Trace.So that was a total of five months in which he had intensive and then subacute therapy, both physical therapy and speech therapy. After that he came home and he still continued to have more physical therapy at home. And the main purpose of that was to try to help us see how we could best manage at home. Ted's aphasia is pretty severe. Ted can say yeah if he means yes and no if he means yes, and sometimes I don't know.And Ted can sing if it's a song that we all know. For example, we recently sang Happy Birthday to our daughter who had a nice birthday, and he can count a little bit, but pretty much that's it. So what to do after we had the home physical therapy? And then they said that was the end. Then he had three more months of outpatient physical therapy until that ended in November, September, October and November.After that we were able to get him signed up at Neurohope for the physical therapy part. Are you familiar with Neurohope? Neurohope is an amazing place.Just very quickly. It was started by a man named Chris Liu. Chris Liu sustained severe neck injury and became quadriplegic. Approximately eight years ago. He went to a physical therapy place in Utah and he was able to regain a surprising amount of return of function.And after that, he and his family said, we must help other people who need continued therapy even though their insurance money has run out. So he did that. And Ted has continued to be a patient at Neurohope except that now that we have the quarantine twice a week, we have home exercises via Zoom."

And ah, the evil stepmother has a nasty cat and the nice stepdaughter has a goofy but friendly dog.Soon the king tells his son, the prince, that he has to have a bride to be a princess because that's the way it works in evil monarchies. And the king is so annoying that the prince will probably kick him out of the house or will he become king and he has to have a princess who will become queen. So the declaration is made throughout the land.Cinderella, the nice depot, finds a book in a chest in the attic, which has absolutely nothing to do with the story, but she also finds a dress that would be great to wear. She puts on the dress and her evil stepsisters laugh at her because she's not going to go to the ball because she's nobody.I think I've missed a couple pages with OD looking animals, but this is the main part of the story. Cinderella is sad she can't go to the ball, but fairy godmother appears and fairy godmother presents her with a carriage with goofy looking horses that's a pretty goofy looking carriage too. And helps her get dressed and she goes to the ball. At the ball. The prince is dancing with all the eligible women at the ball and eligibility includes being between 16 and 20 years old, being high class and having the right creed, religion, race and financial status.And when he dances with Cinderella, she's wonderful and somehow she knows how to do these dances and he likes dancing with her. But suddenly she realizes it's almost midnight and she has to go or her weird looking carriage will turn into a pumpkin. Pumpkins don't travel on old unpaved roads very well at all. So she gets going and pretty soon it does happen. The carriage turns into a pumpkin and and the horses sit on their butts and won't go any further.But somehow she does manage to make it."

        "transcript": "So luckily I haven't had any injuries or significant illnesses. But the first time I did have to go into the hospital was when I had my son. And at that time I had to have a Caesarean section. So pretty common surgery. But I guess the scariest thing was they gave me the epidural and afterwards being size from the waist down was quite an interesting feeling, I should say.And my son had to go into a special care nursery, so he wasn't in my room with me, and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the special care nursery so that I could nurse him. So that was a rather scary kind of feeling. And I guess because I've worked with people with stroke and other neurological disorders, it kind of gave me at least a little bit of an inkling of what they go through and how they feel not being able to have some motor control. So luckily that only lasted for a few hours and then it wore off. But that was actually the first time I ever had to go into the hospital when I was in my 30s giving birth to my son.Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating before? Yes. Tell me what the problems were and a little bit about what you did about it. Okay, well, I am the Associate Director of the Aphasia Lab at the University of South Carolina, so I work with people with Aphasia every day and have been a speech pathologist for over 30 years. So I guess you could say I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last 30 years of my working life.And what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people who are cognitively intact but yet are not able to express themselves. So I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So have just always been really interested in ways to improve. And of course, for the last four years is when I've been at the Aphasia Lab. So we focused on Aphasia and being able to, number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication.But also I teach the Adult Language Disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well, and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication supported conversation with family members and just trying to improve, in general, people's ability to communicate no matter what their verbal communication is like and no matter what their cognitive skills are either. I have done research both with people with stroke but also with brain injuries. So I've worked with people with lots of different levels of cognitive and language disorders. So just, I guess, maximizing as much as we can ways for people to express themselves. Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life.It could be happy. It could be sad. It could be from when you were a child. It could be from more recently.I guess it could be. So I have two children, and one of my children is adopted and one is not. So I already told the story about my son being born, so I guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption. We tried to have children for many years and couldn't get pregnant. And we went through lots of fertility treatments, and they didn't really find anything that would cause us not to get pregnant.But I was bound and determined to be a mom."

So Cinderella has two stepsisters, and I'm not sure if her father is a prince, her prominent person, but the stepsisters get favored all the time by the stepmother, and Cinderella, in effect, has to serve them, wait on them, clean the house, do all the heavy lifting, while the two sisters don't have to do anything. And then they get invited to a ball, a dancing ball, and they're all excited. And it looks like Cinderella had a dress to wear and was planning on going to the ball, but it looks like they took the ribbon off of her dress, which I don't remember. I thought she didn't have anything that she wasn't expected to go, but from the book, it looked like she had found something to wear.But anyway, so the stepsisters went without her thinking. Cinderella was not going to go. And then a fairy godmother came and helped Cinderella with a beautiful dress and a fantastic carriage that she turned into from a pumpkin and mice that turned into horses. And she goes in this grand style to the ball. And of course, the prince likes her the best and dances with her the most.And then she's got to leave suddenly at noon, at midnight, because her fairy godmother said, you can have all this, but it's only good until midnight and then be home by then because everything is going to go away. The horses turn back into mice, the carriage turns into a pumpkin, and you are going to have your regular clothes on. So she leaves at midnight, and the prince is heartbroken. And in the course of her running away to make it by midnight, she drops one of her glass slippers and the prince gets it.So then the prince has his men search high and low for every woman who can try this glass slipper on, and that's how he finds her. So it only fits her foot. So she tries it on, and then the prince has identified her, and they get married and they live happily ever after. For your first task, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And you may begin.Okay. First you go into the kitchen and you find the bread.And you untwist a little twisty of the bread. And you pull out two pieces of bread. I'm assuming you're making one sandwich. Then you find the peanut butter. You untwist the lid.And if I haven't said, get a knife, get a knife out of the drawer and just stick your knife in the peanut butter jar and scoop out a big glob of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the."

They packed the truck with all their toys and they gathered all the rats.Some climbed in the front of the cab. Some of the younger rats climbed in the back.Off they went, down the road, up a great big hill with flowers and bushes. It was a very bumpy road with lots of rocks.When they hit one particularly large rock, a little girl rat with her baby with her stuffed animal, flew right out of the back of the truck.The truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic, not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls. She lay alongside the road, watching the truck drive off in the distance.The rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic, and they all climbed out of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys. Some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water. Some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers. It was a beautiful lake and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time.Grandpa Rat played the fiddle while Grandma sat next to her and Mother and Father Rat watched their children play. Everybody was having so much fun, except for the little rat who had fallen out of the truck. She sat alongside the trail, hugging her stuffed animal to her and crying. She was so scared and lonely.The wood seemed so big and scary. She looked every which way and didn't know what to do. The flowers were pretty, and she looked at the red flowers around her and the yellow flowers.Meanwhile, back at the lake, father called all the little rats to come and have lunch.Back in the woods, the little rat the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her. She found that they were very, very yummy, and she filled up on juicy red raspberries. Meanwhile, back at the lake, the family started to realize that something was wrong. They were missing the little girl rat. The children sat and waited while the parents searched and called, but she was nowhere to be seen.They looked in the water and along the edges. They looked under rocks and in the grass. They were sad. Some of the young rats were even crying. They did not know what had happened to their little sister."

First, you fill the carafe with water and pour that into the coffee machine. Then I put a filter in the machine and add coffee grounds, about seven scoops. Then I put the cara underneath the filter and turn on the machine and wait. So now it is your turn.Tell me how to plant a flower in a garden.Going on the assumption you've already bought the flowers, we'll go out, take a trowel or some tool to dig a hole approximately a couple inches in circumference, bigger than the pot that you're going to take the flower out of to put into the hole.Put in some fertilizer."

I still ride it some of the time. It now. I'd like you to tell me about a time that you've had an experience you've had with someone who has had a difficult time communicating.Hmm.Oh, yes. I remember this from last time because the only examples I could really think of were my mother and mother in law and father in law because they both had health problems which affected their ability to communicate. The one I really didn't talk about was my mother for the last two or three years that she was alive, was getting focus, was getting dementia, mild dementia, certainly not Alzheimer's, but her short term memory was really starting to go. So I call her on the phone about once a month or sometimes more, if there was anniversaries and birthdays and things like that, or we were planning to come to Philadelphia. And this started while she was still living at the house.I grew up in Elkins Park, north side of Philadelphia area, and I would talk to her on the phone and say, me and Gina are coming in May. We're going to New Jersey, and then we'll be in Philadelphia. And, oh, how long are you going to be here? Visiting my brother. And we'll visit you for a few days, and then we might go see my cousin.Oh, that's nice. When are you coming? Well, around Memorial Day and the week after Memorial Day. And how long are you going to be here? Oh, you're going to visit anybody else?I'm going to go see my brother. I'm going to see my cousin. And we would just do this exact same conversation two or three times, and then we talk about jeans, doing belly dance. I'm like, oh, I didn't know that. Often did she do it?And then we talk about that, talk about the house, and she said, well, am I going to ever see you again? When are you going to come visit? And went about two weeks, Memorial Day. And it would be really frustrating. But after I got kind of used to it, I had just tried not to lose my patience and just tell the story again.Third time or fourth time, it was just really short term because she'd remember other things going back to going back to the 1920s. I think she when she was born, she had a very good memory for a lot of things, especially for were people in the family that were unpleasant to her 50 years ago. She remember, but remembers vacations and different places."

But the main thing was to drink a lot of fluids and rest and just keep myself in good shape and not get run down, I suppose right now I don't usually have a difficult time communicating but I do at this particular time have a difficult time communicating with the manager of the townhouse complex where I live. And I think it's because when I make suggestions to improve conditions there, she perceives it as me being critical. And like if I say well, can we trim this tree or can this tree be trimmed or something like that, then she takes that as being critical.So I find communicating with her as a challenge. And at this point, I'm just about to the point where I don't even want to communicate with her because it's not worth my time or effort. And besides that, it doesn't really make all that much difference anyway. So that's probably my most I would say there's been times in the past with students who they don't understand what you have said, but you just have to go over it again with them. But I find that's just a normal part of teaching.Well, at my age, of course, there are sad one has experienced sad events, death of loved ones, et cetera. But I guess I would choose to focus on the things that are the most positive. And that would have to be, of course, the birth of my three children. Those were very positive events. Think back on that.You were very happy that they were born and they were healthy and very grateful. I wanted boys all three times. I got boys all three times. Although now I could see the advantage of having a daughter. But I do have daughter in law, so that's a problem.The other very happy times in my life have been the times where I've traveled and met people. I've been all over the world and I do a lot of mission work. So communicating with those folks and being able to share something with them and to go back and see the progress they have made and that's a very gratifying position to be in. Story of a little boy playing ball. Or kickball, I guess.Or he's kicking a ball and he kicks it through a window. Breaks a window. The ball falls in a man's lap as he's sitting in a chair and knocks over a lamp. Breaks the window, knocks over it and the man then picks up the ball and goes to the window, looks out."

And then the stepmother had beautiful dresses made for her two daughters, but not Cinderella. And Cinderella, with the help of her forest friends or her animal friends, and fairy godmother, made a beautiful dress.Well, I guess the fairy godmother didn't help that yet. Well, Cinderella made a dress, and then she was planning to go, and the stepmother said, no, you're not going anywhere. You're going to stay home and clean the house. We're going to the ball. And Cinderella was sad.Then she had her dress kind of tore up and by the stepsisters, and then everyone left for the ball except for Cinderella. And then she made a wish, and the fairy godmother was there, and she granted her wish that she would get to go to the ball. So using the forest animals, they created everything. She needed a beautiful gown. They turned the pumpkin into a coach, they changed the mice into horses, and everybody participated.But the thing is, they told her she had to be home by midnight when the clock struck midnight, because the magic would wear off. So Cinderella went to the ball and she came in, and everybody was since it was kind of a masquerade kind of ball, too, not everybody knew who everybody was, depends on which version you watch. So she went in and everyone danced with the prince, and the prince fell in love with Cinderella and wanted to dance the night away with her. But she noticed it was getting close to midnight, so she was leaving the ball. He was chasing her.Then when she was going, when she was on the steps, she lost one of her glass slippers, which miraculously didn't change back into what it was prior. And she got to the cart just as she got to the carriage, just as it was striking midnight. And then on her way home, it changed back into forest animals and vegetables or pumpkins. But she got home, and Cinderella's sisters got home, stepsisters got home with the mom, and they couldn't believe who this girl was who was at the ball, that they weren't treated like they were the fairest of them all. The prince wanted to find out who it was that was at the ball, since no one knew who Cinderella was.And he decided to go on a search for the love of his life by having all the girls in the kingdom try on the glass slipper. And he searched and he searched, and then he finally stopped at the house where Cinderella and her family lived, and they tried the slippers on the sisters. Each of the girls tried to shove their feet in them, but they didn't fit. And then they whined. And then they weren't going to try anybody else because they didn't know about Cinderella."

I have one thing I could say, but I'd be in tears, so I can't go there. Probably the most important thing that's happened in our lives was the day he had the stroke.And how much detail do you want? As much as you want to give. Okay.At the time he had a stroke, he was working as an executive at a gasoline company. And actually, that's not true. He had a different position by then, but he was doing an audit of a gasoline station, and we owned some gift shops that I managed. And I had come home early because my daughter was ill and school had said, come pick her up. I brought her home, fed her, I just sent her up to bed.She didn't feel well. And my phone rang and it was one of the people who worked for my husband as a young man in his thirty s. And he says, Anne, I'm here with your husband, and I know he hasn't been feeling well, but this goes on and on. But he's on the floor. We're in the back of this gas station convenience store, and he's on the floor and his eyes are open, but he keeps wanting to close them and he can't seem to talk.And I realized right away he had had a stroke, just because I'm a nurse. And I said to him, Is he breathing? And he said yes. And I said, do you know how to do CPR? And he said no.I said, well, here's what I want you to do. I want you to first call 911 and tell them to get there. And when they do, call me back. I said, and in the meantime, I want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do CPR in case we need it. So he did that and he came back and he says, well, one guy says he saw it done on TV.I'm going well, it's not real helpful, but okay. He says, but I can hear the sirens right now. And I said, that's good. I said, okay, I'll stay on with you. When they get there, let me talk to them and I'll tell them what's happening and what he's taken and what his history is.So anyway, long story short, they took him to a hospital on the south side of Indianapolis. I jumped into my car with eleven year old and this is so old. I had a bag phone, okay? This is 1996. Even that was not something everyone had.I had it because of the business that I needed to be able to be reached. Because we had these two stores. I went."

This is an important plot device for later, so I'm pointing it out now.So go. Cinderella is all set to go to this ball and she's practically unrecognizable, not really, but just to know everybody because nobody actually cares about her in her life. So she's unrecognizable at this point because she's happy and beautiful.

So you don't want that to happen in front of the prince.You want to make a good impression on this guy. And so Cinderella says, yeah, whatever. Bye. And goes off to the ball, drawn by her mice and dog in a pumpkin. And they get to the ball and she enters the grand entrance area.Foyer. Foyer. I don't know. She enters and all of a sudden the prince is struck by her radiant beauty and they dance. They danced all night and it's all very romantical and I don't think the prince asks her name, which is sketchy because you should generally not dance the night away with a guy you don't know the name of.Just a general rule, but I'm willing to let her have a pass on this because she was raised by Heathens, so she's having a great time dancing with the prince. Nobody recognizes her and all of a sudden the clock starts striking midnight and so she books it. She is trying to get to her carriage and get home before everything goes to crap because very godmother actually had some fair points there. And so she's running down the steps and heels, which is very, very hard, like I sympathize. And she loses the heel, which is fair, and she thinks about going back for it but doesn't really have time because she still needs to leg it to the carriage.And so she just leaves the heel on the steps, the glass slipper, and she gets to the carriage and they start driving off into the distance and they make it some distance before the spell ends. And she's left on the side of the road in rags, surrounded by mice and dogs and sitting on a dead pumpkin. And eventually she gets over her sadness. She makes her way home so that she can wallow in misery under a roof. And then she's just going about her business, trying to not make it seem like she actually went to this ball because her step family wouldn't really be about that.And all of a sudden the king's what did I say he was? Advisor. Let's call him an advisor. He's this guy with the monocle. He comes to the door and he says, we have this shoe that the prince will marry whoever foot this shoe fits.And the evil stepmother thinks to herself, this is swell. Things didn't go over so well last night, but if I can shove one of my daughter's feet into this shoe, we're home free. So she sneaks upstairs. This may have happened earlier. I don't remember.But she sneaks upstairs. She locks Cinderella in her room where she's wallowing in misery and then goes back downstairs. And there are all trying to put this shoe on their feet, but it's not working. Obviously they have huge feet because they're evil. And evil people have big feet.Everybody knows this."

However, while the mother and daughters are busy primping themselves and having a good time, she's left to work with the farm animals and gets to know them and takes care of them.She spends her time sometimes looking out of the window at the far off castle in the distance, wondering what life would be like in the big castle.Turning to the castle, the king is very upset because his son has not taken a bride and he brings his top advisor to develop a strategy to find a wife for his son because he doesn't want to die and relinquish his crown to his son. Without a wife to carry on the line, they decide to put an announcement out to all the families with eligible young women, a bulletin which ends up at the house of the wicked stepmother and her daughters. They read the notice, cinderella listens and finds out about it, goes up into the bedroom and moans and longs to put on a beautiful dress that she sees there. Wanting to go to the ball herself, the family gets ready and apparently they buy the sisters all stuff to get them up to go to the ball.

And all the rest of the people, all the rest of the women who were there with their families, settled to the back of the room, and they watched this beautiful young woman dance the most lovely dance with the handsome Prince. And then the prince said, I want to keep dancing with you all night. Which caused Cinderella to look at the clock. Now, the Fairy Godmother had told her, you can be At The Ball Until midnight, but at the Stroke Of twelve, you will again become Cinderella in Your Tattered clothes, and the coach will Once again become A pumpkin, and everything will go back to how it was.So Cinderella knew that, and she had forgotten. But now the clock started to tick. Bong. Bong, she said. Oh, to the prince.I'm so sorry, but I must go. No, said the prince. Don't leave. Yes. I have to go.Why? I can't tell you. And off she dashed, down out Of The ballroom, down the steps, and as she did, she fell, and the slippers Came Off of her. One of the glass slippers came off of her feet and landed on the stairs. But she kept running.And now she got into the coach. She Got into the coach, and off they went. And then, poof. She was back home, but she was herself again.

This was found by the prince and his courtier, the people who served him. And the prince said, Well, I have this slipper anyway. We will now go Throughout The kingdom, and we Will see on whose foot does the slipper fit.And so they went to the house of Cinderella and her family. But Cinderella Was locked in the room upstairs, so that there was no possible chance that she could come to have the slipper tried on her foot.And then the evil stepsisters tried to fit their big feet into the slipper.

        "transcript": "Cinderella grew up in a loving home and with her mother and father. Her father a merchant, her mother a duchess. I believe they were able to go through and have a wonderful family life. But at one point, her mother passed away. Her father went on a business trip where he was hit in the face with a statue and passed away as well.So coming back, he was supposed to bring her a small present, and that didn't happen. But he did bring back this wonderful stepmother and her two stepdaughters, brunhelda and Giselda. I think that's her name should have looked it up. So these two girls were incredibly spoiled bratz. But Cinderella gazelle, being the kind person that she was, wanted to make them feel happy at home and loved.She took care of them until her father passed away unexpectedly. She still took care of the family because her stepmother was the only mother that she ever knew. As time went on, there was to be a ball. The ball was to celebrate the prince and his engagement to the princess. He hadn't picked the princess.She was going to be decided at the ball. So when the ball came up, the stepdaughters were totally evil and destroyed the dress that Giselle, Cinderella, had made. Her dress was then taken care of by her fairy godmother. Her fairy godmother also turned the pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into footsmen, the lizards into chairman, and they were able to go to the ball. But she had to be home by midnight.It got too close to time, and because she was a slacker, she wasn't getting herself ready. A couple of minutes beforehand, she realized her ineptitude and started running down the stairs. She took to flight and losing to shoe in the process. She made it most of the way home, but most of the spells had disintegrated as she landed at her house. However, the glass slipper still survived, and the prince had his and she had hers.So when the prince decided to go and find his princess, he drove around town on his carriages or his horse made all of the elderly ladies try it on. But he got to her sister's house. Oldest sister couldn't fit, so she cut off her heel. That didn't work. The birds plucked her eyes out.Younger sister cut off her toe. That didn't work. The birds plucked her eyes out. Then she got to Cinderella. Giselle finally got to try on the shoe.It fit. She did offer a forgiveness for those other two sisters that rather than wandering through the woods blind and sullied in their foot, they would just have to wander the woods and no one would give them."

        "transcript": "Okay. Once there was a gentleman, and he lived with his wife, and they had a lovely little girl. But unfortunately, the wife died. And over the course of time, the man was lonely, and so he met another woman that he wanted to marry. And this woman had three daughters.He brought her to his home, and he introduced her to his daughter. And the three daughters and the mother were very, very richly dressed. And really, at that time, so was his daughter.As time went on and he married this woman and they were all living together, it became apparent that the mother, who, of course, was the stepmother of Cinderella, was favoring her daughters quite a bit more than she was the man's daughter. In fact, the man's daughter had to do so much work and ended up spending her nights by the fireplace instead of in bed. So she was covered with ashes from the fireplace. And so they started to mock her and calling her Cinderella. The stepsisters were unkind, mean, nasty, and basically made Cinderella's life very unpleasant.In the kingdom where this family lived was a king who had a son who was a very handsome prince. The son was not yet married and didn't haven't really found anybody that he was interested in marrying. And so the king decided to have a ball to introduce his son to all the ladies in the land so that he could find someone to marry, because the king was very anxious for his son to be married. So they sent out invitations to everyone in the whole kingdom. The invitation came to the house of our hero family, and they received the invitation, and everybody is ecstatic.And the stepdaughters go around no, sorry. The stepsisters go around and try to find all the most beautiful things to wear. And Cinderella, of course, is really wanting to go to the ball, too, but the stepsisters mock her and tell her that there's no place for someone like her at the ball. She will have to stay home, and while they wear all their beautiful clothes and go out to the ball, she's not happy about this, and she spends some time talking to her animal friends about how sad she is and how much she wishes she could go to the ball. So the evening of the ball comes, and the stepmother and the stepsisters I honestly don't know if the father went to the ball or not.He may have, but anyway, probably did. So they all left to go to the ball. And Cinderella is just feeling desperately sad and feeling so bad about not being able to go. And all of a sudden, she realizes there's somebody in the room with her there. And who is this person?Who are you? And the woman says, I am your fairy godmother, and I'm going to help you go to the ball. Well, of course, the girl's thrilled about that. And so the terry Godmother finds a pumpkin and changes the pumpkin into a coach."

        "transcript": "It. And the story is of a little boy, looks like he's about ten years old. He's playing soccer. In panel one, he shows that he's playing soccer. He kicks the ball with his right foot and presumably mistakenly puts it directly through the center of a large plate glass window.That's in panel two. It just so happens to be a gentleman who's sitting in a chair by the very window that the ball comes crashing through. The ball hits a lamp, knocks the lamp over toward the gentleman. He's clearly very surprised that this is happening. That's the end of panel three.And in panel four, he picks up the soccer ball and is looking out the window, clearly unhappy about what's happened in this story. There's a small boy. He's getting ready to go to school. His mom knows that there's a prediction for rain that day, and so she's encouraging him to take an umbrella along with him. But he says no, he really doesn't need to have an umbrella today and doesn't want to take it.On panel two, he says bye to his mother, big smile on his face. He's ready to go to school and start walking. Mom is still a little concerned that she's going to get rained on, but she holds the umbrella back in panel three, he's walking off to school. He gets partway there and starts to rain. The rain starts falling down as shown in panel four.The rain is coming down heavier now. Puddles are accumulating, and the little boy realizes he's going to get absolutely soaked by the time he gets to school unless he turns around and goes home. So he does that in panel five. He gets into the door. Mom is there.She's a little disappointed and a little concerned, possibly a little frustrated with him, but she is very patient. The boy is clearly unhappy himself. He must get changed up just a little bit, put some warm and dry clothing on, and then leaves the house. He's walking back to school, this time with an umbrella.Well, this picture shows a rescue personnel, some gentleman who has a red or orange vest on with some kind of belts which must be used to fasten him onto maybe to a line, to a wire that's a rope that's holding him onto the shore. He's coming out into a really turrent of a river, which probably occurred because of some flooding upstream, causing a flash flood. There's a young woman who is grasping onto a branch, and presumably she got washed down the stream, got caught up somehow. The rescue gentleman who's coming in to rescue her then is pulling himself down the limb to where the young woman is. At this point, it looks like he will be able to get to her safely and have his colleagues on the shore to pull them both to safety.Okay, in this story, Cinderella, it begins with Cinderella as a little girl. She's in the home of father. She has a little puppy dog who's her friend. Her father remarries to a woman who has two young girls of her own.And the story starts with that new family coming together."

Your volume went down again, but I can still hear you.Okay, well, okay. I was very sick. I thought I was going to die. Um, I had a UTI. I was living by myself, and I knew what I had, and I even had antibiotic, and it wasn't working.And I spent three days waiting for the antibiotic to work, each day getting worse. And my fever kept going up and I started puking. And I felt very close to death anyway, so I called my friend who gave me a different prescription. I don't know why I didn't go to the hospital, but I didn't I couldn't move anyway, so he brought over a new medication and it was the right one. And so I got better.And once you hit the right medication with the UTI, you just get better. You don't really do anything. You just keep resting, drinking a lot of water. And it was a very stressful time in my life.That was part of why it triggered the UTI. But anyway, so, yeah, I got the right antibiotic and recovered probably within four days was back to normal. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Oh, yeah. Okay, so if you could choose an instance and tell me what problems there were and what you did to communicate and did about the problems.Okay, well, I was very close to a person who had trouble expressing himself. I mean, we probably all have met men like that.Um, well, I probably shouldn't talk about this because I don't know if this qualifies for true. I think it's sh.Well, that's kind of what it was like talking with him. Someone who couldn't find the words like what I just went through, either did not know the words or he did not know himself. It was hard to say. It's hard to say. There would be extremely long pauses and then there would be inappropriate responses, or it'd be an inappropriate response, or it'd be a complete diversion so that whatever it was that was asked was not going to be answered.And I never could figure out if it was because they really didn't know, or they couldn't express themselves, or it made them feel too vulnerable. I don't know if I'm talking about the right thing, but."

So take your time to look through the picture, and then I'll take the book away for you to tell me the story in your own words.So tell me as much of the story as you can. You can use any details you know previously about the story as well as the pictures that you just viewed. There's a little girl named Little Red Riding Hood, and she lives in a little house with her parents in the woods. And her mom sends her through the woods with a basket of goodies to take over to her grandma. So she goes through the woods and she meets the animal friendly animals.And then she runs into the Big Bad Wolf, who scares her.

You take two slices of bread and you would lay them out on the table and get a butter knife and get out the peanut butter and the jelly. And you would scoop out some peanut butter and slather it over one slice of bread and then scoop out the jelly and put it on the other slice of bread and spread it all."

        "transcript": "About this.Okay, so in 1984, I applied and received a scholarship to do my master's degree at DePaul University in Greencastle, Indiana. And during the first week of having arrived, even before classes started, we were just orientation, et cetera, et cetera. I found out that the Pan Am Games were going to come to Indianapolis in 1987. So I immediately applied for a job with the Pan Am Games that took the whole duration of my master's degree to materialize. But eventually, in 86, I was appointed Vice President of International Relations with the Panam Games.And as such, I traveled extensively with the President of the Panam Games Organizing Committee, including a trip to Cuba to meet with Fidel Castro and convince him, or rather offer conditions that would satisfy him for Cuba to participate in the Pan Am Games in Indianapolis of 87th. That's the 10th Pan American Games. So essentially, we offered that the athletes would not have to receive a visa. Anybody who got on the plane came to the Games, that the plane would fly directly from Havana to Indianapolis, that they would get preferential area of the Pan American village to house their athletes, and finally, that the United States would lend every support it could to the organization of the 1991 Games in Havana. So those were the four conditions that the Cubans requested.We said yes to everything. Of course, the last one was, whatever is in our power to do, because we are not the Pan American sports organization who is ultimately the one that decides where the next Games are going to be played? And so Cuba agreed to participate. And I was the one person that got the call from the Olympic Committee in Cuba, from the Cuban Olympic Committee, confirming that they were going to participate. That was very thrilling because for a few minutes, I was the only one that knew that Cuba was going to participate in the Pan Am Games, which was a very sought after objective.It was whatever everybody wanted. And I was the only person in the organization that knew about it because I was acting as interpreter between the Cubans and the organizing committee in India. So that was a real drill. And the Cubans participated. And the Pan Am games went to Cuba in 1991.I was not a part of that. But then in 95, I met the Cubans again because they came as consultants to my participation in the Pan American Games in Argentina."

The baby splashed and chased the fish.Afterwards, Carl decided that he wanted to dance. Amazingly, Carl knew how to turn on the stereo and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music. And Carl danced and danced for the baby, and the baby laughed and clapped his hands.Afterwards, Carl and the baby were both very hungry, so they wandered into the kitchen. They got into the refrigerator and what did they find? Bread and butter. Carl got a package of whole wheat bread and he ripped it open and ate all the bread. Meanwhile, the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty, buttery taste.They found grapes and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth. They made chocolate milk with syrup. What a mess. You can imagine. There was syrup and milk all over the floor and what's in the red jar?Oh, my. There was food everywhere, and the baby was a mess.The baby climbed onto Carl's back and they climbed back up the stairs, leaving the mess behind. Carl, smart dog that he was, started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside. He got a washcloth, a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap, and he scrubbed the baby. Carl's mouth was full of soap and he made bubbles when he breathed, which made the baby laugh.Afterwards, Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry. He brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside. Then Carl had work to do. He went back down to the kitchen, finished off the bread, put the wrapper in the trash, licked up the milk. He looked out the window.Mom wasn't back yet. He still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time. He looked out the window and saw Mother coming home. The baby was laying in his crib quietly and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited. Mother walked in to see them just as she had left them.She was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter. Good dog, Carl, she said and rubbed his head while he put his head on her lap."

        "transcript": "Okay.The person that I had the most contact with like this, that was my mother. And she started to have memory issues back in 1995, where she would repeat what she had just said and without any awareness that she was repeating herself. And of course, at first, you don't really know how to deal with that. And I'm not sure, honestly, I'm not sure that I did this, but I think that I would say, yeah, mom, we decided on that a little while ago, and so we're going to do this. So I would tell her what we had decided when she brought it up the first time.So that gradually got worse. It was diagnosed by her doctor as vascular dementia. So she was having little tiny strokes that were knocking out connections in her brain. And the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright, real intelligent, and she would tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something. She would read in the paper that somebody had died and then talk about it and then later do the same thing.And then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before and so I didn't know it. She would she would make up reasons, logical reasons, why she hadn't known something. She also got really good at asking questions instead of asking other people to talk, instead of having them ask her questions because she knew she wasn't able to answer questions.So I think I'm not sure, but I think that this was some reading that I had done which said that with a person with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely no point in trying to help them to remember or for heaven's sake, make them feel bad about not remembering things. Because of course, there's a period of time in there when you realize when my mother was realizing that she was losing memory and it was horrible for her. She felt awful. And of course, after a while, it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore, and that's really better. At least it didn't hurt her so much.And I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what experience means, experiencing things when you can't remember them. Like we would go to plays and musicals and concerts, and this was when she was living with my aunt. And I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies, really, but musical things, concerts and musical theater. Mom would have no memory whatsoever of that the next day, but she loved it while it was happening.Just was delighted. She was always musical and this kind of stuff just pleased her no end. And so it was really interesting to think about what she what it means, what that means. Is it valuable? How valuable is it when you don't remember it?And I decided ultimately it was really valuable."

And I had three boys then, and the dog and a husband.And we played in the yard. When I was running with Heidi and just chasing her in, my left foot bent. I heard it crack, and it made a snapping sound. And I knew that was not a good thing to hear. So I went down on the ground, sat down immediately and got off my foot.I don't remember where Heidi went. The dog's name was Heidi, and she was there. But I got up the stairs because the yard stairs went into the backyard, going down the stairs. So I had to go up the stairs that my husband built this porch. It was a patio porch and with stairs, and we would sit out there and have our barbecue in that.So I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kind of dragging it. I would not step on the other foot that was broken. So we got upstairs, I went onto the couch, and I laid down, and it wasn't hurting. And when my middle son came home from school, he said, what happened to you? And I said, Well, I think I broke my foot because I heard this snappy noise while I was playing with Heidi.He said, well, you have ever get to the hospital? And I said, oh, no, I'm okay. I don't have to go to the hospital. He said, oh, yes, you do. He must have been in about fifth grade.You have to go to the hospital. No, I don't. And he says, well, I'm going next door to talk to Steve. His wife is a nurse. So he went and he told Steve, and Steve told his wife, the nurse, what happened.Since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do, he ran off to find out some other advice. So the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor. So then I called my husband, and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious. The nurse would know what to do. Not me or not my son, but obviously he did know what to do.So when I went to the doctor, they x rayed my foot. I had broken my fifth metatorsal, or think that's how you say it. And it's the bone that's on the side of your foot. So they x rayed it, and they saw that was broken."

And I just remember I was eight weeks pregnant.We had decided to tell both families that I was pregnant. We waited to tell them until eight weeks. And I was in California with my husband's family, and I stood up from a chair and I literally could hear and feel something pop. And I had a huge pain, more like a cramp. And then I don't know what happened, but the pain Was getting a lot worse.This isn't a happy story.Then that day, we went to a friend of his family's house and unbeknownst to me, I was getting a lot worse very quickly. But I didn't know I knew that there was something wrong. I did not feel good. I was getting lightheaded. I was feeling like I had to go to the bathroom all the time.And then we left their house and I was going to fly home with my year and a half year old daughter on the plane. And then Jim Was going to drive the car back. And I got to the airport and I couldn't walk very far. I just got real dizzy and lightheaded, and I'd have to sit down, put my head between my legs to get to where I could stand up and walk a little bit more. And we kept doing this.This was before we had security, though, so you could do all of this stuff and not worry too much about it. And he could walk me to the gate. And I got on the plane. I carried my daughter on the plane, got on the plane. I sat down on the plane, and I knew I was going to pass out, so I wanted to get to the bathroom, and I gave my daughter one of my Mother of the Year moments.I gave my daughter to a perfect stranger next to me and said, could you watch her for me, please? I have to go to the bathroom. I tried to get my head between my legs so that I could get some blood flowing back to my head so that I could be conscious, because I knew I was going to lose consciousness. I waited and waited and waited. I finally came out of the plane.I mean, out of the bathroom. I sat back down, I took Sarah, we landed. I knew I had to get out of the plane and walk and again before security sister was my parents were bringing my sister and she was meeting me at the gate to help me with Sarah, thank God.

So presumably the father disappears. Somehow he dies or something happens.He's removed from the family. The rest of the discussion kind of focuses on the story, focuses on the inner actions that happen there. As Cinderella is growing up her stepmother and the stepsisters abuse her and really use her as a servant for the family. Cinderella is a good hearted, good natured young woman. She takes it all in stride.Tries to do her best in her new place within this family. The stepmother and stepsisters really never develop any affinity for her. But Cinderella develops fondness for many animals, including her dog, but then also mice and other animals in the environment of her home. She happens to live very close by to the castle and sees the castle every day looking out the window and dreams of all the wonderful things that happen in that place. But it's clearly outside of her reach.One day, the chancellor and other staff within the castle decide that they have to have a ball because the young prince is at a point where he needs to select a bride to get married, to carry on the lineage of the royal family. And so they send out a notice to all of the families in town inviting, particularly inviting all of the young women who were of marriageable age to come to this ball and to dance with the prince and possibly ask for their hand in marriage. And so the stepmother is very excited and wants to one of her two biological daughters to be the one selected. And so begins with preparations for them to attend the ball. Meanwhile, Cinderella dreams of everything that could possibly be in going to this ball not even necessarily thinking about getting married to the prince but just what could it could be so wondrous but she knows she doesn't have clothing suitable for that or anything else.And in talking with her animal friends, they decide, in particular the mice decide, that they will make her a beautiful ball dress. And so they do. When it's time to leave with a ball, cinderella appears to a stepmother with her stepsisters dressed in this beautiful ball dress and ready to go.They are very angry that she would have the affrontery to actually think that she could go to the ball being just a poor wait staff at this point in her life. And so they destroy her dress and tear up her jewelry that was prepared for her and leave her crying and go off to the ball. At that point, Cinderella has a fairy godmother. And that's where the fairy godmother enters into the story. She talks with Cinderella.And Cinderella says, of course, that she does want to go up through the ball, but she hasn't. No way of getting there. No clothing suitable. And so Cinderella, the fairy godmother, creates a beautiful white ball dress for Cinderella."

So I guess you could say they were having a difficult time communicating since most everybody spoke English. But they spoke French and they were clearly having a tough time.So I went over, since I was quite fluent in French when I was much younger, I went and asked if I could help them in French. And the woman said, I don't remember the course of the conversation, but she did get to a point where I really could not understand what she was saying. And so I said to her in French that I was sorry. It had been a long time since I had studied and spoken French. And I was sorry, but my French wasn't very good.And she said to me, no, it's not. And that was the end of the conversation.Well, I'm going to tell you about having a grandson because that's probably the most important thing that's happened in recent years. We waited very long. My mother has a cousin I should go back and say my mother has a cousin who, at the age of 70, had her first and only grandchild. And this happened about 15 years ago. And I remember saying to my husband at the time, can you imagine being 70 years old and not having a grandson?Well, my first son got married, and after a year or two, they told us they weren't planning to have any children. Then my second son got married. And we waited, and we waited, and we waited. And I had kind of given up hope when they called one night and said, well, we're both on the phone. Mom put dad on the phone.Well, the last time one of my sons had asked to put dad on the phone was to tell us that he was getting divorced. So I wasn't so happy about that. So dad got on the phone, and now my son said, now there are five of us on the phone. I said, how five? Well, he said, Stephanie and me, and you undead in a baby.And it still didn't pench. I said, what baby? Because I had pretty much given up hope. So they told us they were having a baby. We were extremely excited.And the baby was born seven months later. And we are, of course, thrilled with him.Boy is outside the house practicing with the soccer ball, practicing his kicks, I guess. And he gets a really good kick going because he knocks it right through the window of the house, smashes the glass. Man is sitting inside the house. The ball comes in the window, knocks over a lamp, and then the man stands there and looks out the window, looking kind of surprised. I can't quite figure out if that's a dustbuster he's holding in his other hand or getting ready to clean up the mess, I can't really tell.Okay, little boy is getting ready to go to school. Mom hands him an umbrella, says, you're going to need this. It's going to rain. They go to the front door. He says, look, it's not raining.I don't need the umbrella. Leaves the house without the umbrella. Gets not too far from the house, and lo and behold, it starts raining. And he starts getting wet. Starts raining more heavily.He runs back home. Mom looks a little ticked off at him. He's wet. He's looking a little dismayed, but now he's on his way back to school with the umbrella.Well, it appears to me that these people were in some kind of a boat on a body of water, because the man is wearing a vest, a life vest. The girl, however, does not appear to be. Apparently there were some rapids or something, and for some reason they were thrown out of the boat. Boat overturned, don't know. They're thrown out of the board.They're now being swept down this waterway. The man grabs onto a branch that's hanging over the water, and the girl comes by, and he tries to get her to hang on also so that she doesn't get swept any further away."

And we're ready to eat. It's a day and the kids are outside playing and all of a sudden the cat crawls up in the tree. Little girl's all scared.So dad, he crawls up on a branch to try to get the cat and he's stuck the dogs at the bottom of the tree, barking. Little girl still screaming. And here comes a fireman running to save them all.And after they save them, it's all done. Everybody's happy. I was having a real hard time for a few nights, sleeping and breathing and I would set up a lot. And in the morning when I got up, my wife Angelist said that she had called a doctor and and made an appointment because I had been saying, no, no, there's nothing wrong, it's just my allergies. And she was tired of hearing me up all night.So not very happily I left, went to the doctor and actually the doctor practitioner. And she checked me out and she said she's leaving for a minute and came back with another doctor. And they said, well, you have congestive heart failure, we need to put you in the hospital. So I spent the next 30 days in the hospital being treated. It wow, that's it.That must have been scary. Were you ever situation where you were? Tell me about that story. Start from the beginning.I'll go back when our youngest was probably 1314 years old and it was wintertime and she had gone to a school dance with one of her friends and the two girls that left the house and headed for the dance. And we were just relaxing at home and the phone rang and said, this is the Valley Medical Center emergency room. We have your daughter here. And she was found in a snowbank and she's in hypothermia. We're trying to warm her up.At that moment, I just went totally faint, couldn't think of anything. And we went down."

Well, he refused. Is he's going to be very brave? Nothing's going to stop him.He doesn't need an umbrella. That's for sissies. Out he goes into the weather. It's raining. It's raining hard.It's raining so hard that he's stepping in puddles. He's getting soaked, his hair is dripping. He returns home, much to the conversation of his mom. Well, apparently he had a change of heart because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella. Tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can.Well, this is a Cinderella story, not Walt Disney's, that's for sure. Cinderella was a good girl, but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters and they were pampered, spoiled, and they were nasty. And Cinderella was called Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders, meaning she had to clean up the fireplace, she had to take out the cinders and do things like that. So it was pretty dirty. So happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party, a ball, a very happy one.And the two stepsisters, helped by the horrible stepmother, got invitations to go. Poor Cinderella thought she had to stay home. But because she had always been a good girl, a fairy godmother appeared out of nowhere and said to her look, you deserve to go. We could arrange this, but there are conditions. First of all, there will be a coach for you, pulled by horses.And there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers. And the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at the ball at the strike of twelve, you must be out of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin. Cinderella went to the ball. The prince could not take his eyes off her because she was so good and so beautiful and she had a wonderful time. But all of a sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve.She knew she had to get the heck out of there really fast. In so doing, she dropped one of her slippers. But it didn't make any difference. She got out. She got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home.Well, the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away, but that didn't matter because."

And she makes a dress with the animals help her. And then her stepsisters get mad, and they tear apart her dress, and they tell her that she can't go to the ball with them. And her sisters go off to the ball.And then Cinderella has a fairy godmother that gives her a beautiful dress and sends her off to the ball with glass slippers.

And her father she loved very much. And then he passed away and left her behind to be cared for by the stepmother and her two daughters. And she showed a lot of favoritism towards her own daughters and used Cinderella more as a servant or a housemaid than an actual stepchild. And Cinderella was made to sleep in quarters that were cold and damp while everybody else enjoyed the lavishness of the estate.And she had to do a lot of the menial work and be at everybody's beck and call. And really suffered a lot in that state and looked out her window frequently and saw the king's castle up on the hill and wondered what life would be like in different circumstances. And then at the same time, the king was very upset because his son, the prince, had not yet married and was coming to an age where he needed to be married to provide heirs for the kingdom. And so the king made a decree that there was going to be a ball and that all the young maidens of the kingdom were to be invited and that the son would have to select from those that attended someone to be his bride and to carry on the royal tradition. So invitations were sent out and the stepmother received an invitation and was excited for her two daughters to go and attend the ball, but concluded that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend the ball, that she wouldn't be eligible and she would be left behind.So Cinderella was extremely disappointed and upset by this and was locked away so that she couldn't attend while the others went. But in her distress, her fairy godmother showed up and granted her the opportunity to have a gorgeous gown and shoes and carriage and horse, which she took all of the animals, the mice and the cats and what have. You that were favorites of Cinderella and converted those into a fancy carriage and horses with a carriage master and so forth, that took Cinderella to the vault. And so she had the opportunity to go, but the only condition was that she had to be back home by midnight because everything would go back to normal and the whole facade would be revealed after midnight. So she went, she had a great time, she got the opportunity to meet the prince.They enjoyed some time together and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company during the course of the ball. Of course, the stepmother wanted her daughters to have that opportunity and was rather jealous over this girl that she didn't recognize as Cinderella at the time, but tried to force her way into having the prince recognize her daughters and everything. And so then when midnight rolled around. Cinderella had been having such a good time that she let the time get away from her. And at the very last second, she had to race from the castle to get in her carriage and make it home.And just barely made it."

        "transcript": "So I had my screening after all of my treatments, and I'm still in remission and it's 2020, so at least it's been that many years. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. So that's great, because now what I'd like for you do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situation, and I'm going to mute myself. Okay, well, I'll just say a person or this person.The difficulty in trying to communicate with this person is that this person lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time conveying that in words. And many times it turns into emotion or feeling, which can be anger, frustration, any of those sorts of things. But that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated, but on the outside, we have no idea because those words never came out.And so what I try to do is ask questions and see what kind of answers I can get to put together what the problem is, because it's much easier, in my opinion, to deal with those sorts of things as they come up, rather than waiting until someone is like a powder keg and just blows up. However, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate, because then their problem is, why are you asking all these questions? And then it's sort of like then you back off and you give the time to calm down, but then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because, say, in this situation, it's a work environment and I need answers and I need clear communication. So another thing that I have tried to do is I see one individual in our office who can communicate with this person, and so I take notes on how that person works with the other person, and I also use that person occasionally to help me understand and get information as well. I won't say that it's successful all of the time, but it is successful enough for me to get by.So asking questions, backing off as needed, feeling out the situation, and finding an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand what you already talked about might also fit this, but if you could choose something different to talk about in this case, that would be great. And it can be happy or sad. It can be from any point in your life, from child to now.So do you need a few moments to think about what you would oh, you know, okay, then I will mute myself and you may please tell me your story. Sure, it's one story, but it has two parts. The most important things to me are my two kids."

They came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father, her new stepmother and the stepmother's two daughters. Cinderella's stepsisters now didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful and they were mean to mother.The stepmother decided that Cinderella would be the maid, would be like a maid, and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work. She made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning, and she had to serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters.One day, an invitation came. The prince was having a ball and all the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball. The stepmother and the stepsisters were so excited, and they started planning right away for the ball. Cinderella was excited too, until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs. And the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of very long, difficult, dirty jobs, knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in order to go to the ball.Cinderella was so sad. She went in her room and cried and her animal friends gathered around her. She was friends with all the animals because she was so nice. The animals loved her. The animals helped her do her chores, and they all worked very hard.And they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball. When it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs. And when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress, they just went crazy with rage. And they tore the dress off of her and the pins out of her hair, and they pushed her down and told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball.Crying, she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her. And then fairy godmother appeared and took pity on Cinderella. With a wave of her wand, the fairy godmother produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen. And Cinderella looked beautiful. The stepmother or the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball, but she had to be back home by midnight because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were going to disappear and go back to normal.So she took some mice, and with a wave of her wand, she turned them into horses and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. Cinderella climbed in her beautiful gown and went to the ball. Everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom. And the prince fell in love immediately.

        "transcript": "Okay, see, other than being having babies and donating kidney, I did have numerous colds and ear infections when I was young, so about five when I was about five years old, it was determined that they were going to take my tonsils out. So they kind of told me what was going to be about and that I would have ratchet throat. And I can't remember everything because I was five years old. But I do remember waking up and my mom was there, and she was so comforting to me. Very difficult to swallow.So my throat was swollen and it hurt. This was a lot for a five year old. And my parents brought my Ken and Barbie doll and little doll house. I can play with that. While I was in the hospital bed.I remember them bringing me lime sherbet, and it was so good on my throat. I believe I was in the hospital about two days, and the recovery was fairly easy. It took me a while, maybe about four or five days before I could actually eat something that was truly solid. But that really did help with the colds because I didn't hardly have any colds at all. So there you go.Easy peasy. Before I give you the actual prompt, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. Any difficulty communicating? Okay, so then what I'd like is if you could tell me what the issues or problems are or were, as well as what you do about those issues.Okay, let's see. It was probably about six years ago. My best friend, her name is Sonny, we used to work together. And her husband, Stephen, tall guy, nice looking man. He started doing weird things like he left his glasses up in a tree.And then he was forgetting things, and then it actually got worse and worse. So about two years ago, she took him, Stephen, to the doctor. They ended up doing an Alzheimer's test on him. And sure enough, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. And watching Stephen go downhill, it's been so sad.To this day, he's still going downhill, and he's only 59 years old. When I do see him, he now talks in two word sentences, maybe three. Or you'll ask him a question and he just kind of looks at you. And sometimes you have to do your hands or kind of visualize something for him for him to understand.I think he's on medicine, but it doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often, I haven't been there since the virus. But I kind of just hug him and I just look in his eyes and just tell him, Hi, Steven. It's so good to see you. And he'll say, Good to see you, too.He doesn't remember my name. He remembers Sonny's name, but he knows that he knows me. But as far as what I would do to help him talk, there's not a whole lot I can do because his conversation skills are gone. They're just gone. But keeping it really simple for him, maybe ask a question that's maybe real easy for him to answer, that doesn't involve memory, like, how are you feeling today?You know, I like your pants, Stephen. Something like that. So that's about all I know that I could do to help him, is just keep it really simple."

Sitting doesn't do well for me.Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? And this can be any kind of difficulty communicating. We keep it kind of broad, but what I was hoping is that you could tell me what kinds of difficulties there were, what kinds of issues, and also what you did about it.I guess just learning as my mom gets older that her hearing is not as good. And I obviously have a little bit of an issue speaking up and I forget that she can't hear me. And we've tried different my brother's tried different hearing AIDS for her to see if that helps, and buying the headless speakers and stuff like that, it really doesn't help. So now I'm just really practicing trying to look at her when I talk, which has become a challenge if you have a face mask on, but looking at her and remembering that she can't hear me because I don't always think about it because I've known my mom's never been hard of hearing, and now she has a hard time hearing. I just have to remember to speak up.And often I don't remember that until I see her looking at me going, what are you saying?We're working on that one. Still, I would like you to tell me, thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Something that happened to you, could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to now? Just any important event that you could tell me a story about the day my granddaughter was born. My husband and myself live in Florida and our son and daughter in law lived live in Ohio and we happened to know that her due date was January 1 and we wouldn't be able to make it.So we went up early for Christmas and we were going to go visit them, but we stopped in Cleveland first and where my father in law lives and son in law, my son and daughter in law live in Columbus, so we were at my father in law's and my daughter had also flown in from Florida. She just got there the night before and we stayed up really late and then we woke up in the morning and we were going to go do stuff and we got a call that said her water broke and that the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car, drove two and a half hours to Columbus and made it there before the baby was born. Just waiting in the waiting room with her mother and her stepfather and then getting the text that the baby was born and that they'd be out in a little bit. So it was a very exciting day.We got to go see the baby. We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off. So once again, I'd like to show you these pictures. Take a little time and look at each one. And then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an it little boy.The teenage boy, it looks like, was playing in the field with a soccer ball, and he kicked it. Really?"

The birds were dancing, everything was coming back into order. She quickly swirled her wand around Cinderella and her gorgeous white gown appeared.Cinderella had never looked so beautiful before. How will I get to the ball? She asked. No worries at all, child. As they went outside, they saw a huge fat pumpkin sitting there and a bunch of rats scattering around.Cinderella looked at it doubtfully, but after seeing what a beautiful dress she had created, she was open to everything. The fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a beautiful white horse drawn carriage. Cinderella was absolutely shocked. You have to get off to the ball, she said. Time is wasted.You have to be back by midnight. If you don't come back by midnight, all the magic will disappear. Remembering this morning, Cinderella jumped into the carriage and she was off to the falls. When she arrived, she was unsure what to expect. She had never left the castle before.Her dark and dreary life had never been opened up in this way before. When she walked inside and saw the beautiful dresses and the shiny earrings and the beautiful chandeliers as she was going towards the ballroom dance floor. The prince himself was so humbled by her grace and by her beauty and by her wonder. He immediately asked her to dance and they saw the joy, the authenticity in each other and danced the night away.Right before midnight, Cinderella heard the clock strike and she knew it was time for her to go. She had been so lost in this happiness and this dream that she completely lost track of time. She ran out of the palace as fast as she could, leaving a slipper behind on the step. Against his pleas for her to stay and to know her name. She ran off.Knowing what her destiny was going to be. She hopped in the carriage and his at home as it stumbled and turned back into a pumpkin and the beautiful galley at horses.She got back to her house just in time to safely go back up to her room in her rags, with a pumpkin being a pumpkin and rats being rats. But she had a new sense of mind, a new sense of wonder. She was no longer just the maid, she was no longer anybody else's peasant. She was her own princess, she was her own unity. With a little bit of magic and with a little bit of hope, she knew that she could be more than what she thought she was before.She went the next couple of days, being totally at peace as the sisters demanded, things didn't faze her. As they asked for things, she obliged.And then one day there was a knock on the door and it was an official in the castle. They announced that they were going around to every house, having every maiden try on the slipper until they could find what was the maiden.As he entered, the sisters pushed and pulled and fought their way to the front so that they could be the first to try the shoe on. Demanding that they have the prince's full attention, they tried to fit their feet into the slippery, but it was too small and it was too delicate. Flinging it around between the two of them, the man decided that they were certainly not the woman. Cinderella appeared around the corner, and one of the attendants noticed her. Is this another young woman that lives in the no, no.They tried to block her and cover her from sight. She's no one."

So they decided to host a great ball, where all of the women of the kingdom would come and dance with the prince, and he would have his pick to two choose from. Well, an invitation went out to all of the young women of the kingdom, and an invitation went to the home of this woman and her two daughters and her stepdaughter. She read the invitation aloud, and the three girls were so excited about it. Well, Cinderella went off to her room.She opened up her trunk, where she had an old dress, and she and her little animal friends found ways to add ribbons and things to the dress to make it presentable for the ball. Her sisters, at the same time, were trying to make dresses for themselves. And when they saw the very pretty dress that Cinderella had made, they ripped off the ribbons, and they ripped off the beads and the necklace that she was wearing, and they put them on their own dresses and ribbons until Cinderella was left with nothing presentable to wear to the ball. And the stepsister said that she was not going to the ball. So off the stepsisters went to the ball.That night, Cinderella was left at home. She was out in the garden, crying, when all of a sudden, her fairy godmother appeared to her, and the Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand. She turned the mice into horses. She turned the pumpkin in the garden into a carriage. So suddenly, Cinderella had a way to get to the ball, but she had no dress.And the Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand until Cinderella's ragged dress turned into a beautiful ball gown. Off she went. But before she headed off to the ball, the Fairy Godmother warned her that at midnight, she must be out of the castle, because her dress would return to rags. The carriage would return to a pumpkin, the horses would return to the mice that they once were. Cinderella then went off to the ball.When she arrived, all of a sudden, the prince saw a completely new person enter. She was more beautiful, more lovely than all of the other women who were at the ball. His eye went directly to Cinderella, and he asked her to dance. They danced and danced. He danced with no other woman the rest of the night, and the two stepsisters didn't even recognize that this was Cinderella.But suddenly, the clock struck midnight. Cinderella gasped as she ran out of the castle. The prince called for her. He didn't even know her name. But she ran out of the castle, down the steps, when suddenly her dress returned to rags and the carriage returned to a pumpkin.The horses became mice once again. The only thing she had left was one of the slippers, because it had fallen off. She picked it up. Well, she went home and within a few days, the Prince said he had to find the Princess. And he saw that there was this slipper, the other slipper glass that was on the step, and he said this was it.This slipper belonged to that beautiful woman. If we could only find this woman, she would be my."

As time goes on, the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls. And she is very cruel to Cinderella. She uses her as a servant and she has her do the cooking and the cleaning. When the mother arrived, she brought her Cheshire cat along.And the cat had the rule of the house, where the other animals were not treated as well. But Cinderella loved them all and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice, and they all loved her. As she was cleaning, she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle. In the castle there was a wonderful prince, handsome, charming prince, who was approaching the age to be married. And the prince's servants and the king said that he had to choose himself a wife.And so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball. And at that ball, all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time. Well, the stepmother got the invitation. She only considered her daughters and she didn't consider Cinderella at all. So she got her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelry, and they were ugly stepsisters.And Cinderella made her own dress. And with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals, she made a beautiful little dress. And when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters, ripped it to pieces and shredded and said that she is not going to go to the ball, that they are going to go to the ball, but she is not. So she was put into locked into a room and she was visited by the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the ball.So the fairy godmother, with her magic bobbity boo, made sure that she had a very beautiful gown. And out of a pumpkin she made a carriage, and out of the mice she made horsemen, horses to carry the carriage to the palace. And she was dressed in the most beautiful woman in the in the land. But she did have a stipulation. She said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear.So she went to the ball and she was the bell of the ball. And she caught the eye of the prince. And the prince fell in love with her, much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters. So she danced the night away. And then as she looked at the clock, she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes.And she knew that she had to run home or the magic of the night would disappear at that time. So she ran from the prince, and as she did, one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps and she ran and she ran. And then eventually, when she got into her carriage, the whole thing started to disappear. The magic of the night. The pumpkin returned to its former self and the animals were no longer horses.And everything returned to herself, to what they were."

And there the pumpkin had been turned into a beautiful carriage. And the little mice became her footman, and the dog was there as her special servant. And the horse excuse me, the horse.Suddenly there were six horses, and all of them were attired and beautiful plumage. And they became the horses that would draw the golden pumpkin carriage. So the fairy godmother helped Cinderella to climb up into the carriage, and off they went to the ball. Once they got there, the Meyer Domo I'm not sure what to call him but the man who welcomed the guests said, oh, who are you? And brought Cinderella up into the ballroom.And when the prince saw her come in, he dropped his attention to the stepsisters and all the other women in the room. And he was suddenly struck with awe at this gorgeous creature that had come into the room. And immediately he went over to her and he said, may I have this dance? And then for the rest of the ball, the prince danced only with Cinderella. But then there was a big clock in the room because Cinderella had been told by her stepmother that she could go to the ball, but she must come home by 12:00 because at 12:00 she would go back to being her old self, Cinderella, the one who dusted the fireplace.And now she suddenly looked at the clock, and it was two minutes before 12:00. And she said to the prince, oh, I'm so sorry, but I have to go. No, he said, don't leave. And she said, I'm sorry, I have to. And with that, she broke away from him and she ran out of the out of the castle, the palace, down the steps.But as she did, she lost one of her glass slippers that had been given to her by the fairy godmother. And the Meyer Domo, who was in charge of the guests, ran after her and said, no, wait. Come back. Come back. She said, no, I can't.But she had lost her glass slipper. But he found it and he took it. Cinderella got into her carriage, but suddenly, once again, she was just Cinderella. And the horses were just that one horse. And the dog was just the dog.He was no longer the footman, and the little mice were just little mice again.But who was that beautiful creature? Thought the prince. I must find her. And so he sent his emissaries out into the village. He had the glass slipper, and he sent his servant, who carried the glass slipper on a pillow.And they went to the houses of all the young women in the land, and they finally got to the home of Cinderella. But Cinderella was locked inside a door up high in her room.But then the footmen said, let me try the glass slipper on your daughters. And they were all excited, and they stuck out their feet, but their feet were too big for the glass slipper. And this was the last family in the whole village that the footman had. And his servant had come to. And they said, is there not one more person?"

And Cinderella got an invite. All her sisters were laughing at her. Her mother was laughing at her, saying that you're not going. You're not allowed to go.You must stay behind and clean the house.

But then one day she finds out about a ball that's being held by a prince in the neighboring village, and she dresses up for that.But then her stepsisters tear her dress.Somehow her fairy godmother gets there. I think her fairy godmother just kind of appears. She doesn't really summon her in any way and gives her a really nice dress and the glass slippers carriage and all that. She goes to the ball with that, addresses dances with the prince. But one of the stipulations her fairy godmother gave her was that it would all end at midnight.So it's like 1145. And she rushes out to leave and go back to her home, and one of her slippers falls off. But she just leaves it there.So she gets back home, I guess. Doesn't really think much of it, but the prince who really liked her finds the slipper and decides to have all the women in the area try the slipper on to see which one fits.Cinderella. She's, like, friends with all the animals in her castle. She just helps them out and they tell her about that or something. Like maybe summon the prince there.So the Prince comes to her castle and puts the slipper on her foot, realizes she was the girl. And then they get married and live happily ever after. All right, great. And then last I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Okay.You just get two slices of bread, peanut butter and jelly. You undo the jar for the peanut butter, take a knife and get a scoop of it. Spread that on one of the pieces of bread and make it even. Then you undo the jar of jelly, take a spoon, get a scoop of that, get a scoop or two, depending on how much you need. Put that on the other piece of bread on the flat, even surface and use the back of the spoon to spread it around.And then you put the part of the one bread that has the peanut butter on it on top of the part of the other slice of bread that has the jelly on it. And then you can cut off the crust if you want. Or cut it in half, but."

So my wife ended up driving the whole ended up being close to 3000 miles once we were back from that trip. Including including going to Oak Ridge Lab in Tennessee.And it was strange, gradually getting more motion and gradually getting more strength back than it was an odd experience.Thank you for sharing.Now, can you tell me of an experience that you've had with someone who has had a difficult time communicating, hating?Hmm, interesting question.Well, the only the only experiences of that sort of thing were most recently in 2018. In 2018, 1st in February, my mother in law, who at that point was living at a care center in Bloomington, gradually lost the ability to communicate very well because of health problems. Were just reaching a point where she wasn't conscious a lot of the time and when she was wasn't communicating very well. And she died in February of that year. And then my father in law in Gainesville, Florida, we were there in January and he was doing pretty well, but in March he was in the hospital, but communicating fairly well, but having some issues, but was much improved when we came back here.But then he had a downturn and died in April. And then when we were in Philadelphia in May of that year, my mother had some serious decline in health. And when the whole family was at her room in intensive care in Philadelphia, there were times when you could talk to her and she would notice, and other times that she didn't. And then sometimes she'd be talkative and make sense, and other times not."

        "transcript": "Okay. The little girl's pet cat climbed very high into a tree and she was so upset, she had been cycling around and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree, and she called her father to climb the tree to help to get the cat down. The dog was barking at the base of the tree. The mother, in mean time, had obviously called the fire brigade to get dad down out of the tree. And that's the end of the story.As I see it.We were living in La. And we lost our house in an earthquake, and at the gridge time we decided to move to Arizona. Shortly after we arrived in Arizona, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me because I knew no one here, I have no friends. Luckily, I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me and put me on a drug which I had to take called Tamoxapin.I live in the lakes in Tempe, which is a very pleasant place to live. And over the years, over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication, I got to know very many friends who were extremely good, very supportive to me. And I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time, and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And up till now, touchwood. There is no recurrence of it.I can remember when I first I worked for the BBC. I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney, Australia. And when I left with my German husband, when I left Australia to come back to Germany, my gift of the German language was not very large. And I already had one child who was born in Australia. And I realized that Germany was going to be my future home, and I had to do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could, which wasn't very easy because I had a sister in law who was not very kind at that time.And every time I made a mistake in Germany, she used to laugh and make fun of me. And I used to be very resentful about that, but because I was, I guess, so ambitious at that time, and because I was good at dialects and I think this has something to do with musical ability because I'm able to hear how a language sounds. I learned I had a good working knowledge of German. In about a year, I would say. That's all I can say about language difficulties.Very much so. I was four years old when the Second World War started, and I was living in Cardiff that time, which is the capital of Wales, and we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit. And my parents had decided to send me to live with my grandparents, who lived closer to the coast in Wales. And about two days before I was due to depart to live with my grandparents, our house was flattened. Luckily, we were in the garden at that time in what they call an Anderson shelter, and we heard, obviously, what was going on outside."

        "transcript": "Okay. Once upon a time, there was a woman who had two daughters. She married a man who had a daughter of his own. And when they came to live together, the two daughters of the woman were very, very unkind and were not happy about having this other girl come live with them. So, in fact, they made her do all the work and all of the chores.This other girl, the new daughter of the husband, her name was Cinderella, and they made her do lots and lots of work. She was very, very kind, however, to the animals, because they were really the only friends she had. Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace. And what was happening in the palace at the time was that the prince was time for the prince to be married. And so his father was saying that he needed to decide who he was going to marry.So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village. So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family. Her stepmother received the invitation, and her stepmother told her daughters about it, who got very excited. But they didn't really say anything to Cinderella. And the daughters started preparing their dresses and getting things ready for the ball, but they were not going to give a dress to Cinderella.So she went into her treasure chest. She opened up a book and had some old fabric in it, and she looked at that and decided to make herself a dress for the ball. But then when the time came for the sisters to all go to the ball, they said, oh, you need to fix my dress, and you need to fix my dress. And they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs. And before long, she had nothing to wear to the ball, and they were not going to have her go with them.So off the sisters went. Cinderella was so sad. She went out into the garden, and there she happened to see a pumpkin and the mice. And pretty soon, a fairy godmother appeared. And the fairy godmother said to Cinderella some magical words, and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage.She turned the mice into horsemen or something, or horses, and she turned Cinderella ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown. Cinderella went to the ball, but the fairy godmother said, you must leave by midnight, because then the coach will become a pumpkin and your dress will turn back to rags. Cinderella walked into the ball and the prince, and she began to dance. But at midnight, the clock struck, and she knew she had to leave. So she ran out of the castle.She ran down the steps, and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers. She ran and ran into the fields until indeed, her dress returned to rags. And the coach turned it back into a pumpkin. And one of the mice had a key for some. Oh, I know, because I guess they locked her up or something.I can't remember what was going on in that picture. But the mice unlocked the key. Oh, yeah, because the prince was coming to see whose foot fit that glass slipper. Because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry. And when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe.They tried the shoe on the two sisters, and it didn't fit. But Cinderella was locked up. But the mice found the key unlocked Cinderella's room, so she came running own. She tried on the slipper. It fit.And then the prince knew that she was the one he wanted to marry. They married and lived, as all fairies tales say, happily ever."

        "transcript": "Okay. Just very recently, I think it was January the 13th when the earthquake hit Haiti.It just so happened that one of my sons went down there the day before. The day before the earthquake, he went down to see if he could help people because he had heard and read how bad of things were people. So it so happened he on the plane down there for no special reason. There was one fella on the plane, changed his seat to another seat, and then my son wanted to move also. I don't remember why.I don't know why he wanted to move, but he wanted to move. So he sat next to this first fellow who moved. He sat next to him. Well, they struck up conversation, and this other fellow happened to be a pastor down in Haiti, so he became acquainted, and my son was down there to look to help people. And so pastor said the next day that he wanted to take him around and show him around the countryside, which he did.And on the way back to my son's hotel, hotel Montana, the earthquake struck, and my son wanted to go right on back to the hotel, backing up a little bit, but the pastor wanted to take him off to another spot and show him another area or church or something. They looked at some churches. And so for that reason, my son was not in the hotel when the earthquake hit. Otherwise he would have been killed because that hotel was flattened, as we all know, the Montana.But my son said the truck started shaking and bouncing and bouncing around on the road, and they realized the road was kind of on a mountainside. So anyway, they finally, I think, got back into Port Prince there and saw what had happened, and it was horrible. And they tried to help people and do what they could do, but there wasn't much they could do with just their hands. They had no tools or anything. Well, everybody knows the story, how bad it was and how bad it got.It tried to help people, and it tried to encourage them. Hang in there. Hang in there. Got dark. It was pitch dark.There was no lights of any kind.They did what they could do. The next morning, these people were dead. They tried to hang in there, encourage. So they prayed with people, and they carried people down the road to the medical where people were trying to take care of them, and it was just horrible. Well, in the meantime, I hadn't heard from my son, but I knew he was there.So from time the earthquake hit 05:00."

And when he took the cast off, my leg was just like it was bone. I had no muscle. And my leg has always been a different size to this day. It's kind of funny, but yeah, I walked and I ran, and I've done marathons.Well, I did one marathon.That's an exaggeration. And when I did it, I said, I am never doing this again. I was in such utter pain. But anyway, and now I can't run, and I have bad arthritis in it, and it has changed my life. Just breaking my ankle.It took a long time to recover. And about 1995, I had to stop running completely because I love the run and can't run, and I can't hike long distances like I used to hike all the time.A backpack is a good 30 to 60 pounds if you're going to hike for a couple of days. Can't do that. Had to limit myself to things that I do biking now.Yeah, it was just a belief that I was going to get better and a determination that I would get better that I think helped me more than anything.That's about it. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? I believe if so, I believe that the answer is probably yes. Could you please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it?Okay, well, problems communicating is vast.So the person I'm thinking of doesn't have any kind of speech impediment, and this is a different person than the other person.But I'll be brief. So this person doesn't express themselves all the time. We can have extremely awkward conversations, and then other times it goes well. So I've learned a couple of things. One is that help me communicate with this person.One is don't ask questions because they don't like questions. And the other is to get them at the right time of day.Or if he calls me, he usually will have something to say. But if I really feel like I need to talk to him, I know not to call him in the morning, and I know to hang up if he's busy and he'll tell me. So those are the two things I've learned, is don't ask a lot of questions. This is a mother and son.Don't ask a lot of questions and get him at the right time."

And her Cinderella's father married lady Tremaine is their name in the book, and she is the evil stepmother. She also had two daughters. I think their names are Anastasia and Drizella. And then Cinderella's dad dies, and Cinderella is left with her stepmother and her stepsisters.And so Cinderella's life pretty much consists of doing a lot of chores and taking care of her stepsiblings and her stepsisters and their mother. And she sort of dreams about being in a happier place because she's not treated very well, and she has to do all the work, and they don't have oh, but she has lots of friends with the animals that are around the house. So there's a horse that she's friends with, and a dog and mice and birds. But she's not friends with the cat, whose name is Lucifer, which I can't understand because cats are great, but she one day, an invitation to all the women, eligible women in the kingdom arrives to attend a ball for the prince, who is being pressured to get married by his father and advisors. So they're hosting a ball for all the eligible women in the kingdom, and the stepsisters are really excited and Lady Tremaine is really excited at the prospect of their daughters being the princess.And Cinderella, as an eligible woman, actually should get to go. And they're like, oh, yes, if you get all of your work done, you can go, I guess. So Cinderella makes plans to wear her mother's gown, and her animal friends thinks it would be really nice to sort of upgrade perma's dress by adding ribbon and beads and things to kind of work the ensemble accessorize. Basically, Cinderella works really hard, and meanwhile, her animal friends are making her dress better, and she gets done. And then she sees her dress, and she's very happy.And she gets ready to go to the ball, and her stepsisters stop her, and they snatch off her necklace, and they tear the sash from her dress and basically leave her dress in ruins. And so she couldn't go to the ball that way. And so she's out in the garden crying, and her animal friends are really sad because she doesn't get to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother comes, and the fairy godmother arrives and helps her come up with a way to go to the ball. And she starts by making a pumpkin into a carriage and turning the animal friends into different a driver, a horseman.And she turns the mice into horses and the horse into a man, which doesn't make sense, but she makes the how to get there work first, and then she she's about to send Cinderella off, and Cinderella's like, I can't go like this. And so mother needed to be redirected to help her with her dress."

And the mother was hesitant, but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella.And the boy was walking to school and it started to rain. And the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did. And so he ran back home as the rain got harder, splashing in the puddles and Wetley came in the door, saying nothing but showing his mother that she was indeed right. The mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella is really the best thing for his health and well being. So she gave it to him.And he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love. The end.Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella. I guess. There was a little girl, and her father was widowed, and so he remarried. And the new stepmother had two daughters the girl's age and the stepmother was not very nice. And as the dad got out of the picture, by an unfortunate series of events, the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave and turned her into basically a celery maid and made her clean out the fireplace.Which is why she's actually called Cinderella. So I don't know what her name was before. And one day a message came from the castle and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife. And Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress. And let's just call her the wicked stepmother.The wicked stepmother was not interested in letting Cinderella go. So when Cinderella came downstairs, she instigated a jealousy war with her daughters. And did I mention that mice and birds made her dress actually not Cinderella? She didn't do that at all. And they had taken things from the sisters.So the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was very sad. But the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle. And as Cinderella cried in the garden, her rather plump fairy godmother came and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown, turned the mice into coachmen and horses and turned a pumpkin into a coach. And Cinderella went to the castle.The prince fell madly and instantly in love with her. What are the chances? And as the fairy godmother had indicated to her, at midnight the magic would wear off."

And as she got older, more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden of being a rich daughter fell upon her and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them.It wasn't a happy life. One day, prince in the land came of age and needed to get married. And so the king said, Prince, we're going to have a ball so that you can meet some ladies to be married. An invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball and she was happy. And so she went to get ready for the ball.And Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as well, but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done, which was kind of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear. So the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house, including things that belonged to other people, and she slaved away the day. And so eventually it was time to go to the ball. And Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready. The stepsisters and the mother were happy, but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made and she was excited because then she could go to the ball.So she ran down the stairs to leave. And the sisters, seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them, tore her dress apart so she wasn't able to go in shambles. And while the stepmother sat and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball, while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince. And as she was crying, her fairy godmother appeared, introduced herself and said that she could go to the balm and that she would help her out. So they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman, and pumpkin into a coach and big beautiful dress and she was all ready to go to the ball.And so she headed off and the prince danced with a few people, but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and no one else really. He was very the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight, everything would go back to Norma and so Cinderella lost track of time and was about to strike midnight. She realized what would happen, and so she ran. And as she was running, she lost one of her slippers. The prince was chasing after her, trying to find out who she was.She was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear."

Dan all right, again, these pictures tell a story. Take a minute to look at them, and then when you're ready, please tell me what story you see with a middle and an end. One day, a little boy was getting ready to go to school, and his mom said, it's going to rain today. You'd better take an umbrella.And the little boy said, no, I don't want an umbrella. Bye, mom. He went out the door and started to walk to school, but halfway there, it started to rain. It started sprinkling just at first, and then it started raining harder and harder. So he ran home soaking wet, and his mom said, I told you so.And then he took the umbrella and he went back to school. The end.All right, and I think this is actually our last one, so whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see in this picture with the beginning, a middle, and an end. Once upon a time, a little girl was playing outside, riding her tricycle with her cat and her dog. And her cat got away from her and ran up and got stuck in a tree. So she called for her dad because the cat was stuck in the tree. So her dad went and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree to try to go get the cat.But the cat got scared and ran out on a tiny little branch, and the dad couldn't reach it. And when he was trying to move, the ladder fell over and he couldn't get down. At that time, the girl's dog went crazy and started barking at the dad and the cat in the tree. So they had to call 911, and the firemen came with their ladder, and they saved the day. They got the dad down, they got the cat down, and everybody was happy.The end. All right, so remember with Cinderella, I'm going to show you the picture book. They automatically move forward after 30 seconds. However, I can move forward if you're ready before then, and we can go back and review any of them after we finish going through the book, and then I'll take it away and ask you to tell me the story, okay?All okay.Anything you want to review? Nope. All right. So whenever you are ready, go ahead and tell me the story of Cinderella. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and she lived alone with her dad in the little village because her mother had died when she was young.One day, her dad decided that he needed to get married again so that she would have a mother. So he met and he married a widow that had two small girls of her own. And all things seemed good at first she was kind of mean. But she was okay until Cinderella's dad died. And then the stepmother got very, very mean.And her daughters were very, very mean also. They made Cinderella do everything around."

        "transcript": "So then we started pursuing the adoption route. And very interesting, I'd never thought how complicated it was to do that, and all that goes into that. And it was a long process and probably took close to a year. We went through a domestic adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute. So that was kind of heartbreaking at the time.And then finally adopted my daughter when she was about two months old. So we always say we were just waiting for her. And of course, she always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her and we didn't have any choice with him. He's just what we got. So I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because I gave birth to a child and also I adopted a child.I think it gave me interesting insight to both sides of it, and there are certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well. But a lot of people say, oh, I could never adopt. It wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah, she's my child just like my son is. There's no difference between them.And she's interesting too, because she says that she wants to adopt when she's ready to start a family, that she would like to adopt a child from the foster system. So I think that's kind of interesting, her perspective on that. All right, same idea here. Take a look at these pictures. They also tell a story.I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And again, you can look up the pictures as you tell the story. The little boy was playing soccer in his yard, and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard, and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room, and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp. The dad stood up, got the ball, and looked out the window and glared at his little boy.These pictures tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end, and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.So the little boy was getting ready to go to school, and his mother said, Johnny, you need to take an umbrella. It's going to rain today. And he said, mom, it's not raining. I don't need an umbrella. And he left.And sure enough, as he got halfway to school, it started raining, and then it started raining harder. So he turned around and he went back home and he told his mom, you were right, it started raining. And she was not very happy with him. And so he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school. So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture, and then tell me a story about what you see.Ideally, a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. So the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard, and she was playing with her cat and her dog. And all of a sudden, the dog chased the cat up the tree. And so she was very upset, and she called for her dad and she said, dad, Sparky has chased Peanut up the tree.And so the dad said, well, let me see if I can go get the cat. So Sparky's still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree. Dad climbed up the tree, but he couldn't reach the cat. The cat scared to death."

But she always dreamed of being a princess, the castle.And so, conveniently, the king wanted the prince to be married and made the Duke in charge of it, or the general, I think it was the Duke, if I recall.And he made him in charge of getting the son to be married. So decided to put on a ball. So the invitations are sent out, and Cinderella gets one as well do the evil stepsisters, and the stepsisters are going to go, and Cinderella asks if she can go, and the stepmother says that she can, but she has to do all of her chores and find a dress. So Cinderella's animal friends make her dress the birds and mice.And then when she gets all presentable and she goes downstairs to leave, they tear her dress up and tell her that she can't go. And so then they leave, and she's very sad. And her fairy godmother shows up out of nowhere and says that she'll give her all the things that she needs. But it expires at midnight, the blessing. And so Cinderella gets a nice dress and the carriage and the mice are turned into her guards or whatever, and she's brought to the castle and to the ball.And the prince immediately rushes to her, much to the hatred of the stepsisters and mother, and they have a good time, and they fall in love. But it hits midnight, and so all of her stuff starts disintegrating. And the advisor to the prince, the general or Duke or whatever his name was, chases after her, but she gets away. But she drops a slipper, one of her shoes, and everything else goes away except for her shoes. And so she's left with one, and they have one.And so the prince says that he wants to, and she goes back home, and the prince says that he wants to find her, so he decides to try the shoe on every woman. And so eventually, at some point, he gets to their house, and the stepsisters can't fit in it, and the stepmother doesn't fit in it, so they try Cinderella, and it's a perfect fit, and it's a match made in heaven and happy ending. All right. Awesome. Okay.And then one more story. It's a little bit different. I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I have never made one before. Okay.

And the stepsisters were very mean also, and I think called her names and made her do all their chores as well.And so she made friends with all the animals because she was lonely. And then and then an announcement came. Someone came to the door and announced that there was going to be a ball. And so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball. And since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters, the mother didn't want her to go because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince.So she locked Cinderella in the tower and they went to the ball. And so the animals made well, this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress. And it was real pretty and that's what infuriated the stepmother. And she tore up the dress and then locked her in the room. And then Cinderella was crying.And then the very godmother came and let her out of the room and with the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers and fixed her hair all up nice and turned a pumpkin into a coach, turned mice into white horses and the dog into a coachman. And so she was able to go to the ball and she met the prince, danced with him, and the very godmother told her that she had to leave by midnight or everything would return as it was. And so she was dancing with the Prince, and the clock started to strike midnight, and she said, I have to go. And he didn't want her to leave, but she started to run away and she lost one of the glass slippers and she ran and ran and got back in the coach and they started going down the road. And then everything, when the clock struck twelve, turned back to the way it was.And she was very sad, but she had a good time and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers. And so she went home and then the next day, and the prince really liked her and he had this glass slipper, so so he sent out a decree to find this woman with the glass slipper."

So she asked the huntsman to go and find Snow White and kill her.And Snow White, I don't know what she did. I guess she just kind of looked in the forest. She played with animals and stuff, and she was dreaming of finding her Prince Charming. And I think she might have found some or not first. But anyways, a huntsman came to find her, so she ran away.She ran into the Dark Forest and she ended up at this house. And she really liked the house. And she fell asleep in bed, and she woke up to seven dwarfs around her. But she got along with them, and they all lived together."

About six.I travel a fair amount for my job. At least I used to. Not going anywhere right now, but she grew up with the Disney princesses.She loved Disney movies when she was really little, like two or three. And this is probably a testament to bad parenting. We had to stop letting her watch Mary Poppins and Bed knobs and Broomsticks because she was developing a British accent. And so that was kind of problematic for us. And we had to kind of dial back that frequency with which she was watching those movies, but that's how much she was really into Disney.So we got up early one morning, and we told her, driving me to the airport because I got to fly out for work. And then when we got to the airport, when we turned around, we're like, that's not really what's happening. We're getting on it. You were all packed. We're going to Disney World.And I was so excited to see her reaction, and she did not react at all. It was like what? And then we repeated it, and it was like we kind of thought, well, maybe when it sinks in, she'll be like, really excited now. She's like, oh, okay. And that was it.That was as much reaction as we got from this uber Disney child with a surprise visit to Disney.It was a memorable reaction fail, but I enjoyed it anyway. Same thing here. Take time to look at these pictures that tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story with the beginning, a middle, and the end, and you can look at these pictures while you tell the story.

And when I was in graduate school, I was working on the venation of fly wings, and I was working with the pupil wings so that as they were in the pupil case, the wings were averted. And instead of having this bag of air out here, it was back in the body and inside up. So I had pipettes and would try to blow air into them to get them to turn in the right direction. And because that was long ago, there was not equipment available.So my dad made me some forceps, quite long handles, like a paintbrush, and he took copper strips and made the spring so that I had this bite on this long handle and could handle the specimen on the microscope. Had a very good microscope, because university and the specimens I had, I grew my own. And down in the part of the laboratory where the men working on the insecticides grew their cockroaches, I drew my flies and I drew the not the house fly. The next one up come to me anyway.Used to be a joke to me ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. The development of the individual parallels the development of the species. So that what I was finding in the wings of these pupil flies was the pattern that would emerge as the adults. And the the first vein is a major firm vein. And you had to determine whether this firm vein had this branch come off the bottom or whether they were two separate branches starting back here together.And then if you did, you got to explain why you thought this was so. And then there was, let's see, one and two, and then three and four, and then five down here. And we explained what you saw."

I think he dies, but there's not a lot of sympathy there. So at that point, the stepmother and stepsisters treat Cinderella poorly, effectively turning into herd into an indentured servant. Meanwhile, as a result of her duties, cinderella is befriending a bunch of the animals, because that's all.The only people that can hang out with her are the animals. While daydreaming about how nice it would be to live a better life like royalty, maybe simultaneously, the king is looking for an heir. His son is unmarried and they need offspring for the line to continue to foster the patriarchy. So they decide to throw a ball to find a suitable mate for the son. The announcements go out.Cinderella asks if she can go and is laughed out of the building, so to speak. But she gets creative and with the help of her animal friends, creates a really nice dress. But once she's in the dress and trying to go, the stepsisters and stepmother make sure that that's not going to be the way that it goes. They tear the dress and it looks awful. So enter the fairy godmother, who, in answer to Cinderella's unspoken please, grants her one night with this beautiful dress horse and carriage made from a pumpkin and some of her animal friends and these glass slippers.She makes it to the ball. She has a wonderful time with the prince, but by midnight, when everything is supposed to revert back, she has to roll out. It's the worst curfew ever. In the course of doing that, she leaves one of the glass slippers in her rush and everything except for the glass slipper reverts back to what it was before. But now, smitten, there has to be a search for the wearer of this glass slipper for the prince, who's then going around seeing if it fits anybody.And when he arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepmother and stepsisters do everything possible to interfere and see if enforce it to fit someone else. But it only fits Cinderella. They discover that that's who that is. She and the prince get married and live happily ever after.Great. We're all done with that. And the last prompt I have for you is just to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.So you have to have the appropriate ingredients peanut butter, jelly, bread and at least a night."

And his mom has always said, be careful because you know that that ball can be destructive if you don't control it properly. So he kicks the ball and it goes into the window where his dad is currently sitting and studying, not studying, watching TV, it looks like. And it knocks down a lamp and it breaks the window.And his dad looks out the window at him holding. And he holds the ball and looks at Jack and says to himself, I've been there before. This has happened to me before. I'm not going to yell at my kid, but boy, what a numskull. So here are some more pictures that tell a story.Take a look at all of them to begin with. And then I would like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. And you may begin when you're ready.Okay. So Leo was getting ready to walk to school and his mom said, hey, you really should take this umbrella because it is going to start raining and you're going to be really uncomfortable when you're walking to school with no umbrella and you get all wet. He doesn't really want to take it, so he says, no thanks, Mom, I got this. I'm going to hurry and get to school really fast and I'll beat the rain. So he says goodbye.She looks a little disconcerted because this isn't going to work out. And now he is walking to school and is starting to get really wet. The rain is coming down harder and faster and he's not going to get to school. He's barely even made it a quarter of the way to school. So he is going to rush back to the house as wet as he is and have to look his mom in the eye and say, mom, you were right.I probably should have taken the umbrella and I'm sorry I didn't, but I really need to take it now. So he takes the umbrella and finishes walk to school. And he's much more comfortable without all of the rain falling on him.Here is a picture. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. So try to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can keep this picture up as you go so you can use it to describe. Does that make sense?Okay, let me there I am, figured out how to mute myself when I'm in this screen. Okay, you may begin. Okay, so it looks like a pretty nice day. It was a day that this little girl was playing outside and she was clearly playing with her dog and riding her bike. And the cat got out and the cat ended up in the tree, so she had to ask her dad to come help her get the cat out of the tree.And then her dad got stuck in the tree, so the grandma was inside, and she decided to call the fire station so that the firefighters can come out and help dad and the cat get out of the tree."

And her father, being the silly man that he is, decided to go up and take care of the cat, try to at the cat. So as he goes up the tree, he gets up to the branch and the ladder falls off of the tree, at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and which scares the cat all the more. And the cat is not going to come to the father, but the father can't get out of the tree anyway, so they have to call the fire department who comes and rescues the man out of the tree and rescues the cat. The end.Thanks. There are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. One of them is to get out the bread that's already cut and put peanut butter on it. Actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store. And so all you have to do is just use one and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into the jar, and you can put it right on the bread and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Very lazy, very easy. The good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread, cut it in six inch long pieces, slice it long ways so that it's open. It's nice and crunchy on top. It's very soft on the interior. You take your peanut butter, crunchy and regular.You mix those together, you put it on the peanut, you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich, you take the jelly. I wouldn't use grape jelly, but you can use other kinds of jelly. And I like strawberry. Sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together. I put it on there and then I take that sandwich and I put it in the microwave and I heat it so that the peanut butter, the jelly and the bread all soak in together.I still have crunchy on the top, but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm, and then I eat that.Four years ago I had my knees replaced. I had them both done at the same time. It was scheduled for July the fifth. However, they dialed up on the scheduling, so it wasn't done until the next week, which is, I think, July the 11th or twelveTH.I went into the hospital at seven in the morning, 630 or seven in the morning. They prepped me and I went into the operating room about eight and woke up about 11, 11 15 with two knees.They told me to go ahead and use the morphine drip for pain, and so that's what I did. I used the morphine drip for pain."

They were out in left field as far as looks.She was hustling those two girls and making Cinderella work and wash the floors and wash the clothes.There was the mother of the boy, of the two daughters. Was very hard on her. Gave her no compliments. Very envious of her. Very jealous of her.Cinderella looks out the window one day and sees the picture or the castle where the knight lives and he is looking for Brad. And they have the silver slipper. He's got a glass slipper. I think it was glass slipper that he was trying on.No, Cinderella.Cinderella, the French, the prince. Somehow another got connected with Cinderella and took her to the Cinderella. When she rolled in, her pumpkin was told that she had to leave the ball by midnight.And she was beautifully dressed. And she had on a pair of glass slippers. I think they were just doing beautifully at the ball. And the prince, he done got himself hooked.Suddenly this clump started striking, and Cinderella knew what that meant. She had been warned."

She was kind of kept very low key with morphine.But I remembered hearing that the hearing is the last sense that people lose. So I would stay with her overnight, and I would hold her hand, hoping that that would be soothing. And it occurred to me that I could share with her memories of our time together and that I could recount beautiful images of our time at the lakeshore where we have a family home.And hour by hour, her condition was just deteriorating. It was painful to see how hard it was for her to breathe. And I couldn't imagine what was sustaining her and why she was continuing in this harrowing state when there was absolutely no hope.And so finally, I actually held her hands, and I looked in her eyes, and her whole family was gathered around, and I said, if you are afraid to leave because of us, trust that we can make it.We love you, and we send our love with you, and our love will never be lost, and it is okay for you to leave.And in that very instant, she took her last breath. Here's another series of photos that tell a story. Whenever you're ready, please tell this. Okay, now, there's only one problem, is that you and I are covering up the last image.

So he goes outside and is walking on his way, has his backpack on his back, and starts to rain. And he becomes a little distressed as the rain is pouring down on top of him. So he comes back home, and his mother he sees his mother, and she looks like she's got her hands on her hips, and she's like, well, I told you so.And he apparently agrees with that because then he takes off again, and he has the umbrella, and it's protecting him from the rain. He apparently retrieves the umbrella after he goes back to his house and starts out again.This is a picture of two people. One looks like a rescuer because he has on an orange vest, and the other one is a young woman. She apparently has fallen into a raging stream or river or some body of water that seems to be moving. And then the rescuer tries to come to rescue. He has a belt that he has, and he's grasping he could not be a rescuer.He could also be another boater that had a life jacket. And she doesn't have the life jacket, so I don't know which it is. Anyway, the man who has the red life jacket on is grasping the branch, and the woman is nearby.Both of them look pretty distressed.This is a story about Cinderella.Cinderella had two stepsisters, and her mother was a stepmother who favored the stepsisters over Cinderella. And so Cinderella had to serve them tea and do, I guess, many of the household chores. While the stepsisters didn't have to do anything.There was an announcement of an impending ball that the prince was having. And the stepsisters well, all of the girls were invited, but it was decided that only the stepsisters could go and that they would have the grand ball gowns. But Cinderella was feeling very dejected, and she, you know, kept doing her chores and everything."

But then it starts raining, so he just runs back home.And she's pretty upset with him, but still gives him the umbrella and makes him go to school anyways, so he does that. All right. Same thing with this one. It's a little bit different. It's kind of an entire scene.So you want to look at the entire picture and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay.

The little girl, it's her cat.So her dad goes up the tree to get the cat for her, but the ladder falls, and he can't really get back down, and neither can he get the cat. So they end up calling the fire department to come get the dad. That's kind of where the story leaves off. We assume that they probably get him and the cat down successfully. All right.Okay.

The neighbor picks up the soccer ball, and he goes to the window, and he looks out. We need a few more pictures. We don't know what happens next, but I imagine that he sees the boy out there. And the boy is standing out there.Absolutely.He feels terrible that he has broken the man's window. And he's shouting into the man, sir, I am so, so sorry. I have broken your window. And the man said, oh, I was a boy once, too. These things happen.We can work together to find a way to repair the window. And so they did. So this slide has a series of pictures that tell a different story. So again, just take some time to look over them and then tell me the story you see with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Are they mixed up, these pictures?No, ma'am. They go in order. Okay.All right.So are the pictures going to stay here while I tell the story? Yes, I'm not going to take any more pictures away from you. Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was on his way to school, and his mother said, the weather report says it's going to rain. Here, you take this umbrella. He said, no, I don't want to take the umbrella.Well, you better. You might get wet. No, I'm not going to so the little boy began walking to school, and sure enough, his mother was right. It began to rain. And then it began to rain harder and harder and harder.And he splashed through the puddles, and he ran back to his home, and he said, I was wrong. And she said, yes, you were. Try it again. We'll dry you off. Go to school.But this time with an umbrella. And so he did, and so he stayed dry on his trip to school. So this picture tells a story. Take a second to look at it, and then tell me what story you see with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat. And the cat was chased by a dog, and the cat ran up the tree and way out onto the limb as the dog stood barking there. And then she called her dad and said, daddy, come and help me. Help me get my cat down.So the next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the tree, and he got partway up, and then he got stuck, and he could not get down. And the cat wouldn't come down. And somebody must have seen this and called the fire department because finally they came with their ladders, and they probably shoot away the dog and they put the ladder up against the tree and they helped the father down. And then I'm going to say the cat jumped down of his own free will. End of story."

        "transcript": "Home. And the very next day, the prince is very agitated because he only knows who his favorite of the eligible women are because of glass slippers. She left, and he's carrying the glass slipper to the household of each eligible woman. And when he gets to the household of the evil stepmother, the evil stepsisters all think that it has to be one of them. And the Prince is not interested in them at all because they're nasty.And someone actually tries to break the glass slipper to keep the prince from finding out who the woman really is. But the slipper doesn't break. He finds that it fits Cinderella perfectly. And she gets to leave the house of the evil stepmother and go live with the prince and marry the prince to promote the evil monarchy into the future. And they kill the evil king.And the prince becomes king and she becomes queen. Finally I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I did that one before also. But I think I forgot a couple of things. If I was doing it today, I would walk 50ft south and then 20ft east up three stairs to the kitchen.Once in the kitchen, I would open the refrigerator. I would take out the bag which has the bread that I made a couple of days ago in the bread machine, and I'd take out that bag, close the door of the refrigerator, put the bag on the counter, take down the cutting board, open the cabinet with the knives, get out the bread knife, slice two slices of bread. Then I would put the knife back in the cabinet. I would take the two slices of bread, put them on the toaster and push down the toaster. Then I would wrap up, twist the bag, hold the bag at one end and spin it a few times, fold it under and open the refrigerator.And put the bread back in the refrigerator. While the refrigerator is open, I would find a jar of jelly and put it on the counter and close the door. Peanut butter is probably in a cabinet, but actually, there isn't any. Except for what we use for the mousetraps under the house. Get the peanut butter and get a knife out of the drawer and spread the peanut butter on one of the slices of toast after it came out of the toaster.This is out of order, like most recipes where it's like, what was I supposed to do? When was it? Do that? And I'd lick off the knife. And then I'd stick the knife from the jelly and spread the jelly on the other piece of bread, which is now toast, and assemble the two slathered pieces of toast still on the cutting board.Get the knife back out and cut it."

I don't need to take my umbrella, I'm fine.Then he waves at his mom to leave and the mom's standing holding the umbrella, and he walks outside and he gets a little ways down the street and it starts to rain. And he thinking, oh no, I should have listened to mom. And he hurries, turns around and runs back while he's getting wet, goes into the house, and his mom looks at him very unhappily while he's standing there soaking wet, and he decides to take his umbrella and starts walking off to school again with dry clothes.Okay. Cinderella's dad marries a lady with two daughters, and the two daughters and the new wife come to live with Cinderella and her father. The stepmom. And the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella and they're always picking on her and making her feel bad. And the stepmom always makes Cinderella wait on her stepsisters even as they grow older.And Cinderella has to do all the work around the house, feed the horses and everything like that. Then one day a king tells his son that he needs to find a bride. So the king tells his son, I'm going to have a dance and invite all the eligible ladies in the kingdom to come to the dance, and you can pick one, and that's the one you'll have to marry. So they send a letter out and the stepmother gets a letter and tells her two daughters that they're going to go to the dance to try to marry the king or the prince because he's rich and they can use his money. And Cinderella wants to go, but the stepmother and the stepsisters tell her no because she's too ugly and she's poor and she just needs to stay home and clean the house.So they get ready and Cinderella gets ready to go to the dance. And the stepsisters rip her dress and tell her, no, you're not going. And they leave her home. Then they leave to go, and Cinderella finds a book in a trunk and reads the book and says a spell.

And some little mice help Cinderella get to the ball by driving the chariot. And Cinderella starts to dance with the prince. And the godmother had told her that she has to be back by 12:00 or her dress and her glass slippers will go away and she'll just be normal again. So the prince falls in love with her, but she has to leave by twelve.So she rushes out and loses one of her glass slippers and then goes home. And then the next day.

And Cinderella's foot, um, fits in the glass slipper. And the Prince tells her he loves her and they get married and live happily ever after."

        "transcript": "When my daughter was born. Favorite day of my life. The worst and the best. I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell.It had no like you know that old song, what a difference a day makes from the pregnancy? Which was just wonderful. I ate everything I wanted. I felt terrific. I was working full time.My freezer looked like an Orieta convention. I could eat my crinkle, cuts my shoestrings with pasta. I could do anything. I looked like meatloaf. By the time I got to the hospital, I have to say my obstetrician during the build up to this would say, you'll be sorry.And I said, I cannot imagine regretting this. I'm making ice cream sandwiches with two pieces of pound cake with the haagendas in the middle. So then I get to the hospital and it was really nasty.It was probably the worst experience I ever had. I was told that if I had automatic weapons, there would have been no one alive left on the maternity ward.That's what I was told.And it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out. My obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook. He said, well, we're just going to break your water. It'll move things along. I said, no, don't step back, step back.Just leave me alone, I can do this myself. And then he kept saying relax. I don't understand why you're not relaxed. And this is psychological. I'm sure every time he said relax, I became even more infuriated.This is the effect it had on me. And he wasn't listening when I said Stop saying that. When you tell someone stop doing X, you expect them to stop doing that. So anyhow to fast forward. My daughter was beautiful.She was born smiling right away, recognized my voice. It was just the most special experience of my whole life. So now I went for my first postpartum checkup and I'm sitting on the table and he does the finger prick and to get some blood out and he turns around and he puts the little tube in the machine and he turns it on and the machine is whirring. And I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock. It happened really fast and I threw him onto the table.And then I jumped on top of him, put my knee in his groin and his glasses were askew and his tie was crooked. I said relax. Relax. I don't understand why you're not relaxed. What's the matter?It was such a calamity. Although it was all in good fun because later on he and his wife used to work in his office and they had a nurse too. And they said, selfishly, Linda, we really would love you to have another baby, because we never had an experience like that in our lives. It's really selfish. On apart.So that was it. That's it.

So I would get two slices of bread, a knife for the peanut butter, and my wife insists on using a spoon to get the jelly out of there, but I don't use it. But I would take and spread the peanut butter on the one piece of bread and then take the spoon and drop some jelly on the other piece of bread and spread the jelly evenly over that piece of bread.Put the two pieces together.Ready? We have a real pickle here.Looks like the family cat has been chased up the tree by their dog. And the father has gone to rescue the cat. His daughter just crying, wanting the cat to come down. She's off her tricycle. The father gets up on the limb of the tree, the stepladder falls down and then to the rescue.Somebody must have called there's a bird watching it all, but somebody must have called the fire department. And here they come running with a ladder.All right, I haven't had a stroke, but I did have a couple of stents done two years ago this past February. And I smoked up until that time, up until about two days before then. That was February the 9th or 10th, and the surgery was on a Wednesday and the procedure and Monday I ran out of cigarettes. I had one Sunday morning and I thought, heck, Ope, I don't want I'm not going to do any smoking. They're going to make me stop anyway once I get in the didn't.I had that last one Monday morning and I haven't smoked since then. But getting back to my story Wednesday of Winningham, I'd already been to the doctor. He had done a stress test and he said that we needed to look at you more closely. And what they do is they put you somewhat under and they go up through your groin with the camera and take a good look at your heart.So I was sort of out of it, but I do remember it. And I remember the doctor's name was Richard. I can't think of the last name, but they called him Rapid Richard because he was so quick. And he went in and I must have woke up. I said, well, Doc, are you there?He says, Yep, I'm there. I said, how's it look? He says, well, we're going to have a couple cents put in there's. Got some problems. All right.Must have gone back out a little bit later on. I said, Why are you doing, Doc, are you about to done? He says, Just finishing up. We should be done here in just a few minutes. Then I went back to sleep and I don't remember them rolling me back to my room or getting in my bed and that was it.It wasn't painful at all.Thank."

        "transcript": "How do you make me want to think of a really good story I've told you about my mom? That's probably the singular event that's most significant. Yeah. Okay, I'll tell you a story. This was a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind, and I still don't make any sense.So my first semester of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa in Iowa City. But my family's from DC. And I had a car. So I would drive back and forth over break time with my car. It's about 1000 miles, so it generally takes about two days.So the first semester back, it's winter. I am driving across I 80, which goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn. So it is an extremely boring, repetitive drive. There's a lot of driver tunnel vision that happens. And it's cold and gray, so it's not even pretty green fields.It's just empty, empty, empty fields. But I'm kind of proud of myself because my first semester went well. I was independent, excited. So I'm on I 80 in sort of the middle of Illinois. And there's a slowdown and it's very flat, so I can see ahead.I don't see that there's construction. I don't really see an accident, but I figure something's happened, probably a minor accident. Looks like it's a rubber necking delay. It's kind of pissing me off. I 80 at this point is only two lanes in each direction.And there's, like, no exits, nothing built along it. And we get closer and closer and closer, and I still cannot see what's going on. I'm just like, what could this be? And we get a little closer, and I see, okay, it looks like I'm in the left lane. And then there's a median between the eastbound and westbound routes.And I'm going east and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left. And it looks, as I get closer, like an animal. And I get closer, and it looks like a fairly large animal. And I'm thinking, is it a cow? Is it a moose?There wouldn't be a moose in Illinois, but it looks fairly large, and there's something unusual about it. So I'm getting a little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes, going, why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal? Wasting my time. I just want to get home. And I get closer, and I can see that there's these kind of large hind legs.So it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car. There's kind of a long tail, and it's brown, and it's this big hump. Oh, my God. And I'm getting closer and closer and closer and my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching, going, what is this thing? It's not a cow.It's not a deer. It's too big to be a dog. And I'm literally as I'm passing it, we're just creeping along. My head is sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view. And it's only till it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that my mind kind of pattern matches and goes, it's a kangaroo.Again, I have to turn around and look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me. And I sat like the next 5 miles going, no way, it was a kangaroo. And then going, but it wasn't anything else. It was a kangaroo. It was clearly a kangaroo.I saw the ears, I saw the big massive tail, I saw the big hind legs, I saw little tiny front legs. It was a kangaroo. And so to this day, it's this thing where I just don't know. I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo. And I've even searched I mean, this was okay, so this was the wind term 2000, 2001.So the internet was a thing, but it's not like Google was around, but there weren't really if you didn't know how to search."

        "transcript": "This hit in the same spot 1234 and I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any injuries. At the same time, during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle and their discretion chose to take me to the hospital and they're my drill sergeants, so I let them do that instead of saying it's just a sprain right ankle. And finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop. Well, I immediately went into shock and being in basic training there is much suggestion to do as one is told in a myriad manner of forms directly and indirectly. So my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through.I actually had to walk the next morning to the clinic on a very swollen calf. So swollen in fact, that I was unable to take the BDUs, which are the battle dress uniform which have a very, very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants from being able to be lifted up to my knee. My calf was so swollen. Unfortunately, that was the major holiday of that whole fort combination of its anniversary and 4 July. So the crew at the clinic on that Saturday, which then being a Saturday, buses never ran.So I had to walk about two and a half miles on that condition, did a very cursory and less than effective look at my injury, and described me as, rather than having traumatic shock, as just needing only soft shoe without crutches and just giving me mild anti inflammatories the next day. Because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity, my battery was given KP duty and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing KP because everyone else had been working and I had just gotten on to a sick leave myself. I was in shock continually this entire time. So I never volunteered for any of the KP duties and was therefore given the worst one, which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very, very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee. Well, regardless, to say as I got back on Monday, the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant who then immediately dismissed a staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very, very traumatic problems in my symptoms.And pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies. It continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic dysfunction within my calf and knee itself.Have you had any experience with people who've had a difficult time communicating? Like maybe foreign language speakers or somebody with a language disability?"

        "transcript": "All right. In this kingdom, there was a family who the mother died, and they had one child called Cinderella.The father remarried and the stepmother had two daughters, maybe three. And Cinderella came to live with them to make one family out of two. When the husband remarried, well, it wasn't working too well. The stepdaughters and stepmother did not like Cinderella, and they treated her like a maid. She had to do all the work.And one day, a letter came in the mail announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom so that the prince could find a suitable wife. Well, you can imagine how much excitement this called. And the stepdaughter started thinking about, what will I wear? And preparing their clothes for this occasion. And Cinderella went up and found a dress in a chest that held her belongings.And she came down and was starting to work on making this dress fit her. And the stepdaughters looked at her and they said, well, you're not going. You're not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the king's, the prince's wife. And they even tore the scarf off of her dress, the waistband. And it was bad, and it made Cinderella very sad.And she didn't know what to do. But she went outside and was crying, and the fairy appeared to her, and it turned out to be her fairy godmother that she hadn't known anything about. And the godmother said, well, don't worry. I'll arrange for you to get to the ball. So the day of the ball came, and the stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy horse and carriage.And the godmother did her magic. She turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. She turned mice into horses, and she used her magic powers and her wand to dress Cinderella in a beautiful Ballground. And she saw that Cinderella got into the carriage and went off to the ball. Her only admonition was, you must be home by midnight.Cinderella entered the ballroom and everyone turned to look at her because of her beauty and her graciousness. The prince noticed her, danced with her, fell in love with her. And Cinderella was having such a good time, she didn't think a thing. About time. She heard the start to strike midnight and was panicked and ran away as fast as she could."

And the prince was so taken by her that he longed to spend more time. But right before noon, or rather midnight, cinderella really panicked and fled the castle. She fled so quickly that she lost one of her glass slippers en route, and she fled back to her carriage and was taken home to the barnyard. And the reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight or else the spell would wear off and her true identity would be revealed.So for days afterwards, cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience, but also saddened by her lot in life and the fact that it was such a short lived pleasure. But one day, a knock came on the door, and it was a court magistrate from the prince who had this slipper and was going around to households trying to find this special lost woman. And he knew if the shoe fit, he'd identify this mysterious guest and the shoe fit for Cinderella. So with that, she was whisked away and rescued from the arms of her diabolical relatives and brought to the prince, and they married and lived happily ever after. All right, now we'll move on to something a little different.Will you please tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? That's exactly what we did the last time. It is. Okay, so you'll need to go to the fridge and take out your loaf of bread. You'll take two slices and put them on a plate face up, and you'll remove your peanut butter from the fridge and also your jelly.You'll extract a couple of knives from your silverware drawer. You'll use one knife to spread the peanut butter on one of these face up slices of bread. You'll have to open the jar first, but once you've opened the jar, you'll have to stick the knife in and spread the peanut butter on and enough to cover the bread kind of with a bit of abundance so none of the bread shows through.Then you'll take the other knife, you'll open the other can, which is of the jam, and you'll put the knife in and spread the slice of bread with this jelly. Also liberally, so that you can't see the bread."

So I put the cat on top of the tree, and she immediately left her tricycle, the way you see it now. Um, but before I could grab it, which is all that I was looking for, she started creating such a scandal about the cat being on top of the tree that my dad got involved. He tried to climb the tree to get the cat off the tree, but then couldn't make it to the branch where the cat was.And then the dog started barking at my dad because the dog wanted my dad to come off a tree. And eventually my mother had such a fit over the whole incident that she called a fire brigade to get everybody back, the cat back to my sister, my dad back to the ground. And after such a chaos, I ended up not being able to use a tricycle because I had created such a disruption of our home life that I guess I got my punishment in the act of trying to get what.So I'm going to show you some pictures. Once again, these pictures tell the story of Cinderella. I'll give you some time to look at each picture, and then we can review them again if you'd like. Afterwards, I'll have you tell me the story using any details that you remember of the story. But first, just let me know when you would like me to change to a new picture.It would you like to see any of those pictures again?No. Okay, then I will stop sharing my screen.

And then whenever you're done, I'm going to take the book back and have you tell me the story of Cinderella as you can.You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Okay, so it starts with Cinderella's dad marries, like on her mom's dad, and her dad marries this woman who has two daughters of her own, and they start a new family. But then her dad passes away, and the mother ends up being extremely evil, and her daughters are really mean to. And then she grows up and she becomes the servant girl of the house. She cooks for them and cleans for them.And her only friends are the animals, which she talks to. And one day in the kingdom, the king basically says his son needs to get married. He wants all of the eligible bacheloretes, I guess, in the kingdom to come to the fall. So he comes around giving invitations to all the families. And the evil stepmother gets the invitations, reading it, and her two daughters are really excited.And Cinderella wants to go. She goes up and she goes into a trunk. I think it was like her mother's clothes or something like that. And she finds this old gown. And I know all of her little bird friends and stuff help her put together this really beautiful outfit.So later, when the ball comes around, everyone's ready to go, her steps sisters are ready, and she comes down, and they basically tear up her dress. And they say she's not allowed to go. And I know in some versions, they give her a lot of chores to do. So they basically make it that she can't go. She goes outside and she's really upset, and her godmother appears."

And then there's this nice older woman who has a special wand and says, oh dear, I'm going to take care of it for you. And then poof, she waves her wand and then turns a pumpkin into a carriage and her mice and dog friends into footmen and horses. And then the next problem was that she didn't have anything to wear. So then she waves her wand and miraculously she's got a cool hairdo.She's got her hair is all done up. She is wearing a beautiful white dress and glass slippers. So off she goes to the ball. She gets to the ball. She looks so amazing that no one knew who she was.And of course the Prince was like, oh, you're so wonderful. And so then the Prince can't take his eyes off of her, dances with her all night until the clock starts to strike twelve. So then she remembers something that the older woman, the fairy godmother, had said. You have to get home before the last strike of twelve at midnight. So she runs out of the castle because she doesn't want anyone to know her true identity.And she goes running down the stairs and as she's fleeing the scene, she loses one of her glass slippers and one of the servants of the princes runs and picks it up. But it's too late, she's already gone. And on the way home, the pumpkin turned back into a pumpkin and the dog turned back into a dog, et cetera, et cetera. But she goes home and she's got these happy memories of being in the Prince's arms. And I think that her family mother in law captor not mother in law.Yeah, stepmother. I don't think that they knew that she was the one. I think they had no idea. But for some reason she was locked inside of her room because I remember the key that the mice had used, the key to let her out. So I don't remember why, but she was locked in her room.And at any rate, so the prince desperately wanted to find this beautiful young woman that he danced with. So they send out one of their servants to go out and try to find this woman by having all of them try on this class slipper. Of course it's not fitting. It's not fitting ironically that no women seem to have a foot that fits into these. I don't understand, why does she have such tiny feet?I don't get it. But at any rate, yeah, that doesn't seem to work. And then somehow, because of the mice opening the door, she had been locked upstairs in some sort of a tower, I don't know what it was. And then she's freed and she comes down and she tries on the glass slipper and it is discovered that yes indeed, she was the one that was dancing with the prince, and everybody's like, oh. And then she gets sent off to go with the king or the prince and live happily ever after.And what happens with the stepmother and the stepdaughters? I do not know. But perhaps Apps Karma decided that. I don't know. I think that's the end of the story."

I was just a little over halfway through. And then my first trip to sea, I was still 17 and I turned 18 a couple of days out. But I found that I was on the armed guard service. And during a big war, merchant ships are outfitted with guns, and the Navy puts a few people on there to man the guns, and then they go to all kinds of strange ports and they often travel in convoys, so they needed a train signal.And that's why I went to the communications group. And then the second ship I was on, I was in New Orleans, having gone through the canal.And in the old days, you had to go to a movie and they would have the news before the television. And there was this ship, a Liberty ship.It was named Samuel Gompers, who was the head of the AFL American Federation of labor. And they had built it on Labor Day in 1942. And I saw it on the movie Tone. And later I was assigned to that ship.And we went to Auckland, New Zealand, 20 days, 21 days, and then Wilmington and then over to Sydney. And then we went up less than 100 miles up to Newcastle and took on a load of coal, and we went to New Caledonia and then unloaded the coal and then went up to the north end of the island and took on a load of nickel ore. And then we went back to Numia. And then we left at about 04:00 in the afternoon.And the next morning, about ten minutes, a few minutes before 04:00 A.m., we got torpedo. And so it we were in the lifeboat."

        "transcript": "Okay. Cinderella is a young girl whose mother died and she's brought by her father to live with, I think, a sister of his, who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age. Father meant well, but the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully. She became their maid, essentially and had to clean the house, take care of the fireplace. Hence the name Cinderella.Do the cooking, do the washing. While they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to please themselves. One day, the prince they lived in a principality. The prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the or all of the single women in the principality would be invited and the idea would be that the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife. Cinderella's.Three stepsisters. Prepare for the ball. Her mother's very excited. And of course, Cinderella is excluded. She cannot go to the ball.And so she's left at home alone. While the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball, she's visited by her fairy godmother, who grants her her wish of attending the ball because Cinderella says, how am I going to get there? What am I going to wear? So the fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her out of magic. Takes a pumpkin, causes it to become a coach.Mice become the horses. I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman, too. I forget which animal becomes the coachman. They take her to the ball. She's not really recognized by her stepsisters and the stepmother.But the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight. Otherwise or at midnight, everything would turn back to what it was. The coach would become the pumpkin again, et cetera. So she promises to return at midnight. But she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight.So she panics, rightly? So runs, gets back in the coach and is taken home. But one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the Fairy Godmother made for her is left behind. And the prince at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to know who she was because she was going to be the one. And the only thing he had to go on was this slipper that she left behind.So he has all of the young ladies in the principality. Try the slipper on. It's brought to each of their houses. And of course, the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for, the one who was at the ball. And sure enough, it Is Cinderella's Foot that Fits Glass Slipper to The Great Surprise And Dismay of Her Stepsisters And Stepmother, and but to her great delight and the prince marries her and they live happily ever after."

We were then flying the the swept wing version of the F 84, known as the F 84 F. And we had been out on a series of missions and we were just returning to the base.Well, actually, I was by myself. I was flying solo, not in formation with anybody. It was just a regular training flight to add hours to my logbook and that of the airplane and also proficiency, just practice, practice this, practice that. Well, in those times we, we had a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at 340 knots air speed.When we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back, tilt the airplane onto a wing and suck back on the stick in a very tight, 180 degree turn in order to dissipate air speed sufficiently that it would be safe to drop the landing gear, the flaps and the speed brakes. Which I did. And that was called the downwind leg at 180 degrees. After that, the airplane is slow enough so that we would have not have touched the throttle. Neither would it cut power completely and just bring it on around to the, you know, to a full 360 degree turn and then land on the runway.Well, the legs of the, of the pattern are called the approach, 180 degrees, the downwind 90 degrees from that is the base and following that is the final. So just fell off. You're actually flying in a circle. Well, here I am on the base leg with no power. All the garbage is out.We call it garbage speed brakes, the flaps and the landing gear. And all of a sudden I'm about, I don't know, 300 hundred, 4ft off the ground. No more than that. Maybe five, six, 7800ft, something like that, I'm not really sure. The airplane started to shudder.A shuddering is the sign of a stall. That means the air. When and when an airplane stalls, it means it's falling out of the sky. And I knew immediately people do not survive these situation like this. And yet I automatically I almost didn't have time to think.But I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of records off the end of the runway. And I didn't want that to happen. Well, what did I do? I gave it full power, which did not catch in time. I pulled on the land."

And I noticed other people noticed that I was always sitting in pictures with my hands on my cheek or my hand under my chin.And they laughed at me. They said, oh, you're just trying to get rid of your double chin. And then I said to my doctor, I said that it seemed to be a problem because I was losing some feeling in my hand. And he said, well, it could be something with your neck too. I said, well, all I can tell you is all my friends make fun of me because if you look at all my pictures, I'm sitting with my hand on my face or under my chin or something like that.I said, It's just like my head's too tired to hold up my neck anymore. So then they did an MRI and they said, oh, yeah, good thing you tried to say something. Then I did 140 steroid shots over a year, and I gained 50 pounds, and I looked like a balloon. And I was not addicted, but I lived on oxycoding because the pain was just so tremendously bad. And then I finally went and got a second opinion from a neurosurgeon who said, we're scheduling your surgery for this week.You're lucky you didn't lose the use of your right hand because there's almost nothing left of your nerve over there. So then they scheduled me. They cut open my neck, moved everything to the side, put some titanium rods in there. I went through some physical therapy, and I was off work for three months, and I couldn't drive and I couldn't run the vacuum, even though I felt great, I wasn't allowed to. So I relied on a lot of people to keep me from going insane, being in the house for three months until they took me out and did things.And then I just rehabbed it and got better and just the support of everybody around me and even my spouse saying, no, you're not going to run the vacuum. I'm going to run the vacuum. No, you're not going to get the milk. I'll get the milk for the kids. So just having him be very supportive and friends and family stop by in my situation, it worked out great.So now I'm full use of my hand. No more dropping my coffee cup. That's it. Have you had any difficulty any experience with people who have difficulty communicating in some way? And that's kind of a broad topic.Any type of difficulty communicating?If you can think of someone that's a little stronger willed than I, okay, so this is a good choice. So what I'd like for you to do is kind of tell me what problems there are with communicating with this person and what you did or do about it. And just the problem being, no matter what I say, it's not right. But if somebody else says the same thing, then it's accepted differently. So tried just not saying anything."

        "transcript": "Well, I did several surgeries, I had three surgeries early when I had the initial operation, that was before the days of scopes arthroscopes. So my first one was what I call slice and dice, they cut it and took the pieces out. The next two were scopes, and in those the way the scope went, the second one, they were able to get some additional pieces that had fallen out. The third one, they were looking around at the knee, and I remember distinctly the doctor saying, oh, what was that? And he moved the scope a little bit and saw a piece of meniscus floating by the scope, and he says, oh, we must have missed this on the last surgery.So that was that. So after that, I was still relatively young, but it got to the point where I started getting pains. Once I was 55, ish started getting pain, I went to an orthopedic surgeon, he worked with me for several years, did injections, trying to take care of lubing the knee so it would be okay. And eventually those lubrications did not work, so that's when they went in for the total knee replacement. Since then, I've had lots of fun, I've actually been back to a different surgeon because we found out through going to a different surgeon that the appliance that they used in my knee was one version, and the guy that I went to said, wonder why they used that one?And what they found was my PCL, which holds one part of my knee to the other part of my knee was basically he used the word mangled. So it had been stretched out and twisted so much that my knee would pop out of place.And he gave me two options. One was surgery, and that changed the appliance, I'd have to do another total knee replacement and put in the new appliance or go rehab. So I did rehab, I actually did a unique kind of rehab, I use a personal trainer, and they were able to send him the information about my injury. So he was able to work with me knowing what the problem was, he worked with me to get to the point where I was in very good shape on the knee. I still have problems, but most of the way I've been recovering.Our next prompt, we can move on here. Have you ever had an experience with people who have a difficult time communicating?I have had a case where I was working with a person that was doing a network evaluation. It's what I used to do. And the gentleman that I was working with had an extremely heavy Indian accent, and the Indian accent with the British wording made some of the times that it was hard to catch what he was saying. So I really had to work, slow down, listen closer, and get him to slow down too."

But far from incorporating the daughter, the new daughter, to her daily life, she and the two daughters task her with the most menial tasks and make her do the laundry and iron the sheets and clean and wash. And they don't let her participate in their daily lives.So one day the ruler of the land sends the news that he's going to organize a big ball and that all the inhabitants of the county are invited. So of course the two sisters get very excited, but so does Cinderella and she wants to go too. But on the night of the ball she shows up with a very simple dress and the two sisters tell her that that's totally inappropriate and she cannot go to the ball with that dress. So Cinderella is in great distress as the sisters depart for the ball. But lo and behold, here comes the fairy godmother and gives Cinderella a splendid dress and a carriage to take her to the ball.But she must come back before 12:00 midnight or she's going to turn into pumpkin. So Cinderella goes to the ball and dances with the prince, who falls madly in love with Cinderella. But she must leave in haste at twelve midnight before she turns into pumpkin. In departing the ball in such a hurry, she drops one of her shoes. One of her shoes comes off her foot and is left behind.So then she goes home and goes back to her menial tasks and sharing a lot with the little mice and the horses and the other sheep, the other farm animals, maybe including sheep or pigs or whatever that form the household. Until one day she catches news that somebody's looking for the owner of her shoe, because the prince wants to find the owner that he madly fell in love with at the ball. So both her sisters try the shoe, but the shoe won't fit until Cinderella tries the shoe on. She proves that she is the owner of the shoe. The prince gets in touch with her, probably not by email, but by some other means of the time.And eventually they get married and live happily ever after. Please tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. All right. First of all, I would check that I have the ingredients, which would be two slices of bread and a jar of peanut butter and a jar of grape jelly usually, but any marmalade will do, orange jelly will do.

It could be happy or sad. It can come from any point in your life, just an event that stands out in your mind that you could describe to me. You can have a moment to think about.It's a big topic, so you can take your time. Oh, that's easy. I've been thinking about this lately.Okay, I'm going back to my childhood. I grew up riding horses. I had to have a horse. I knew from early on that I wanted a horse. So I finally got a horse, and my mom found me a trainer, someone to teach me how to ride and show horses.And I was, I think, eight years old. And it came to my first horse show. And I got on sam was the name of the horse and was very nervous, had on my whole tuxedo. So in horses, when you show, you walk, trot and canter. And with Sam, when you wanted to make Sam canter, you tapped his left shoulder with your foot, with your boot.And I was behind this other horse, and the announcer said, Canter your horses. And this horse in front of me kicked Sam in the left shoulder, and Sam took off at a gallop, and both of my parents were there, and the horse was out of control. I couldn't stop the horse. And actually, my brother was there too, and he was taking pictures of me falling off Sam.And I fell flat on my back, and I lost my breath, I couldn't breathe. And my father, who is a doctor, he jumped the fence, and he immediately resuscitated me back to breathing. And the highlight of the story is my parents never went and watched me show horses again.It stressed them out too much. But that was like, the only bad horse show I had. And I went on to show horses very happily. It was the love of my life, was showing horses horses for the next five years, I guess, maybe longer. Again, we have these four pictures.Please take a look at each one and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. You may begin.A little boy's, young boy, is playing practicing soccer in his yard and kicks the ball through a window, hopefully of his own home, and hits his dad. Hopefully, it's his dad on the knee, on the lap. Ball goes right in the lap, and the father looks out the window. Who hit me? Who broke my window with the soccer."

They treated her very badly, and she cooked and she cleaned, and she slaved away all day long. And then one day, the king wanted his son to get married.So he insisted that his son throw a ball and invite every woman in the kingdom to find a wife.

        "transcript": "Okay, so soccer is played primarily with the feet. There's a ball that two teams of eleven people each vy for control of.Yeah. So I think of those eleven, one is a goalie each. Each team has a goalkeeper and a goal on a pitch of grass about the size of a football field maybe. Yeah. So like 300ft lengthwise, maybe like 150ft width wise.So that comprises the boundaries of the playing field, the playing space. And the eleven players, including the goalie, comprise halves of the playing space. So that playing space is cut in half. There's eleven on one side, eleven on the other. And then at halftime, sides are switched.But the way it starts is a coin is flipped. And whoever wins the coin toss, that team will start kicking the ball to its teammates from the center of the field.So what happens is it's eleven on eleven. There are different lines of that eleven the way it's ordered on the field. The people in the front of that group of eleven, they're main task is to score on the opposing goal. The ones behind them are kind of defense and offense. They can score, but their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score.And then the people behind them, it's usually three or four are like the last line of defense. They're called defenders. And they keep the ball far away from the goalie if they can. And the goalie is the absolute line and last line of defense, kind of guarding the goal and keeping the ball from going into the goal. The major rules is that the only person that can use their hands except on out of bounds throws, are the goalies.The goalies can use their hands at any time, but like any of the players, they ever touch the ball, that's a penalty with their hand. They're just moving the ball by doing what's called dribbling or passing with their feet.Scoring happens when the opposing team kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net, into the netted goal. And they can do that through what's called a penalty kick and a corner kick or just regular gameplay kick into the goal. The duration, the contest will last 70 to 90 minutes. And the teams that do the best are constantly moving the ball in triangles. I think this is my theory, where they're passing the ball to each other in triangular formations.They're spreading out in triangular formations over the playing field and giving the person with the ball like options of passage, passing of the ball to people at different points in the triangles. And you can pass back backwards, you can pass forwards, you can pass across the field to open space."

        "transcript": "I am quite sure I could. Let's see, something important that happened would be I guess, let's see. I was 19 years old. I had a full time job, but I was still kind of bored living at home. So I decided to take a part time job.My brother used to work at a bowling center. Actually still does. Been there for 40 some years. Oh, my goodness gracious. Anyway, so my brother Eddie, he's the one I did the kidney with, he goes, well, why don't you just come and do some part time work at the bowling center?I'm like, well, okay, I will. So I did that for maybe a couple of months, and this guy came in really cute, a couple of years younger than me. And Eddie hired him to be the bus, know, clean the tables. And, um, and we all became good friends. And his name was Rob.Well, fast forward that. We've now been married 35 years.My oldest brother hired my husband to be.So now I'm going to show you these pictures. Take a little time to look at all the pictures, and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay? Let's see. One day, a boy went for a walk, and he had his soccer ball with him.He's on the soccer team, so he likes to practice. So he was walking and walking and decided he's just going to go and kick this ball. Well, that wasn't a good idea because when he kicked it, he hit a house through the window. Unfortunately, there was someone right there in the chair who also saw the whole thing, and he was not happy. So he jumped up real quick and guy in the house and said, who did that?But looked like the boy was gone. The end. Here are some other pictures that tell a story. I'd like you to take a look at all of them. And then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay. One day, a little boy wanted to take a walk, and it was raining. And his mother said, but you can't go out unless you have an umbrella because you'll get wet. And he's like, I don't really want to. She goes, but you're going to have to if you want to go out.So he's like, I think I'm just going to go out anyway. She didn't like that too much, so he went out in the rain. And you know what? He didn't like it so much because it was pouring and he got drenched. So he went back in the house.He was really wet. Mom was not happy with him. She goes, so if you want to go back in the rain and walk, that's fine, but you have to take an umbrella this time. And he goes, yes, ma'am. And he walked out with his umbrella.And had a great walk in the rain. So here is a picture. I would like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. And I'd like for you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay.One day, a father daughter, they were taking a walk with their cat, and while they were walking, a dog started chasing the cat, and the cat got really scared, so the cat ran up a tree. Well, then the dad got worried he was trying to get the cat, so he actually got up there, but then he got stuck.So she's trying to get the cat to come down by jumping in her arms. But that didn't work either. But thank goodness someone saw all this and called the fire department, who helped get everyone out of the tree. The end."

He's like chasing the cat up there, trying to get the cat down. Dog's barking at the bottom of the tree there's. Cat ain't coming down as you're sitting there going, oh dear. And then must be his daughter was trying to catch a cat in case he does fall down.Evidently dad lost his ladder and the firemen are coming and they're coming with a ladder and hopefully they get him all down and everything's okay.Subject 67 H doing Event Cast Directions well, this looks like out in the country with a couple, a man and a woman in a car and they're driving. You can see a farmhouse close to farms in the country. There's a farmer by a little tree there and he's waving at him and saying hello. They're waving back. Evidently they must be lost.The man took out a map and was asking the farmer directions or where they're at. And then the farmer's given them directions and pointing to where and how to get wherever they're going. So they take off driving down the road and the farmer went back to digging the plant, the tree. So he's there alone.All of a sudden Mill was digging. There's the car again and the couple again going the same way. And he looks very astounded going, how do they get back here?He's probably thinking he just looks very astounded that, what are you doing here?Subject 67 H Event Cast Couple it's the inside of the house and there's a couple fighting. Looks like she's yelling at the man. They're yelling back at each other. He's reading a newspaper and she's got her coat on her suitcase, heading for the door. Evidently she's going to leave him.He looks all distraught, very distraught that she left. He's still sitting in the chair. And then the door opens and there she is. They look at each other, he gets up, she's crying and he opens up his arms to welcome her home anyway, and they're hugging at the door and everything like that. And it looks like she crashed a car towards the car going, well, what happened here?That must be why she's crying, because of crash car. I'm sure they'll be all right."

His dad was sitting in the living room when the ball came in and hit a lamp. And his father looked outside and immediately knew who did it because he was the only one standing there. Okay.All right. So like you to do the same thing. Take a look at these pictures and they tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end.A woman told her son to carry an umbrella to school with him because it was going to rain. He said he didn't need it and he said goodbye and went to school. But on the way to school, he noticed that it started raining. However, he didn't turn back to go back to his house until it started pouring. When he got home, his mother was angry because he was wet, and she also said, I told you so.Then he had to change clothes and was sent back to school with the umbrella. Okay, great. And now I'd like for you to take a look at this picture. And again, tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right.A little girl's cat saw a bird in a tree and climbed the tree to get to the bird. However, the cat got stuck in the tree and the little girl called the man over with his dog to come and get the cat out of the tree. So when he set up the ladder, his dog got excited about the cat and the tree and knocked the ladder over, which prompted the little girl to call the fire department to come get the man and the cat out of the tree. Okay, there you go. So now I'm going to let you take a look through this picture book.It tells the story of Cinderella, so the pictures might remind you of how it goes. Just take a look at the pictures, and then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words.It forgot about that part. Okay, once more time. A man whose wife had died a long time ago, and his daughter lived alone until the man met an a woman with two daughters. They moved in and he was married. And then he died.And the stepmother of the man's daughter adopted the daughter, but didn't love her as much as she loved her and children, so she made Cinderella. That's the girl's name, the maid."

If I remember, cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl, nice man, took her home to his family or somebody.And the stepmother already had daughters and they took her in, but they treated her like a servant and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff.And she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear. And she was usually in the kitchen cleaning.And an invitation came to the family to attend a ball, I think, in honor of Prince Charming or somebody. And the evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and be rich.So they all got fancied up to go to the ball. And Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go and she wanted to go, and she was crying about it.And a good fairy godmother came along. I'm not quite sure how she got there. And she was able to turn ordinary things and creatures around her into fabulous ones. And she turned a pumpkin into a coach and old mags into beautiful horses and turned the mice into something anyway. And she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left.When she came in, the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her. And they danced the night away and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry.Then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning. So she had to be sure to leave by midnight. And she was a little late. She was running down the stairs to get to her coach and she lost a glass slipper and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her. I think she jumped in the coach and they ran away from it and it turned back into a pumpkin and her clothes turned back into rags and she had one glass slipper on her foot.And then the prince was very sad."

        "transcript": "Since you have not had a stroke, I wonder if you could tell me what you remember about any illness or injury that you've had.I think I parallel told the story of the elbow the previous what else have I ever ah, there's the thumb.Which one is ah that one. That was when I worked at Fermilab in Chicago for a couple of years and I lived in an area called West Chicago and had a motorcycle I bought when I was living in Bloomington after I'd graduated geology degree but didn't want to leave. Well, I didn't leave town until I got the job at Fermilab because to do something. I was working for the university physical plant doing sheet metal and roofing stuff and wasn't getting paid much, but it was enough to buy a Kawasaki H 1500 CC two stroke, three cylinder motorcycle which was very fast but handled really badly and to be really careful. But the only real wreck I ever got into it I was in Chicago, I was going home from Fermi lab back to the house I lived in, sort of in the country between DuPage County Airport and the little old town of West Chicago.And as I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and the bike started vibrating really badly. I didn't recognize it because I'd had back tires go low before but never had a front tire go low before. So all I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder the front brake and push the rear brake. And since the front tire had gotten really low it just suddenly like down into the street and tossed me into the ditch.I got up out of the ditch and there are two problems. One is that back then I wasn't very good at wearing protective safety gear. So I was riding a motorcycle without a shirt, even had pants and shoes, so I had gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder that I hit with the shoulder. But the other problem was this thumb was just kind of dangling like it wasn't connected anymore because it wasn't this bone here was just broke and clear off. So this was really too many years ago to remember.It's 1979, but I think some of the neighbors are driving into the same gravel drive that I lived in and helped me roll the motorcycle kind of up the little hill a bit and parked a motorcycle and then maybe they gave me ride home, I don't know. I just remember getting into my car even then. I had two cars. One of the cars that would go to the DuPage County Hospital and went to emergency room. They looked it over and they bandaged it up and made me appointment to back on Monday.It was Friday probably I went back Friday."

But as long as you don't sell nothing, you haven't lost it, if you understand what I'm saying, where a lot of people and I don't understand the business world, telling these people, especially the mutual fund brokers and that telling people to cash their stuff in and go to a mutual fund. Well, to me that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example, I've got a lot of procter and Gamble and it was up last summer, I guess around $74 a share right now. It's about 48 or 49.Now to tell somebody to sell that and take a 30 $35 share loss, it's kind of ridiculous to me. But now, I guess that's the way these agents make their money. By talking to people, the public, into relinquishing what they've got. That's good. Now I don't say you should keep all your stocks, but you give them a blue chip.Then I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive shares. As a matter of fact, just last Friday I went out and bought thousand shares of Ford and also I bought a thousand shares of AK Steel. Now if you really being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier, and I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday when you get a lot of diversified opinions and to sell the automobiles out, it doesn't make sense. But now on AK Steel, that's the same way they were $74 a share. And now I put a bid in for $6 a share and I'm pretty cool.That was 576 when I started playing phone tag with the broker. Like I said last Friday, I went to Fifth 3rd, met a broker there and we put in a buy for it. Now if you don't understand what a buy means, it was selling 621. That said, when it goes down to six, buy me 1000 shares of it. And my reason for doing that is Obama wants to improve all the infrastructure.Okay, infrastructure means steel. And that's where AK Steele comes in. And although they haven't completed through Congress what they want to do, what they're trying to say by American, I really don't believe in that. But it's really going to push the American steel up and all American industries are going to start making recoveries. But it was funny, I just listened this morning on television before I come down here and the state of Kentucky is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States.They're trying to pass that right think. To me that was the most interesting thing to me and the worst thing was losing all that money. At my age, of course I don't have to sell anything, and I'm not going to sell it. And maybe my heirs will. My wife will.But hopefully by the end, if I leave that long, it'll go back up again."

        "transcript": "In my case, I think I went over 200.And I remember my it felt like the back of my head was going to explode at the base of my skull just from so much pressure. And I'd never passed out in my life. I'd been knocked out once playing football, but I never passed out. And I knew I was going to pass out. And I told the doctor that, and she said, okay, lay back.So I looked at her and said, I don't dare. So she put her hands behind me and laid me back. And at that point, I don't know what was going on externally, but internally, I was fishing with my grandfather, and it was at a favorite fishing place that I had when I was growing up. And he was walking up the stream bank, wanting to continue fishing, and I was trying my darndest to catch up to him. And I said, I want to go.I want to go. No, it's not your time to go fishing with me. Go home. So I woke up and later was told that I can recall, actually. I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not, but I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was looking at myself and looking at the doctor and watching what they were doing, and it was like, Jeez, what are you doing to me?And then it hit me that, oh, yeah, they're doing it to me.My wife has to fill in the details of other stuff that happened, but apparently they brought in the crash cart and I guess zapped me at least once. I did come back. Overall, I was out for seven minutes, not breathing for seven minutes, and to this day have had little if any effects. After effects from that, they say, Seven minutes, your brain is dead. Well, I have no idea why, but it didn't affect me.I'm sure sometimes it affects me in some of my memory, but that could be aging too.That is very vivid to me.The probably the most vivid recollection I have of communication issue with someone was an employee who was actually hired for me. We came in as I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe and needed an assistant. The assistant was brought in, and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us, we all kind of looked at each other and said, what did he just say? He's Filipino.He was, I believe, born in the US. But he's raised Filipino. So he talks the Gallic language, I think it is."

Every eligible girl in the kingdom was invited. And then Cinderella made her dress out of the sash and necklaces and stuff that she borrowed from her stepsisters.But when she came down the night of the ball, her stepsisters took it all back and ruined her dress. And then the stepmother gave her a list of chores to do before she could go to the ball. But of course they took forever, so she didn't think she was going to be able to go, so she was crying.

But Cinderella was like, wait, I have the other one, and brought it downstairs. And then she married the prince, and they lived happily ever after. Okay, great. And so I just have one more thing.It's a little different. I would like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. First, you have to gather two slices of bread, a knife and a spoon and a plate, a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly. You take one slice of bread and you put peanut butter on one side using the knife.Then you set that down and pick up the next slice of bread. And you put jelly on a single side with the spoon. Then you take the two pieces of bread with the peanut butter and the jelly on the inside bread and you put them together and you have a peanut butter and jelly."

It is a great joy and pleasure to have him here at home and not somewhere else, such as in the hospital or nursing home. We are managing. We are doing very well, don't you think, Ted? Did you hear that?He said, yeah, we're doing the best we can with what we have, and it's working perfect. That's so good to hear. Okay, so the next question is about an important event in your life. This can be any important event from childhood to now. It could be happy or sad.And I just want to hear about something that was important. So think for a second about a moment you'd like to share, and then I will put myself on mute so that I can limit the background noise. And whenever you are ready to go, feel free to tell me the story.Well, Ted, shall we tell her the story of when we got our first daughter? That's a happy one. We'd like to tell you our happy story. Ted and I got married, and I worked for two years. And then we decided it might be time for us to start a family.But two more years went by and didn't happen. And after a minimal amount of medical intervention, not much, we decided to sign up with an adoption agency. And we had talked about this before we got married, that we thought we would like to have a family and maybe it might be nice to adopt children. So now we had this opportunity. So we signed up with the adoption agency, and after we had completed all of the paperwork, they said, now you can wait.And it might be a long time, but this was in 1968, when it was easy to get a child. Not like it is now. And five months into the procedure, I got a call one day from our social worker who said, Are you sitting down? And I said no. But I will.And she said, we have a baby for you. We have a little girl. Can you come and get her tomorrow? Yes, we can. Ted and I had been in the process of setting up the nursery, and now he worked until 02:00 in the morning to finish painting and finish the crib.And so we got to our 10:00 appointment the next morning. It was in October. I still remember how beautiful the golden cottonwood leaves were on the trees. This was in Denver, Colorado, and we were invited to come into the agency. And we filled out some papers.Then we were ushered into the little nursery. And there in a little white crib, wearing a tiny little pink dress with little white flowers, lay our baby. We signed more paperwork, picked her up, loved her, and took her home. And have been living happily ever since. Four years later, we adopted another child.Michelle is blonde and blue eyed from Denver, Colorado. Our second child is Cynthia and she has black hair and brown eyes. And she was born in South Korea. So we are an international family. So knows my happy story."

And then she didn't want to climb up there herself, so she got her dad to go climb up the tree, and then he got stuck, and then now he can't get down either, and they don't know what to do. So the little girl goes and calls fire department. Everyone's going crazy, and the dog's barking also because of the cat.And the end of the story is that they get the ladder, and they go up and rescue the cat and rescue the man. Okay, thank you. And this one, this is just a sequence of pictures that tells a story. And again, I want you to tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay?Beginning, middle, end. Well, this boy's playing with the soccer ball. He's being real reckless, kicks it through this guy's window, and he's sitting in his living room, enjoying himself, and he's startled. And then he picks the ball up and looks out the window, I assume angrily.And the end of the story, which is in the imaginary this box off of the page as it goes out, and he gives the ball back, and then he forgives the boy because he's a nice person, all right? Most people are like and then he makes him pay for the road, and then he calls the cops on him.Okay, so this is the last one of the kind of picture sequences, so just same thing. Take a look at the pictures and then give me a story. Okay?Hmm.Well, it's obviously raining outside, but the boy's not listening to his mom, who wants him to take the umbrella. And so he goes, okay. Yeah. I guess in picture two, it looks like he's he's happy. And then the mom's angry, but I guess he's just saying, whatever, mom, it doesn't matter.I'll be fine. She's being real angry with him, and he goes outside, figures out he really doesn't want the umbrella. He comes back in. The mom gives him the I told you so look. Stripping wet.And then he decides to take the umbrella after all."

        "transcript": "It, I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone. Well, with low rpm, there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes, so they remained extended. What happened then is that I brought the airplane down. I overshot the run way, but I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway, off to one side. And the F 84 F has a yaw characteristic at full stall, which means that the nose will turn 30 or 40 degrees either to the left or to the right.You can't predict it, but it will do that later. It was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe, because it's a jet. And you could also see where the grass was carried forward by contacting with the tail as it came in. Tail low. Well, pretty soon there came the ground.In retrospect, I can remember very well that the horizon was jumping up and down and the airplane did yaw, but it still kept going in the same direction. It yawed. And as I say, I remember the horizon bouncing up and down, but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth, I could have been painting it on. Well, eventually it did come to rest. It had yawed to the right so that at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway, which is frequently in place, which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up.Well, they about panicked. Well, at which I followed the proper procedures. I cut all power, turned everything off, and with my parachute still trapped onto me, I think I may well have set a record for the 50 yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing. I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again. All they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground.They towed it back into the hangar on its own wheels, and it did fly again. So did I, of course, but in this moment of panic was only a quick flash. The thought was, I know what I need to do, but people don't walk away from these things. I walked away. It was later determined that while I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of 340 knots, one of my buddies was in back of me, also alone.And his testimony was that he was indicating 320 knots, which is 20 knots slower than I was indicating. But he could tell that he was overtaking me. So obviously it was an airspeed."

        "transcript": "Yeah. Try to just be patient and continually try to open those doors of communication. So it's my mother. It's a lifetime process, but maybe in the next 20 years or something, there's a little boy playing soccer outside, trying to learn how to kick the ball better, and he still hasn't quite learned. So as he kicks the ball, it goes through the window into the house, and there's the man sitting inside, probably his dad, who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened.So there is a little boy getting ready for school, and his mom comes up and says, don't you want to take your umbrella? And he says, no. He's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself. So he doesn't want to take his mother's good advice. He goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining very, very hard.There are puddles everywhere. It's really uncomfortable to be that wet. So he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a lot better because now he has some weather protection.So there is a little girl whose mother has died, and so her father meets someone else, wants to have a new mother for her. So she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters. She's excited, but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean, and the stepmother is very cruel. So all the years as she's raised with them, during the beginning few years, it's okay, it's not great. And then her father dies, and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters, and they basically make her to be a maid.They're never very kind to her, and she has to do all the work on the farm, and she has to work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food. So there's also, in this same area, a castle, the prince and a king that live all the way in the castle. And the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son, the prince. So he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region. So an invitation for a ball so that the prince can choose a bride.And they get this invitation at Cinderella's house. The stepmother reads it, and the ugly, mean stepsisters are very excited. They want to go meet this handsome prince, and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess. So they get ready for the ball, and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball. She wants to go dance and have fun.So she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends, making this beautiful dress for the ball. And when she goes out and is about to leave. Her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go. She's not going to go. They rip off all of her jewelry, they tear apart her dress, and they leave her locked in the house as stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as well.So Cinderella is very sad. She doesn't know what to do. And then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball and fill her destiny."

Then you put on peanut butter and then you put on the jam, and then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top and cut it in any way so desired. All right, we have a man stranded in a tree because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat because a little girl was crying because the cat was up in the tree. And after the man climbed in the tree, his ladder fell down, a dog came along and was barking up the tree.And the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man. And I am assuming everything ends up okay. The end. Well, the most recent episode is a broken bone, but it's not a big deal. I had been having pain in my left foot.The more I walked, the more it hurt, but I really just kind of ignored it. I was more concerned about my right foot with the toenail looking like it was lifting off the bed. And I didn't quite know what to do about this, so I made an appointment with the foot doctor. But my foot doctor is in Joaquin, Illinois, and let's see how did that we had been on a cruise and we had visited our children in Orlando and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan so I could see the foot doctor.And, man, I don't remember what happened. But anyway, when I finally got to the foot doctor, she just explained that the reason the nail was lifting off was because when she had removed the ingrown toenail, a new nail was growing underneath. So she just took the top nail off, took half a minute, that was done. And then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting. And so, of course, she feeling it and found the very painful spot.And that led to x rays, which showed there was a small broken bone, which led to my having to wear a boot for a month and then come back for more x rays. So I came back to Arizona, then I turned around a month, went back to Joaquin, more x rays, and the stupid thing is not healed yet, which is usual for me because this whole scenario happened once before. And she says another month with the boot and to do ultrasound treatments every day. And I forgot to do it. No, I did it yesterday.And she also told me that when I would be coming back the end of this month, she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else and of course she's following him. And nice thing about the visit is I really like that foot doctor as a person, and she's pregnant and she's going to have her second child. And I thought that was real nice. But anyway, I said well, since you're not going to be here in a month, I will get a foot doctor in Arizona. So that's where I am now.I'm waiting for this stupid foot to heal. The end."

So he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived, and they took the girl in and turned out they really didn't treat her like a regular family member, that this girl had to do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got everything they wanted. And she was sort of like their maid.And her name was then Cinderella because she spent a lot of time among the cinders by the fireplace and in the town. It came to pass that there was going to be a ball, and all the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball. So when they got the announcement, Cinderella knew about it. But of course, the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball, but she was going to make sure her daughters could go to the ball. So in preparation for the ball, as the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their thing, cinderella was among her little companions, who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house.And they saw how sad she was, and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such. But Cinderella, I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball. So as the day became closer, the stepsisters were getting ready to go. And they had beautiful dresses, and she had to help mend them. And let's see what happened.Um, she I guess she went out in the garden and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad and she was crying, and she really wanted to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother had said, you may go to the ball. Just she changed her troc into a beautiful dress, and she said, fetch me a pumpkin and turned it into a coach. And the three mice came and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin. And so she was able to go off to this ball.And when she got there, the ball was in full swing and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the prince. And unfortunately, as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people. And one had the tick and a creaky knee, and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just things that they just didn't know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way. And then when Cinderella came, all eyes turned to her and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince. And there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love.And they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting and suddenly the clock struck twelve and she realized she had to go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight. And with that she ran away. And in doing so, her glass slipper remained behind. She made her way home. She was a little sad because I guess she thought she'd never see this prince again.And then the prince found the slipper and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper. So he and his coachman, whoever they are, went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried had the slipper on. And they did come to the home where Cinderella lived. And the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on. Their foot wasn't going to fit.And then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe and it fits. And they get married and live happily ever after. And that was not the best version of the story I've ever heard."

        "transcript": "One day, Elliot was playing soccer by himself. He was practicing his soccer moves. He kicked the soccer ball accidentally, so hard, so high, that it went right into his neighbor Ralph's window, broke the window, went inside Ralph's house, knocked over the lamp that Ralph was sitting next to. So Ralph got up with the ball. He walked over to the window.He looked outside. There. He saw Elliot. Elliot had an embarrassed, embarrassed look on his face, and his head hung low. And Ralph remembered the time when he was little, and he had hit a baseball into his neighbor's yard and how embarrassed he felt.So rather than going outside and yelling at Elliot, ralph went outside, and he said, you know what? I did the same thing one day. Let's figure out how we can fix it together. And they did.So here is a series of pictures. Take a look at all of them, and then I'm going to ask you to tell me the story with the beginning, a middle, and an end. Again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.Okay? Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Ben, and he was getting ready to go to school. His mother said, Ben, it's going to rain today. You need to take the umbrella. And he said, no, I don't.I don't need an umbrella. She said, Ben, you need to take the umbrella. He said, Nope, I'm gonna go without it. Bye. So he started walking to school.And as he walked to school, it started raining a little bit. But he got to school, it was okay. But at the end of the day, he was walking home. It had been raining all day long. It was still raining.So on his way home, he was walking through puddles, getting poured on. By the time he got home, he was drenched. And his mother was very unhappy that he had not taken the umbrella. He said, I know. You were right.So the next day when he went to school, he took the umbrella and arrived at school nice and dry. So this first picture, look at everything that's happening, and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with the beginning, a middle, and an end.Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat named Spotty. And Spotty one day, went outside and climbed the tree, which very much upset the little girl, who had been riding her. And so she called her father, and her father got out the ladder and climbed up to go get Spotty, the cat. But the little girl and her father's dog, Barky, came along, and Barky knocked over the ladder.So then the father was trapped in the tree trying to get Spotty. And so the dog was barking so loudly that, I don't know, mom was inside, and she saw this happening from the window. So she called the fire department and the fire department. The firefighters came using their ladder and they got both dad and Spotty down from the tree. And everybody lived happily ever after."

She came in with two girls, so I'm guessing they were her daughter and a man was inviting them into his home.And he had a little girl, which is Cinderella. Ah. Then the guy disappeared.I wish I watched this movie. I'm going to say he died. He died or ran away. And the stepmother started treating her bad. They treated her like a servant.She would have to take them things. They would call, and she would just have to answer to them.From the picture, she seemed, like, really nice because it was like this little grumpy cat and the mice were trying to run from him, but she was trying to pet him and be nice and friendly.And then some guy came in. No, she was looking out of a window and it would look like a palace. So I'm guessing she was like, you know what? I wish I didn't live this life. I wish I could live in the palace, I guess.And the guy came in and he was inviting them somewhere because the lady the stepmother had, like, a little script, and the daughters were surrounding them, and they looked happy. So I guess they were getting invited.So I guess Cinderella got invited too, because she started looking for a dress. And she got a pink dress. And when she was on her way out, I guess the sisters ripped her necklace off. I guess they were being mean or jealous because she was pretty or something. But she went outside and was laying on a horse.I'm thinking that was and she met someone. Like she had a wand and she got dressed up and went to the party. And she got there and started dancing with some guy. And he must have been the Prince. He was a prince.And in the background, the clock was midnight. So guess she had a curfew and tried to run home. On her way, running down the stairs. She lost her shoe. Guess she didn't notice or was too scared to turn around.But she kept running and got to the house and the little mice were there with a key, I guess. Let her in before anyone noticed.Got in the house. Did she get yelled at? I don't think she got yelled at. I'm not sure. I Forgot.But in the end, one guy was looking for the person who lost her shoe. And her sisters were trying it on, but it didn't fit their feet. They tried it with her foot and it worked. And I guess the prince found his princess and it looked happily ever after."

        "transcript": "Okay, so the slides begin with the introduction of Cinderella's father to her future, or maybe even already married. Then welcome to your new stepmom and stepsisters. They aren't thrilled with her father dies, although that's not in the slide.The sisters are mean to her. She has to start cleaning, doing all the heavy lifting. In the meantime, she's befriended a bunch of animals and stares longingly at the castle where the prince lives. The king is looking for a suitor for his son to take over, and invitations go out, although that's not depicted either. Cinderella enlists the animals in helping her create a dress that she can wear, which is successful.But the relentless cruelty of the stepsisters are such that they tear the dress. They make it unwearable. So she's just kind of stuck, at which point she uncovers the secret, which I think was in the book of the fairy Godmother, who comes, gives her horse and carriage a brand new dress. She goes on to the ball. She and the prince have a really nice time.She has to leave by midnight because everything goes back. She leaves her shoe by accident. And even though when everything else reverts back to what it was, the shoe, for some reason, is not causing the prince to undertake a kingdom wide search for the owner of the shoe, they make it to Cinderella's house, at which time the stepmom and stepsisters work really hard to sabotage any attempt to have it fit anybody else's foot. But they fail. It fits on Cinderella's foot.They realize it's the same person, and she and the prince live happily ever after. From that point. Ask you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.How detailed do you want this? As detailed as you would like. Preferably more detailed than less detailed. But the rest this was an exercise I did in elementary school one time, so it was step by step. Like, start with, here are the ingredients you need to have.You need a jar of peanut butter, jar of jelly. You need at least two slices of bread and a butter knife. You unscrew the cap of the peanut butter. Use the butter knife to take some of the peanut butter and put it on one side of one slice of bread. You can put it on both sides, one side of both slices, but it wrong.So you put it on one side of one slice. You wipe off the blade on the clean slice. This is where your other stuff is going to go. Then you put the lid back on the peanut butter and put it away because you don't want to clean up later. Take the lid off the jelly, use the same butter knife, scoop out some of the."

        "transcript": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients that would include two slices of bread or one slice that you'd fold in half. Peanut butter and jelly with butter or margarine being optional, depending upon the individual's taste. Let's assume that you have two slices of bread. You then have to make a decision as to whether or not you're going to put butter on it or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly. Some people prefer that to put the peanut butter on the bread first, because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth.So, trying to satisfy as many people as possible, we're going to take a knife and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread, one slice or two, depending upon how much you want to fill the bread. And then we'll put the jelly on top of the peanut butter. Put the two pieces of bread together, and you are finished. After putting it on a plate and finding a napkin, little Jeannie came crying to her father, who was terribly upset. She said, Minnie is up in the tree and won't come down.And I'm afraid that she'll never come down and she can't come down. Come please help me. So Daddy, being the big hero type, went and got his ladder, and he climbed up the tree. And just as he stepped off the ladder, the ladder gave way and fell down. Now both Minnie the cat and dad were up the tree.Fido, the dog was barking, and they didn't know what to do. But the little girl remembered what she had learned at kindergarten. If there's a big, big problem, all you need to do is to push 911 on the telephone. So she ran in the house and pushed 911 and told the people that my daddy is up on top of the tree and he can't come down along with Minnie, my cat. And the 911 operator said, don't worry, little girl.Just go out and talk to your daddy and to your cat, and someone will be there to help right away. Well, she was just out there talking for just a minute when she heard the siren and a big fire truck pulled up in front of her house. And those wonderful firemen who not only put out fires, but they help kids and dads and cats and everyone came running with a different ladder, and they put the ladder up against the tree, and Daddy was able to get the Minnie the Cat and come down the ladder, and everyone was safe, and everyone was happy again. I have been fortunate to have had excellent health. I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade.I do remember that. And most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing. What I remember was the aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days and the nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic with recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures. But other than that, my life has been pretty free of physical difficulties."

It's a viral infection. There's not a whole lot you can do about it but to treat the symptoms.So I'm sure that I probably took some Advil and maybe some other over the counter meds, but that's about it. It was really just a matter of existing and enduring while it ran its course. And during that time, there was just a lot of lying around and showering.That was about it. There's not a great deal to it. Have you ever had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. All right.Tell me what the problems were and what you did about it. Well, my older son is on the autism spectrum, and so he's had a long history of communication difficulties, starting with being essentially nonverbal for two years, maybe three. I think at 18 months, he only had one word, which was cracker.So we got interventions for him, including a PEC system. We got a diagnosis. We put him in the developmental preschool through the public school and as a child at the IU Speech and Hearing Clinic preschool, as well as subsequently, until, I think, maybe his sophomore year of high school, he was enrolled in weekly speech therapy at IU Speech and Hearing, plus whatever speech therapy he had at school. So over the course of now 16 years, there have been a whole number of various interventions that we've used with Hunter to facilitate better communication. I really can't be any more specific than that because there have just been so many.So that's one area in which I've had issues with someone with difficulty communicating. My younger son had a brain tumor. And so after the resection of the tumor, he was unable to speak at all for four months, exactly four months of the day. And then he essentially had to relearn how to speak, swallow, really use any voluntary movement. So that was a challenge."

        "transcript": "Okay, well, Cinderella's father, who must have been a widower, decided to remarry to what became her stepmother, who had daughters of her own. Those daughters were very jealous of Cinderella. Cinderella was beautiful, and they made her become their servant and serve them food and tea and take care of them. She had to beat the tapestries. She had to make the meals.She had to do everything for them. Then along came the invitation to the ball. She knew that that palace was nearby and that she thought she was going to be invited. So she pulled out her book of how to make a gown, and she made a beautiful gown for herself, of which the sisters were not going to allow her to attend, and they tore up her dress. So the Fairy godmother decided that she would give Cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball.So I believe it was a pumpkin that turned to the coach. I believe that Gustas and friends became the horses, and she took the carriage. Oh, Fairy Godmother gave her a dress as well and did her hair, probably her nails and toes. So but she told her, you only have until midnight. So she attended the ball.The prince was gaga over her, and they danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight. She realized how dangerously close she was, and she ran down the stairs of the palace and lost one slipper. She got back, everything turned back to normal, the pumpkin and the mice. And I think Stepmom got suspicious about who that was at the ball that the prince had fallen in love with and locked her in a room. But Gus Gus and friends were able to get her the key.She got out. So when the palace guards came, she was able to try on the slipper, and they realized that it was her. I'll skip the part about cutting off the toes this time and all the stuff that they did to the stepmother, the stepdaughters. Okay, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.I would get out two pieces of bread. I would get out my peanut butter, and I would get out my jelly. And yes, it does have to be strawberry jelly. And I would get my knife out of the drawer. I would spread the peanut butter on one side, trying not to tear my bread minor on the peanut butter, not too much on the other side of the bread, which I think I said last week.You have to have one on one side, one on the other side. And I would spread my strawberry jelly, it is sugar free strawberry jelly. And I would spread that on the other side. I would get my Lay's potato chips, because you cannot do peanut butter and jelly without Lay's potato chips. I would pour some on the plate.I would put some inside the sandwich. I would put one slice of bread on the other slice of bread. I would cut the sandwich into halves and into."

And she has two daughters who she dots on, and they also are mean. And a father goes off on a business trip or something or other, and he dies. He doesn't return. So Cinderella is stuck with stepmother and two mean stepsisters, and she waits on the stepsisters, and no matter what she does, it isn't right.And Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince and I assume the king and queen live. And the prince is getting the prince is distressing his parents because he's getting up in age and he hasn't married, and they're telling him he has got to marry. So they throw a big ball, and invitations are sent to every house. And stepmother and stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they're going to go to. And Cinderella gets a lovely dress out of a trunk, and the stepsisters get all dressed, and Cinderella's helping them with everything, at least in this book.She gets a dress out of the trunk, but I've never seen that before. But anyway, she helps the girls, the ladies get dressed, and she, of course, is planning on going, but stepmother and stepsister say, no way. You cannot go. And so they leave, and Cinderella is in tears, and she's sitting by the fireplace in the cinders and so forth, and Fury Godmother comes along and tells us, asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball. And of course, Cinderella says yes, but she hasn't got any way to go, and she was told to stay home.But fairy godmother does her magic, and Cinderella has another lovely gown, and the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses. I think it's mice into horses, and somebody turns into, I guess, what you would call a coachman. And they take Cinderella to the ball, and she's the bell of the ball, and the prince is taken with her, and they're dancing and so forth. And then all of a sudden, it's almost midnight, which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she had to be back home because she would change back into old clothes and the coach would disappear and all that kind of thing. So she goes running away, and as she's running away, she drops a glass slipper, and she gets home.And then the prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits. And the wicked well, I'm not sure if they were wicked, but they sure were mean. Stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper, and of course, it didn't fit. And somehow he finds that Cinderella is there, and he tries a slipper on her, and it fits. And they get married, and they live happily ever after."

The man looked out the window holding the soccer ball as if he was going to either almost likely yell at the kid to kick it through the window. Okay, great. Thank you.Have you ever heard of the story Cinderella? Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to ask you to these pictures. Might help you remind you of it. Take a look at the pictures, and then I'm going to take the book away and ask you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words.Okay, but you can take a look through these pictures if you'd mean you don't have to.I realize you have two daughters. Doesn't really matter.Okay, go ahead. Okay, so there was a young woman who didn't have any parents, whose name was Cinderella. And Cinderella had to go to live with her evil stepmother and her three not so nice stepsisters. And the stepsisters just weren't very nice to her. And she snuck her way into a ball.And while she was at the ball, she had to be back by a certain time or she was going to turn into a pumpkin or something like that. But while she was there, she lost her glass slipper, but she danced with the prince. The prince loved her, was looking for the glass zipper. And eventually, in spite of her stepmother and evil stepsister's wishes, the prince eventually found her, and they lived halfway thereafter. Okay, great.Now moving on to something a little bit different. If I'd never made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tell me how you would make one. Okay.First I'd go into my pantry, and I'd get some bread. And then I take the bread and I put it on the counter. And I'd get the peanut butter out of the pantry also, and I get the jelly out of the refrigerator. And I would first spread the jelly because I wouldn't want the peanut butter to get into the jelly if I spread the peanut butter first. And then I would spread the jelly on one side, and I'd wipe it off by spreading whatever's left over on the other side.And then I'd spread the peanut butter very nice and neatly on the other side. I put it together and probably put it on a paper towel and bring it over here and eat it at the table. Thank you. Okay. So now I'm going to show you another picture.These pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them, and then I'm going to have you tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story the same as the other one. Okay, go ahead. So, looks like the little boy is refusing an umbrella.So mom said it looks like the mom's like, you need to take an umbrella because it's going to rain today. He said forget it, mom. He gets outside and realizes that his mother was right. So he runs back in and he's not too happy to admit his mother's right, but reluctantly takes the umbrella and goes about his way. Okay, thank you.So now, here is another story. Look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. Looks like a cat ran up a tree.Little girl real realized that it was her cat. She yelled to her dad to go rescue the cat. So the dad gets out the ladder, he climbs up the tree, and when he gets to the top, the ladder falls. And as a result, the dog who loves the dad starts barking very loudly and alerts neighbors who call firemen, who come and rescue the father and ultimately the cat."

So we had six prairie dogs among the three groups of us. Anyway, one of them was going out of the country and needed us to watch their prairie dogs, and so we did. And one of them was a male and he was a little aggressive and he didn't like me very much.And so I was trying to kind of calm him, pet him. Tina could pet him, my girlfriend could pet him, no problem. But he didn't like me very much. And so I was trying to pet him and I was rubbing his chin and he was getting all bristled up, and I really didn't read the warning sign very much. And he bit me and took out a good chunk of my middle finger, like, opened up a so I'm actually home alone, and I look down and I can see some of the bone and the fat in my finger.It's pretty good bite. And I realize, well, I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it. And I don't always do well with sight of my own blood. Like, I have no problem around other people. But I got all white faced and had to sit down for a while.And I'm like, oh, boy, what do I do? So ironically or funny, that Tino's actually swimming at ASU at the pool here. So I had to wrap my finger and drive just a mile or two down to ASU and interrupt her class and to get her to drive me to the urgent care, not the hospital for stitches. And so I was standing there when she came up out of the know, I'm standing there, I'm like, the prayer dog bit me. Can you drive me to the urgent care?And she's like."

No, I don't even like that you go to the store, you buy bread, peanut butter and jelly. They're two separate items bread, peanut butter, the jelly, depending on which one you like. Some people like strawberry. Some people like grape.You go home, you take two slices of bread, and on one side you would take a butter knife, grab a little measure of peanut butter, slide it on one side. You grab the jelly with the butter knife. You will put it on the other side of the bread and put it together. Cut."

I could feel it moving. It wasn't a muscle. I'm much sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle, it wasn't a bone. Something was really weird and it was moving.They were kidney stones. Eventually I found out, but I remember thinking, I don't have yet insurance here. And I've just moved back and I haven't been to a hospital here in 20 years. This is going to be really horrible. And I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where I had a fever of 101 or something.And it just was doubled over and couldn't even really stand as the thing was making its way down. So we went to the hospital and the first thing I walked in is I said, I'm sorry to bring you a bad news. And the woman said, Why did my husband die? That's the receptionist. And I said, that's a good joke, but anyway, I don't have insurance.And she said, that's no problem, you're going to get come on in. And I remember thinking, okay, this is going to be all right. 3 hours later, after some medicine and vomiting at least 40 times because of the intense pain, the most intense pain I've ever had in my life. Just imagine like stones going through that little opening. Sorry.Suddenly and I was having these little strainer thing and seeing them come out. And then for about a day, the blood and everything else. But I was amazed. The body. Once they told me what it was, I read a little bit about it and realized it's not such a simple thing.And how often we don't realize it. So water people drink colas and coffees. Colas bubble gas drinks are the worst. And then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested. So I learned.And I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital, and I was vomiting so much and it wasn't even vomit, I thought my throat's going to come out because the convulsions were so strong. And I just remember thinking, my wife and son are coming next week. And oh, my God, here I am in the hospital. So I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it for the first time in my life ever. Not death, but enough to the point where something's seriously wrong here.That was the point of my story. I never."

Meanwhile, at the castle, prince is being badgered by his OD looking father that he must have a wife to be princess so that the evil patriarchy can continue on through history of the rule of the land. The prince is going to have a big party and invite all the eligible young women in the land that is, all the women of the proper class and race, creed, religion and all the other important things to a prince. So a declaration is set out. There is going to be a great ball from which at which occasion, the prince will observe and perhaps dance with all the hopefully eligible young women of the nation.And as this happens, the unfortunate nice daughter learns of it and thinks maybe she could go. And in an old chest she finds an old book which may not have anything to do with the story, but she also finds a great dress that she can wear. Now, the evil daughters, they see her thinking that she has plans to go and they say, no, you're not going to go. You're just the ugly daughter who does all the chores and you're not going to go to a great ball. So they and the unpleasant mother head off to the ball to have a great time and hopefully attract the prince's attention and have things go their."

And I remember laying there on this delivery table with it was May, and there was this lovely spring breeze blowing in through the door. And I know that sounds like a strange way to remember this, but it was so unique because you'd never oh, my God.Never find that today. But it was really an interesting experience to be in a delivery. And I'm a nurse, so, I mean, yeah, that seemed even stranger, but it was quite delightful. It was almost like having a home birth, only in a hospital setting with everybody and everything you needed there. But anyway, it was a very special day.First child is always a very special experience.Here's another series of pictures that tell a story. Whenever you're ready, please tell me this story. All right. We have a boy probably in his backyard playing soccer, practicing, and he kicks the soccer ball, and it goes through a window. We don't know if it's his home or his neighbor's home, but it goes through the window, breaks the glass, and not only does it break the glass, it knocks over a lamp, probably breaks it, too.And there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and lamp falling over. And he gets up and goes to the window holding the ball. And that's all I can see. I think that's all he's looking at the window to see who's kicked the ball.Here's another set of pictures that tell a story. Whenever you're ready, please tell me this story. Okay. In this story, mom is sending her little boy off, I'm guessing to school, because he has a backpack, and she wants him to take the umbrella. And he is a know it all.And, oh, no, I don't need the umbrella. It's going to be fine until he gets to the third picture. And it starts raining, and it's raining, and there's puddles of the downpour. He's getting soaked. So he turns around and goes home.And mom looks at him rather sternly, almost like you deserve it. And the next picture, the end of it, he sets off for school again. This time, he took Mother's advice and has the umbrella. Thank you. So here is a picture which you have definitely seen.I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and then tell me the story. Okay. In this picture, it appears that we have a cat, that the dog chased up the tree, because the dog is still barking, and the cat is out on a limb, and there's a little girl trying, holding her arms up, hoping to catch the cat. Her tricycle is in front of her, and there's a ladder on the ground. And dad, apparently dad is up the tree.And I am guessing that dad got a ladder and climbed up the tree to try to get the cat and the dog probably knocked the ladder down. But that's not for sure. But the ladder got knocked down. So now we have cat and dog or cat and dad stuck in the tree. And someone has called the fire department.There's a fire truck parked out on the street. And we have two firemen running towards the tree with a ladder to resolve everything. And there is one other detail. Net. There's a bird on one of the branch."

I'm going to go ahead and mute myself, and then I'll give you the prompt, and then I'll mute myself. Okay. And here we go. These are great childhood stories.So I was in the fourth grade, I think, and I sat the desk in front of me. A little boy in my class, his name was Lynn Fuller sat in front of me, and one day he turned around and said to me, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you four times. And I'd never heard that word before, but he said it with some kind of anger. So I just sat there and took it, went home. And I got in a fight with my older brother who was always picking on me.And he kind of terrorized me, actually. But we're having some kind of fight with a window. Either he was trying to open it or I was trying to keep it closed or vice versa, I don't remember. But he was going to overpower me, and I could sense that. And so I said I repeated the same words to him and he said, oh, you're going to get in so much trouble.And he screamed, Mom, Mary just said the dirtiest word in the whole world.So anyway, that's my know he continued to be he started to become just I became like his picking point for walking home. He'd throw things at me and he was a bully. Not a terrible bully, but a bully. I was scared of him, and he was on my walk home. Back when kids used to walk to school.But anyway and so once again, these pictures tell a little story. So please take a look at them and then tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end. Little boy oh, sorry. Oh, I hate Cinderella.Okay, we'll stick with this one first. Begin. It's more fun when they're new. Anyway, a young child is playing practicing soccer in a yard, and he hits the ball through the window and end. The ball crashes through the window and onto an unassuming man's lap.Well, the lap is not unassuming. The man's unassuming. He's sitting there on the couch. And this ball comes crashing through the window and lands on his lap. And the man stands up to see where the ball came from."

It started to rain even harder and harder, and puddles were forming.So he ran home. Mom, not very happy that he was all wet, scolded him. And he took the umbrella and walked, changed his clothes, took the umbrella and walked back to school. All right. When Cinderella was a young girl, her father remarried and brought home her stepmom and her two stepdaughters.Soon after he remarried, her father died, and her wicked stepmother made her do all the cooking and the cleaning, and she became the maid, and she was forced to sleep outside with the animals. Okay, what happens next? As she's cleaning, she looks outside the window and she looks at the castle, wondering one day when her prince is going to come. Inside the castle, the king was talking to his first in command about how his son needed to get married. It was time for him to start taking over the throne.So the king decides to announce that there's going to be a ball where the prince is going to be able to meet all the eligible young girls in the kingdom. Cinderella is told if she gets if all of her chores are done, then she can go to the ball. But she has nothing to wear. So she goes upstairs and she realizes that she has an old chest with her mom's old dress and some other things.Because she has so many chores, she's not able to actually fix up her dress. So while she is working, the animals that she has befriended make the dress for her. And as she is getting ready, her stepsisters see that she's coming downstairs looking very pretty. So they all rip up her dress, and then they take off. As she's crying, her fairy godmother comes and turns the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into footmen and a horse and take her to the ball.When she arrives at the ball, the prince decides he wants to dance with her and falls madly in love with her. But she has to remember that her fairy godmother told her that she has to be home by the stroke of midnight, because that's when the spell will disappear. So as she is dancing, she hears the bells ring. And so she takes off running, and she loses one of her glass slippers. The prince wants to know her name, and she never tells the prince anything, just leaves the glass slipper.While she is driving home in the coach, the clock strikes finally twelve, and everybody turns back into a pumpkin. She turns back into Cinderella with her torn clothes, but she has the one glass slipper. Then the prince and the king decide that they want to find the girl with the glass slipper. They go around and they look for everybody who they can possibly find. The wicked stepmother.She locks Cinderella into a closet, and when the princes assistant comes and asks to see if there's any girls in the house besides stepsisters, she says no. But the animals give Cinderella a key, and she comes downstairs. As the man goes to walk and put this shoe on cinderella, the wicked stepmother trips him, however."

So they were called the evil stepsisters. And so the mom put Cinderella to work while the girls just got to do whatever they wanted. Cinderella had to serve them tea and bring them whatever they needed and do all the housework. And she never complained.And she just did it with, made it friends with all the little animals. And she just went along her merry way until one day the mom got a letter saying there was going to be a ball because I think the king or the prince needed to find a wife.

So she went back to her room and she got out of her chest of stuff and she got her dress out and she hung it up and her and the birds helped her make a beautiful dress.And she got all ready. And at the same time the stepsisters were getting all ready. And when they all met to go to the ball, the stepsisters started ripping her dress and breaking her necklace and saying, you're not going to go. So the mom said, you can't. And so the girls went off the stepsisters and went to the ball.And Cinderella was sad and her fairy godmother appeared and she did her little magic with her wand and made a carriage to take Cinderella into the ball. But before that, she did her magic and gave her a beautiful white gown and some glass slippers to wear. So Cinderella got in the little carriage. She made it out of a pumpkin and went to the ball. But the one thing was, she had to be back by midnight.And if she wasn't, that's when everything was going to go back to what it was like, her whole ripped dress and the carriage would be gone. So she was at the ball dancing with the prince, and she all of a sudden realized it was midnight and the clock started chiming and she ran. And when she was running down the steps to get to her carriage, one of her glass slippers fell off. So she got in the carriage and it went back home. And then poof.She was with the animals in her old rip dress and she went back to her house. And then the next day, someone from the castle came with the glass slipper because they wanted to find who the shoe fit. And the stepsisters had huge feet and they wouldn't fit into the glass slipper. And they did not want Cinderella to try it on but she did, and the glass slipper fit her. So they took her to the castle to be with the Prince and they lived happily ever after."

And so in New York it was know, you don't trust anybody, you don't go with any know everybody's bad. In New York, we had the completely different view. California, california was like this fantasy know, awesome place to be. You can trust everybody, and everybody loves everybody.So when we moved here, when we moved to California from New York, I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you. And one time this man stopped and he was like, do you need a ride? And it was one of those days where the evening was coming and the bats were like flying around, and I was like, oh my gosh, I was so scared. Am I going to make it home? These bats are so it was like a godsend when he know, I was like, oh, okay, and get a ride, and I'll have to deal with these bats.And I'm thinking, well, and everybody where I'm in California, so person can't possibly do me wrong. So I get in the car and I'm driving, and it's like, how are you and what's your name and where do you live?Then it just started getting weird when I said, make a right. And he said, Well, I'm going to make a left. And I'm like, no, go right. And then that's when I was like, okay, something's wrong here. So I just prayed at that point that he would go right, go towards my house.And he's like, you sure you don't want something to drink? I'm like, no, just please just go right. And so he turned right, and then I said, here's my street, please turn and anything. I didn't know what was going to happen at that point. He pulled up in front of my house, and he was still kind of rolling, and I just kind of opened the door and just kind of jumped out of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house and nobody was home.So then I'm knocking on the door and the sun's going down, and I'm like, oh gosh, what if he's just still right there waiting for me? So when I thought he was gone, I ran over to my neighbor's house, which is my best friend's house at the time, and stayed there until I knew my mom was home.Flooding began in Arizona this past weekend, and it flooded one of the one of the streets and one of the washes overflowed. And a little girl was playing in the park where one of the washes are, and she got pulled into the current. She started yelling for help. And they called the local, I don't know, fire department, and they came with all their gear and tried to figure out how they could get to her, and one of the firemen was able to jump into the water and grab onto a branch and pull the girl to safety."

So the firefighters came with their ladder, and they're rushing to the scene so they can rescue both the dad and the cat from the tree. So I'm going to have you look at these pictures that tell a story. There's going to be several slides that are just the pictures of the story. They are automatically going to advance after 30 seconds.But if you're ready to move on before 30 seconds, just say, next, and I'll go to the next slide. At the end, there will be an opportunity for you to review any slides if you wish to have extra time to look at any slides. And then I'm going to stop sharing my screen with you and have you retell the story of Cinderella without looking at the pictures. Okay, so we can go ahead and start. Just say next if you're ready to move on.Next.Next.Next.All right. Do you want to go back and review any pictures or slides? No, thanks. All right, so now tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can. You can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it.Okay. So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away, and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters. But they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her, as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked Cinderella to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did.So one day, they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess. And the stepsisters were very excited about it, and so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and stepsister said, oh, well, you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years. And it was a beautiful dress, and she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball.And when her stepsister saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried, and the stepsisters went off to the ball, and along came Cinderella's fairy godmother. And she said, oh, well, you can go to the ball. And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters. And Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to all.She danced with the Prince and had a wonderful time but remembered that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were.Sorry. That was my."

And she wakes up and they get married, and they go off and live happily ever after.That was awesome. It it like any sane person would do. Yeah, any sane person. You see a sleeping girl, nothing else works. I mean, you kiss her, if one of two things are going to happen, she's either going to wake up and slap you well, one of three things wake up and slap you.Wake up and just say, whoa, what happened? Or just not wake up at all. You got three options. Two of them are good. The third one, it's a little rough, but no worse off than it was before.Exactly. Didn't hurt anything.Okay. So now I'm going to have you do the same thing with Little Red writing.Just a nice home where all right. And so remember, you can use anything that you remember as well as the pictures from the book to tell the story. All right? So Little Red Riding Hood's at her house with her mom, and her mom's baking some muffins and bread and some snacks for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her granny. So she's out playing with the animals while her mom's doing that.And then she gets the basket from inside, and she's like, okay, well, I'm off to Granny's. Well, while she's going off to her grandmother, she gets a little sidetracked playing with the animals, and she runs into this wolf. And wolf's like, hey, where are you going? She's like, Well, I'm going over here to my granny's house. I got a basket full of goodies for.So, like, the wolf goes over and looks in the basket, and she's like, hey, leave that alone. That's not for you. And so the wolf's like, if I get there first, maybe I can get these goodies. So the wolf runs on ahead and gets to Granny's house and knocks on the door. And Granny comes and answers the door, and it's a wolf.So, I mean, she runs off. She's scared. Well, the wolf's like, I have an idea. And so he dressed up in one of Granny's nightgowns and put on a sleeping cap and grabbed her glasses and crawled into the bed. And Little Red Riding Hood gets to the door and knocks, and the wolf disguises its voice.It's like, Come on in, sweetie. Little Red Riding Hood's like, okay, Granny. And she opens the door and sets the basket down, and she's like, Granny, are you feeling okay? Yeah, sweetie. And so she goes a little bit closer."

        "transcript": "Let me talk about when I went to Belgium as a cultural exchange student, which was, I would say, kind of life changing. When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio, and I had the opportunity to travel as part of the International Foreign Youth Exchange, which is a four H associated organization. I was big in four H when I was young because I grew up in Ohio, so grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity.Ohio, the state of Ohio sends several people every year to go to a foreign country, and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others. And it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up, so I always knew that I wanted to do that. And since I had taken French all through high school, I thought, oh, well, go to a French speaking country. And France wasn't available, but Belgium was, so I chose Belgium, and luckily I got to go there.I soon found out that learning high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium, so it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English, so I had to learn French, and that's the best way to learn it, I think. But when I say it was life changing, it really kind of made me think about, first of all, that other people are not like us in the United States, and really got me thinking about how can I do what I do as a speech pathologist in other countries?So I immediately came home and interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist. And they said, well, you got to get your master's degree back then you didn't have to have your master's degree in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my master's and met my husband, got married, had children, that kind of thing. But it's always been something. I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full time professor and did a lot of international work that way.So I was doing telepractice before it was cool, actually, and got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and that kind of thing. So still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. I still keep in touch with some of my host families in Belgium, and we've hosted kids from other countries for other programs as think, and I always encourage my children.I hope they will get to, if not study abroad, then travel a little bit more than I did growing up. It just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it. Now, these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them. Tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end.And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard, and all of a sudden, he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through, and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face. Take a look at these pictures that tell a story.I'll ask you to tell me a story also with a beginning, middle, and end, and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mother said, oh, you definitely need to take your umbrella to."

        "transcript": "So, once upon a time, there was a very wicked lady who had three daughters, and one day, her husband, I think, adopted or brought in a new child into the household. And the sisters or the three sisters did not like this new child. And they commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and tasks and do their laundry and sweep the floors. But she consoled herself in her friendship with animals. And be it horses or dogs or even mice, she was very friendly to animals.What love she didn't get from her sisters or the sisters in the household. She got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks. Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold a ball. And the household was invited to the ball. So Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited.But her sisters told her differently. And furthermore, they told her that she was not only not invited, but she was not appropriately dressed or did not have a dress that would suit the occasion. So they left for the ball. And Cinderella was very sad. But here comes the fairy, the godmother fairy, and says, what would you like to do, my child?And she says, I would like to go to the So, but I don't have a dress. And the fairies said, no problem. We're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand. And Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes. Not only that, but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball.So she goes to the ball and impresses everybody, including the prince, the king's son, who falls desperately in love with her. But the fairy had said you must be back by midnight or you're going to turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella hurries back and makes it back before midnight, but leaves behind a shoe. So the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry. But where was she?She was nowhere to be seen. So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe. And they had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfectly. And they went through the sisters. And even the mother tried her luck, but the shoe would not fit.And so no candidate was found to marry the prince until one of the animals told the surveyor that she should try it on cinderella. And when the surveyor did that, the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly. So the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball and they lived happily ever after. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.So you get two slices of bread."

        "transcript": "In the beginning of the story, cinderella and her father were moving to a new house, and he was getting a new wife who would be Cinderella's stepmother. Her stepmother had two little girls that were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat, and Cinderella had a dog, and Cinderella thought everything could be good. And her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up, the stepsisters really were not nice to Cinderella.They were evil stepsisters. They did things like they made her do all the chores, then throw things at her, then make her clean the floors, clean the cinders out of the fireplace, then make her take care of all the animals, including their cat. And their cat didn't like Cinderella, so that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were mice. So that was kind of a tough thing to do. Cinderella obviously was sad.So every night she would go to her room and she'd look out her window and she could see in the distance, she could see the palace. And she looked at the palace and says, oh, I wish I could go there someday just to see what it's like. So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king and his right hand man would go through and try to figure out what was needed, because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well, he had a son who was a prince, but the prince did not have a wife, and he wanted the prince to have a wife before he would give him the kingdom.So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the village. And they sent out invitations to everybody. And the stepmother got the invitation and was reading it, and Cinderella read it over her back, over her shoulder. And Cinderella thought, well, I'm a girl in the village. I get to go.And her stepmother didn't say anything, but her stepsisters were, no way. You can't go. Got to have a ball gown. So she did her ball gown. She didn't have a ball gown, that is so she went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of ball gowns that she could have.And she talked to her friends, the mice, and they took a dress that she had, and they put bows and frills on it and things like that and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need. I can go now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave.And when they saw her dress, they were upset. One of the stepsisters ripped her dress, and one of them ripped her necklace off of her. And of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset."

        "transcript": "And no eight thinks to herself, yep, I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all. And she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite.And then she collapses. And the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm going to be real. The first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. I can only get a wedge out, and then from there, I can take proper bites.But apparently Snow white has awesome jaw strength as well as in human beauty. So anyway, she collapses, the apple rolls out of her hand, the crone cackles maniacally, as you are, want to do, and runs out. And then I assume she like hobbles out because she's still a crone. Maybe she turned no, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway.But anyway, the old crone hobbles away, and all the dwarves come hi hoing home, and they see Snow white pass out on the floor, and they're like, again, but then they realize that she's not breathing too well or at all. And so they get on the backs of deer, I think. Like they ride deer to go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this crone. Presumably, she just leaves a really obvious trail, but they follow her and I don't know, there's a lightning storm or something, I think, and the crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer.Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her, and they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car, specifically. And I believe it. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying.But anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded men riding them. And so she's understandably freaked out. And she climbs up onto this mountain, and she's trying to hang onto the edge because she's about to fall. And then lightning strikes the stick she's holding onto and the ground beneath her feet crumbles and she falls, presumably to her death, but probably not for sure in case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development.They did that in Rapunzel in Tankbold lubicopt's probably dead. I hope she's dead. She was scary. So the evil queen as the crone falls to her death, and all the dwarves were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on Snow white.And so they race back to Snow White, but she is still dead. And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical. Again, but this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin, and they're mourning her, and there are flowers and tears and furry wildebeests crying. And suddenly the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion and he says, what the heck?The pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm going to kiss her, because that is the logical next step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her and she wakes up. I assume she like, just hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple and took it out of her mouth and that was censored.That seems logical, because if he's going to kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Good luck or go home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so she sits up and thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her, because otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again, because she does that a lot."

And then one day, her dad remarried and brought a new mom with two stepsisters home to meet Cinderella and was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom. Well, Cinderella and her dad really loved each other, and they were a family again with a new mom and two stepsisters. But then Cinderella's dad died, and the stepmom was not a very nice mom, and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella.And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes and scrub the floor and make the beds and make the food, and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family. And they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there. And she would look out her window, and she could see far beyond the city, the castle.And she would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would want to go and see. Well, meanwhile, there was the prince, and the prince wasn't married yet. And the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom. And so they decided to do a ball, which is a big dance, and they were going to make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in the town come to the ball.

And so the stepmother and the two stepsisters, they were so excited to go to this dance, and they were going to dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family, too. And the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you.You're shabby, and you don't have any clothes to wear. And the stepmother said, if you do all your chores, you can go. And, oh, Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball. And so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball. And so they made her a dress, and, oh, it looks so pretty.So the night of the ball, cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball. And they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done. And here comes Cinderella, and she comes down the stairs and she goes, oh, wait for me. I can go, too. And the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her and they were appalled.They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear. And they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her and they cinderella, you can't go. Look at you.You look like a little merchant and no prince would ever want to look at you. And so they said they were off to the ball."

        "transcript": "Okay, so the story of Cinderella is that her mom died and her dad remarried this really mean woman who had these really terrible daughters. And so they all move in together. And I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean woman wouldn't be marrying him. But when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really meet Cinderella. So Cinderella is she's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do.And so she's pretty much a slave. Again, I don't know where the dad is during all this. So she works for a long time because in the story it showed her as a little girl and then later on it's like eight years later. So apparently this happened for a long time. This girl is going to need some help.So she is still working for the family. And then she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time. And then there's that castle and she's like, oh, where other people live who I'm sure have a great life. So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife. I don't know, this sounds very crazy as I'm saying it, but it's true.So they have this dance so that the prince could find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently again her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants. But her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come. But she thinks she's going to come. So she gets to try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that, help her get ready.And then the stepsisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book they take her necklace and tear her dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top. But they do and they're really mean and so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out.I don't know if she rubs a lamp in there. Maybe she read a book. I don't remember that part. But anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So she asks her fairy godmother, I guess, to go to the dance.I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. This is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that one night is going to help. But anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So very godmother gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up and then puts her in a pumpkin, sends her away.So she gets to go to the dance. And it looks like she had a nose job. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much, much smaller and her hair is much, much blonder when she goes to the dance. So something happens and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance. And lo and behold, the prince falls in love with her.And so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess, are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off, which the last shoes anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken them off 15 minutes after getting there. So she lost her shoe. And then all the prince knows is that girl that he loves wore this shoe.So he said, sends his lackey guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe. And it's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this."

They had to call the fire department to come and rescue to him while the dog's barking up the tree at father and the father's ladder is laying on the ground where it should be up against a tree.When I had my heart attack we lived up at Roosevelt Lake and I knew I was having something when I was out in the garage putting our stuff away we had brought back from Alpine and I was storing it in the garage and I went in and my left side felt like it was going to explode. And I told my wife, I said, Call 911. So she did and if this luck would have it, the ambulance was only five minutes away. So they got there and started work and they were talking to doctors and their headquarters and I heard the doctor say, don't try to bring him in the ambulance, we're sending a helicopter out. So they said you got a good place so you meet it on top of the hill with Mr.Ramsey and the ambulance. So they said okay. So they loaded me in the ambulance, and it was only about half a mile to the top of the hill. And they just had got there when a helicopter landed. And they loaded me on the helicopter and flew me in the globe.And they stabilized me in a globe. And my family doctor was there and he asked me, he said, do you have a cardiologist? I've never needed one. Said okay, said I'll get one, so just wait just a minute. He went back and he called this cardiologist and made an appointment for him to meet the helicopter at the emergency room door when they landed and they did.And when they unloaded me off the helicopter at Good Samaritan Hospital well he was there and he said, okay, we'll take him from here. So they took me in and started checking me over and I heard him say, yes, he has a major heart attack. And they started performing angioplastic surgery on me so they could put a stent in the block. So they went up both sides and as they was going up I heard the anesthesia geologists say, we've lost him. And that's when I had visions of what it would be like if I really died."

And the man is has a map in his hand.And the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree. Well, it's clear the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is. The farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story. And then he begins pointing in the direction that the cars headed. Off they go.We see them receding into the distance. The farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole. And suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer. It looks like they just went around in a circle.Who knew he was digging hookup a few minutes later how is the weather? Looks pretty sunny. Clear to me.Take a minute to look at it. When you're ready, tell me a story. Beginning, middle and the end.Yes, I can do that. Whenever you finish.Oh, does this pick up that a little bit. Okay. We don't care, do we? Yeah, I'm going to get out of here. No, we'll go ahead.Okay. Yeah. We have here setting in the living room, which is clearly a little boy's birthday party.

And what we see first is beautiful birthday.On the table we have the front door open and a little boy and little girl are coming in, obviously their guests, and they're carrying presents, each one accompanied by the mother. And they all stop and they look at the cake. Well, there's a big chunk taken out of the cake and one of the candles looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count. Then when you look like paw prints, the paw prints go across the table onto the rug and you follow the paw prints under the sofa. And there's a puppy dog looking very guilty, peeking out from under the sofa.Now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry mama who is brandishing a broom, clearly threatening the puppy, thinking that he was the cause of this little boy is crying. Doesn't look like because it leaves it right there that there she is. Everybody. He's unhair."

        "transcript": "The game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other. And points in the sport are called runs.The way that the playing field is set up is there's a diamond and there's four bases at each point of the diamond. The diamond is on one point and such that the bottom point is called home plate. And then going counterclockwise around the clock, there's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate.The team that is in the field and on defense, they're allowed to have gloves and there's a ball that is in play. The other team that is trying to score the runs at that point has a bat and they have some protective equipment, including helmets and such. The way that the game starts is one team is on defense. So they take the field and there's certain positions for each player. There's nine active players per side.So the defensive team has nine players out in the field. The offensive team has one bat player that starts at home plate and he's called the batter. The team that is in the field first is the visiting team to the stadium. The home team, I take it back. The visiting team backs first.The home team is on the field first. The way that the game is set up, there are nine, what are called innings. And an inning consists of where each team gets to bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs and then they switch sides, where the home team then comes to bat and the visiting team then is in the field. And then they get three outs.Once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning. And you do nine of those sets. In the defensive position, there's several different positions. There's nine positions. One of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher.And then at home plate is the catcher. And then we go around. We go have a first baseman, a second baseman, a third baseman. There's someone that stands between third and second base, called a shortstop. And then beyond the diamond is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out their goal.The defensive goal is to there's two ways you can make an out. You can catch the ball in the fly, actually three ways. Make it out now catch the ball in the fly. If the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate, the batter hits it. If the batter hits the ball and someone in the field catches it for hits the ground, that is one out.There's something called balls and strikes where if the batter misses with his bat and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the actual physical base. At home plate, that's called a strike. If it's outside that lateral movement, it's called a ball. You get three strikes or the batter is out, or if you get four balls, then the battery gets a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out.If the batter makes it to first base before the throw gets there, he is safe on first base."

So Cinderella did spend a lot of time with the animals outside, beside working, sweeping up Cinders and cleaning the house and doing things for her stepsisters, who seemed to spend a lot of time on their looks, looking in the mirror and fixing themselves up. One day, they all had an invitation from the Prince to go to a ball at the castle. So of course, Cinderella was not going to be allowed to go.She didn't have the clothes to do it. But the ugly stepsisters were dressed up and the stepmoma was too, and they all left for the ball. Cinderella was sad, but she accepted it. And along came her fairy godmother. And her Fairy Godmother brought out her magic wand and tapped different things.Pumpkin turned into a coach and the mice turned into, I don't know, Carriagemen. I don't know what they're called. And Cinderella had a beautiful gown and pretty glass flippers. And then they all went to the ball. And the only stipulation was that at midnight, she would have to return to her Cinderella state.So she went to the ball and the Prince and Cinderella danced. And he was very taken with her, with not only her beauty, but her manners. She was a very sweet person. And she looked up at the clock and the clock was getting ready to strike midnight, so she ran down the stairs and lost one of her slippers, her glass slippers, and returned to her house, where she was again quiet in her old clothes. And the Carriagemen returned to their mice and Pumpkin status.And when her stepmama and stepsisters came home, they were raving about the ball that they had gone to. And Cinderella didn't say that she had gone, so she went back to her normal life. In the meantime, the Prince was trying to find Cinderella. She had disappeared so rapidly and he wanted to be able to see her again. So he sent out on a search for her with his manservants.And they came to I don't know what her stepmother's name was, but they came to their home. And the ugly stepsisters, of course, thought that they would fit into the glass slippers. And whoever did was going to, of course, be part of the Prince's life, so they couldn't fit into it. And he went out and Cinderella was outside and he stopped to try it on Cinderella. Lo and behold, the slipper fit.So Cinderella and the Prince were married and went away from the stepmother and stepsisters and lived happily ever after."

The Story of Cinderella once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a young girl whose parents had died. She had an aunt, but her aunt was a very bitter person, so she and the children, her children, her daughters were living in the house.But Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid. She had to keep the house cleaned up, no matter what. As she grew older, she grew more and more beautiful. But even as beautiful as she was, she was still just the housemaid.The other girls grew up. They weren't near as beautiful as she was.In the meantime, the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married. And to do that, he wanted to have a great ball. He sent out invitations to all the influential people within the land that they could attend the ball. Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation and had decided to send her two daughters. Cinderella said, well, can I also go?And her mother said, no, you can't. You're to stay here and keep this place clean.So while she was doing that, she became a little bit disconcerted. And all at once, she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball, because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard. All at once, her fairy godmother came to see her, and she asked what she really wanted. And she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball. So her fairy godmother waved her wand and gave her the most beautiful dress and a tierra and glass slippers to wear to take her off to the ball.She had to have a coach.So she went into the garden, and there was a pumpkin."

This can be a happy story, sad from any time childhood up until more recently.Just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about. And you can take time to think, if you'd like. I was going to say, because I'm going to try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injury stories. What wasn't important?As soon as I hang up from you, I'll go, Why didn't I tell her that? What is important?Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things is my daughter's gallbladder, because I haven't had too many injuries or life stopping moments as I have when that hit last January and she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU health that went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so and oh, my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that. I'm not sure who was going to bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work.She had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to, I guess Jackie was still there at that point, and Mark. And when I called her, she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the Er, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get intravenous. Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth if that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not.And Mark did take her to the Er. They did release her. It wasn't long after that. IU then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying.And then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know that they need you. So it was a decision whether to hop a plane that night, and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie. It was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day and we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was our chauffeur for the entire time we were in the doctor's office.And he admitted her into the hospital for that night and the surgery was the following night.I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night, which I was glad that I did, because she was with it, but not really with it, but staying there with her for a few days afterwards, she was a trooper. But none of my children have really been sick. So to be so far away and not be able to be there immediately all turned out good. But as you know, there's still issues."

So she got her dad to climb the tree and get the kitty, who was way out on the end of a branch. The ladder had been knocked over.The fire department came running with their ladder to try and help. Little bird is chirping away like nothing had all happened. So a couple of weeks ago, Jesus Christ Superstar was coming to town, and my daughter got excellent tickets for she and I to go just kind of front and center in the orchestra pit. And it came out during my teenage years, so I taught myself the music. I was really looking forward to this.Well, in the meantime, this is just after Easter. My granddaughter that our whole extended family lived together, and she had gotten the stomach flu. A couple days later, her mom, my oldest daughter, got it. And lo and behold, the day that we had tickets for Jesus Christ Superstar, I got this stomach virus. And you didn't know you had it until you were losing things from your body, and it just knocked you completely for a loop.So I was already mad enough being sick, but to miss was even worse. Oh, yeah. I laid in bed and about 715, 15 minutes after it started, I was feeling a whole lot better. But, yeah, there was couldn't go could not go to the plane. And then by morning, I was back to work.Just a day deal. Not even quite 24 hours.That was my last illness. Yes. My youngest daughter, and this was a year ago, she was a senior in high school and quite an athlete. And it was track season, and she's a good runner, a good high jumper. And we were at a meet that had kind of old equipment, and she did her high jump and the mat spread and she fell, landed on her back, legs up over her head, was cocked up, and it just was too much for me.I'm fine, I'm fine. The next day, I took her to a chiropractor that we know, and she kept saying she was fine, and apparently with this injury, she was. But that next day, then after he had kind of adjusted her and said, everything really, truly is fine, she got very ill and she wound up having mono. And it was the worst case. The pediatricians and the chiropractor said they had seen in many, many years.I've never seen I don't know any children that have had cancer, so I'm not trying to compare it with that because you do get over this. But I've never seen one of my kids that ill, that sick. They didn't think she'd graduate, let alone get back to track or even start ASU in the fall. She was down and just the pain, you get all this stuff in your neck and just swollen, going like Frankenstein. It was very, very scary.But I credit well, God and the chiropractor, he did a lot of immune stuff and and she did graduate. She was able to finish school.

        "transcript": "The last big selling adventure.It's not all that important, but in 2011 was the last time it we had the opportunity to go on a sailing trip in Caribbean. I was in the Bahamas, this time with friends from the sailing club, and we met well, the month of February is broken into 310 day shifts where people would meet at the boat, and a few people were there for the whole month because they were retired and had enough time and money to do it. But the rest of us were there for ten day periods and we met the boat at Paradise Atlantis, paradise Island Resort in Nassau in the Bahamas. We were on the boat for ten days, and by the time we got back, I mean, by the time our time was over, we were back in Fort Lauderdale where the boat had been rented, and it was a real fun trip. We did a lot of snorkeling.The water is just absolutely beautiful, and most of the Bahamas, the water is only about less than 20ft deep. So as you're sailing to the next place and we didn't always know where we're going to drop anchor and hang out for the night, sometimes in just some totally uninhabited area, or sometimes near an island where it could go to shore and explore the shore and go to a restaurant.I've been on other trips like this before, but this one was really good. It was a catamaran, which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between and got into some storms at night where we were just bouncing around like crazy all night.Ah, we ate a lot, drank a lot, snorkeled a lot, got a lot of great underwater pictures, barracudas and things.The very last night of the trip, me and the captain, this is the guy who we'd all met at our Salem Club when he was living in Bloomington working on a journalism degree. Then he moved back to Florida and he arranged us renting the boat for the month. And he'd grown up in Florida and the Bahamas and knew the area pretty well, but was also a real character.He was like in his 30s going on twenty s at one of the people because he was kind of goofy. You never know what to expect from him. He's kind of not grown up in some ways, but he was also about 62 with Scandinavian looking with blonde hair and blue eyes, except his hair was in dreadlocks.And Hesso had some history of of smuggling people and smoke and booze and stuff from the Bahamas back to Florida."

So she gets this evil pull always in a stew going she dips the apple in.Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, she somehow can't lace it with arsenic or something simple. So she comes up with a really elaborate potion. And the potion is like it'll give whoever bites it everlasting slumber instead of killing them outright. Which seems ridiculous, really.Snow White will sleep forever and she can only be awakened by love, true love's first kiss.And the witch is like, true love bad. I'll never have him. So she disguises herself as like, an old gypsy and she wanders off into the woods towards the dwarves house. And so so the morning it's whatever morning it is the dwarves head off to work at the mines. She's by herself baking pies and stuff.And so the witch comes up dressed as a gypsy, disguised. And it's like, do you want some of these apples? And Snow White's like, okay, for my pies, be nice to have some apples.Which is like, here's an apple, try a bite. Try this one. And it's the poisoned apple. And so all of the birds and the animals figure out what she's up to and try to stop her but they're not successful. And so Snow White takes a bite and then faints and falls into deep sleep.So all the birds and the animals rush off to the mines to tell the doors what's going on. They don't get it at first and they're really annoyed by the animals. But eventually they figure it out. They rush back, they fend off the evil witch and she kind of runs off. And then I think she's on like a cliff, like a bluff or something.Lightning strikes. She falls down into a river or something like that. She falls into like yeah, like she falls down to a river so you don't see her for the rest of the movie. She's basically defeated. But then Snow White's still in the coma.Oh, also at the beginning of the story I forgot to say that Snow White was really into true love and waiting for prince and stuff.And so she's like, one day, my prince will so at the end of the movie I mean, the story the prince is like I've heard about this sleeping Beauty. Oh, wait, that's another story. This sleeping beautiful woman who the true love's first kiss will awaken her."

And I remember having IV that had way I can't remember what it was exactly, because I never knew, but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it. And they said, you can push this button whenever you have a lot of pain. You can't push it any less than six minutes apart.If you try, it won't do anything. So you're all right, don't worry about it. So whenever I have felt that I couldn't stand it, I would push that button. Then I remember seeing my daughter's face. I remember seeing her and her husband.And I don't remember ever communicating with them. I remember bits and pieces of nurses coming and catheters being inserted, but again, they're just bits and pieces. I never saw the whole thing happening, just bits of it. I remember getting out of bed the first day and being led around a little bit. And I remember the second day walking with the walker around the core of the and the third day, I remember I was climbing the stairs and coming down.And each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time, not communicating with him, anything. And when I left, my daughter asked me several questions being a nurse. And I said, you know, I remember one day you came twice. She said, we came twice every day, so that shows how much I was out. I remember another thing sitting sitting up straight in the hospital, watching in my bed, watching a new patient come in to replace the one next to me and went out just like that.And the nurse came in later and I could hear her talking. That's it. She was saying, Boy, she fell asleep sitting up. And I thought, I'm not asleep, I'm just gaga.And that's pretty much it. And I remember the therapy afterwards and pain and medication of the Vicodin. And I remember saying things that didn't make sense and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to deliver the new cabinets that my son in law was putting in my kitchen. And I remember asking him, I had just taken vitamin. And I remember asking him, now, who are you?And I knew very well who he was. And he would answer very slowly. And I thought, oh, he's trying to humor me. And I'd say, I ask you these stupid questions. And I was praying, and I said, now, let me I could hear myself say, now let me write this down.And so in in due course, about 3 hours later, these men showed up and I was back, sort of, and I said, they come in.

And it was like a week long, and it would always be one would be in the United States, and the second one of the year would be outside the United States. And this year it was going to be in San Francisco, and it'll be 20 years ago next month. And my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening, and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a lot of the background work and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week.And so Don stayed here and my sister from Dallas flew in, and that was the week that they had the San Francisco earthquake. And so we were at Fisherman's Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free, and we were waiting to go on the trolley car back to St. Francis, the western St. Francis. And as we're waiting in line, the earthquake hit.And it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that. And so my sister, just being the big sister, she always tried to calm me down, and she said that was probably a two or three. And how she came up with that, I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake, so we didn't know. But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off, so nothing worked.And so we walked 18 blocks back to our hotel, and in San Francisco, you know, it's pretty mean. It was quite a jump back there, and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel. So we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was we were concerned about Mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there, and we wanted to also call our two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called Mother, who never watches news.She doesn't like to hear the bad news, and there's hardly any good news that's told. So we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know, but my sister said, Mother, what are you doing? And she said, Well, I'm watching the news because so and so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco. So it was a lot of fear at the beginning.We were on the 19th floor, so we had to walk up to the 19th floor and then walk down with our luggage. So it was just the fear of the unknown."

I wasn't nervous to have a baby, except that she came so fast and when she came on her due date, which is precisely who she is, and I got to the hospital and was already at like eight or something, so there were very few options for me except to just have the baby. And I did. And I just remember her coming out and looking like this little Manchichi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And she was so brown, her hair was so brown and she had this brown hair all over, and I have light hair and her dad has light hair, so it was just pretty incredible to see this little baby with all this brown hair.Anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just don't it doesn't go away. I remember what I was wearing when I got there. I remember where I was sitting in the car. I remember the stoplights we went through. I remember the path to the hospital.I remember everything about it. And then bringing her home. Nothing was the same ever again. So it's like I remember every detail. And then my whole world just she was always there then, and then it was like she was never not there.And then her brother I was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have Grace because she, like I said, came so fast. And when I got to the hospital, there was nothing to do except have this baby. And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember my gynecologist know you had a very quick first born. This is going to happen again. And I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks.And all I could think was, when is this going to happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain going to come back? And that's not how it worked at all. Actually. He was also born on his due date, so now we've determined it's me who has to have things in the right place.But we rode to the hospital. I checked myself in. It was so calm. It was the exact opposite. And he came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face.And I just remember thinking, there are so many times when people say no two kids are alike, or boy, girl, two boys, two girls, doesn't matter. They were completely different. They are still completely different, but they are the best things I have. I look at my life and that's it. It's them.So that's, I guess, my most important story in two parts. I'm going to show you these pictures. Take a little time to look through these pictures. They do tell a story.

Well, one day she was looking out at the hill, and she saw the beautiful castle up on the hill, and she dreamed about what it would be like to live in a castle someday. But she had to go back to all her work. More cooking, more cleaning. But she was such a nice and gentle person that all the animals loved her and flocked to her.All the mice and the horses and the dogs and the cats. Everyone loved her so much. Well, up at the castle, there was a prince. And the king, who was the prince's father, decided it was time for the prince to get married. So he and his advisors decided to have a ball for the prince to meet all the eligible women in the kingdom so he could pick his bride.So they sent out invitations to the whole country for everyone with eligible brides or girls to come to the ball. Cinderella's house got an invitation, too. And everybody was so excited. Both stepsisters thought it would just for sure be her that the prince would choose. So they used Cinderella to help them get ready, get their dresses, get everything ready.And Cinderella wanted to go, too, but she didn't have time to get herself ready. So the animals got ready for her. They made her a dress and did her hair and got her all ready to go. And she ran downstairs to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go. She said that only girls, only the stepsisters could go.And she ripped Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was so upset, she went back to her room and she cried and she cried, and lo and behold, what appeared. But her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother said, cinderella, you can go to the ball. And she used magic to make her a new dress and to turn the mice into footman and to turn the pumpkin into a carriage. And off she went to the ball in the brand new dress that the fairy godmother had made by magic.For her, especially important was she was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet. So she went to the ball, and the minute she entered the ball, the prince had eyes for no one but Cinderella. And they danced, and they danced, and they danced, and they had a wonderful time. But then the clock struck midnight, and the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight. So the clock started striking midnight, and Cinderella had to run before the prince saw that she wasn't really a princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella.She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away. But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home and the Prince was sad, but he knew he had her glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside for whose ever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fit it would become his bride. And they went around and no one's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to Cinderella's house.Both stepsisters tried, but their feet wouldn't fit. Finally, they tried it on Cinderella and her foot fit perfectly. And she and the Prince got married and lived happily ever after. The end. And I keep talking.Can you tell me how you'd make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Well, being the methodical OCD person that I am, first I get everything out on my counter. I get out the bread, I get out the peanut butter, I get out the jelly. Or in my case, I used grape jelly.And I get out a knife. Two knives at a plate."

He's vomiting mostly in the morning. In fall of 2010, he went on antibiotics, got a little bit better, so we thought everything was okay. After a week or so, it started to go badly again. We took him back to the pediatrician, who ordered a CT scan of his sinuses, but also just, he said, kind of as a throwaway, like defensive medicine, almost always get a CT of his whole head.So I took him to Bloomington Hospital for the CT.On the way, we were listening to Judas Priest and he asked me if that was Iron Maiden, which seems silly, but it was the first time he recognized the style of music, which was the new wave of Bread of Sheavy metal and the operatic vocals that are consistent between the two of them. So that was awesome. We get into the CT scan. He does it. The phone rings out in the waiting room, and it's the radiologist.And first he says, who is this? And I tell him, I didn't mean to talk to you. He was trying to call the pediatrician and inadvertently actually got me. It was clear that he didn't want to break in retrospect, it was clear that he didn't want to break the news. Pediatrician called back and then said that they'd found a three and a half centimeter tumor in the back of his head and that he should go to Riley the next day.And about, I don't know, less than 30 minutes later, he called back and said, I spoke to the surgeon at Riley. He wants to see him now. So we just had to pack up stuff, take him to Riley. He underwent brain surgery. The next were prior to brain surgery for cancer.They took us out for the consent, and the residents telling me about this potential complication called posterior fossil mutism, which is a rare complication based on the location of the tumor, and that in rare cases, it meant that he wouldn't be able to speak for a little while afterward, which is funny. Not funny. I mean, he has to get consent, but what choice do you have? Well, I don't want him to not have to speak for a little while, so I'm just going to let him have cancer in his brain. It'll be fine.What could go wrong? So he does it. What I learned was that posterior Faustum mutism is just kind of an old, archaic, almost way of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior fossil mutism, posterior fossil syndrome, which is more the mutism."

And then he himself died, leaving her in the care of this woman, who treated her as the family and made her clean the fireplaces, hence the name Cinderella. And do other menial work? At some point the prince of the whatever principality it was, was in need of a wife, said his father and the, I don't know, minister of whatever marriages. So they cooked up a scheme to have a ball and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality.Cinderella got one, but she, of course, did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation. But then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach, with white horses and a footman and so forth. So she was able to go to the ball, but the provision was that she must, must leave at midnight. She went to the ball and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated. And the Prince danced with her and basically fell in love.Midnight came and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she had to be out of there. So she hurried away and in her hurrying she lost one slipper, which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her. She was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth. But she managed to get home anyway. And later the Prince was very depressed.He had fallen in love with this woman and she had disappeared. All he had left was a glass slipper and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else. So his father, who I guess was the king and the Minister of Marriages, went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on. And of course, it would not fit anyone at all, including the two unpleasant stepsisters, even though I believe in one story, one of them cut off a toe in order to fit, try to fit in, but it still didn't work and it got blood all over the place. But finally, the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper with Cinderella.And of course she was just a slady, but he insisted that she try it on."

Speech is one of the big ones. I have 22 kids and probably 16 of them have speech delays of some kind. The majority of them are language delays and we work with them a lot.So I work for these kids every day. We have a licensed speech therapist that comes in once a week and teaches a lesson and then we follow up on whatever she wants us to do the rest of the week. So our language kids, we really work hard with them on questions, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, on, off, under, over. And that's a lot of just talking to them and using the correct language and getting them to mimic what we want them to say so it just becomes natural and wrote with them. We have our severe kids with speech delays, which are their phonetics.Their sounds wouldn't call them severe. They're in the middle. So we work a lot with stopping them every time they're saying something incorrectly and prompting them to do either modeling or prompting them to say the correct thing, the right sound, and doing a lot of the tongue up, mouth open, back in your throat sound. And then our severe cases are we have two children with autism and one child that was born addicted to crack and the boy that was born addicted to one of the autistic kids aren't typical autistic kids. They're very low verbal kids.So we're just working with them on environmental sounds and becoming aware that I'm in their space and part of their world and to associate sounds and communication as a way to get me to do something for them. We're working a lot on recognizing that a sound means me and a sound means them.Our crack baby, that's not a good way, but that's what I'll call him because I'm not going to use his name. But he has physical issues too. He's a drooler, so we work with him a lot on physically reminding him shut his mouth and focus. And there's a lot of rote work with him also, but there's a lot of trying to get him to mentally focus on it's. A lot of just rote training and repetition and over and over and over.And sometimes we see results and sometimes it takes forever and we don't see anything. But that's how it is. Can you tell me okay, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid, or more recently, the same story or the different story from what you told last week? Just make sure if it's the same story, you tell it as if I've never heard, I'm going to tell you a different story.Okay. About 1999, I took my kids sledding up in Troy, Ohio, which is just north of here. My son was five and my daughter was three, so my husband went two and we were sledding and we were having a good time on the levee, which is a small hill, but just about right for a five year old."

Fox, she kind of has like the bobbing of the head and whatnot and very emotional, which she never was before. So it's kind of like you never know if you say, I think it's going to rain today, if that will make her cry or not. So what I have found with her, whereas she doesn't live in my same town, so we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything.And without physically seeing her face, I have to start the conversation slow and see where she's at in her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues or if this conversation will just be about nothing. So I've had to do a lot more listening to her and listening to the cues versus normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, oh my gosh, this happened today and you just start rambling. But I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her now, so she takes it all to heart. So for me, I've really had to kind of let go of part of our relationship because I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's going to upset her or not. And it's sad.So getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody because she doesn't do FaceTime or anything, which to me that would be a clear indication I can read her face a lot better. So asking the right questions and just listening a lot more. I'd like you to think about something important that happened in your life and I would like you to tell me a story about this event. It can be happy or sad from childhood up to now, anything that stands out in your mind that you would like to tell a story about.Okay, I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy. So I really don't go to the doctors, I don't like to go to doctors. And that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I didn't read a lot about it.I just went through it because I was fine the whole way. And then when we got to the hospital, I had to be induced. I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know what I was signing up for. But when we walked into that hospital, I got panicked because I didn't know anything.And my mom was there. She came up and she saw my doctor. And I remember the first thing she said. She goes, Your doctor is as old as you are. And she was she was only like a couple of years older than me.But I really didn't think anything about it. And then I started getting nervous. I thought, well, I wonder how many babies she still."

        "transcript": "She doesn't know what to do with her arms. Anyway, so Snow White is working as a servant. And the Evil Queen goes up to the mirror and says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still snow white. That hasn't changed.And so the Evil Queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger for productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do because that seems like a very narrow minded and not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror. Anyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point the queen says to herself, well, I guess I can't do anything.Gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so dang lonely. And she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life, she's wishing for the one she loves, even though I'm not sure she has a true grasp of what that would actually entail. But basically one day she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet. She's kind of creepy.He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself, I'm wishing, I'm wishing for the one I love today. And then creepy prince comes in and goes today out of nowhere. And it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet.But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life and she's terrified, rightly? And so the prince goes away and she goes back to her lonely life. And this is the point at which the queen is like, well, clearly I need to kill her. This is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this huntsman and says, huntsman, you're going to kill Snow White.You're going to bring me her heart as proof. I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like Snow White. It's not like Snow White has a sewn on label that says Property of Snow White on her heart. But that's not the point. The queen is clearly a little bit few fries short of a Happy Meal.So the huntsman goes out and he chases Snow White a little bit through the woods. And then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure, he could never kill her. And so he falls to his knees in supplication and he says, I'm so sorry. And he drops the knife and Snow White's like and then he says, run away and I will cover for you, but you better run away and never come back because the queen is going to kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest.And he brings the heart of a wild boar to the queen and says, Look, Queen, this is Snow White's heart. Heart of a wild boar. Doesn't look like a human heart. The Queen is stupid, basically. And the Queen says, Ah, yes, cook that into a meal for me.And then she proceeds to eat this boreheart, thinking that it's Snow White's, which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids. I don't know about you. So Snow White has fled into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her, and she's making weird faces again.And eventually she makes it to this cottage where she breaks in. Breaking in ring also a common theme in these stories. She breaks in and she sees it's kind of dusty and kind of rows, but she sees all in a little row, a bunch of little beds, like for people who are maybe 3ft tall, if that. And she says, Well, I'm going to crash on one of those beds later. I guarantee it."

        "transcript": "Okay, so a boy was playing outside, and when he kicked his soccer ball, it went through someone's living room window and crashed into a man who was relaxing on his chair. And the man got up, looked out the window and thinking about what to do next. Okay, next we have this one again. Look at the pictures. They tell a story.Take a look at all of them and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Um, mother was trying to get her child to take an umbrella because she knew it was going to rain. Today. However, the little kid decided not to go to school with an umbrella because he didn't think he would need it. But then it started raining and the poor little boy ran home to mom all wet and sadly asked for an umbrella when she was upset at him for not taking it. To beginning in the begin with and then he walked to school with umbrella.Okay.Now, take a look at this picture. Take a look at everything that's going on. And again. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All Right.So a little girl riding a tricycle had a little kitty cat and came upon a tree. The cat wanted to climb up the tree. So it got stuck and she yelled for it, but it would not come down. So she got her dad to try to get the cat from the tree. And while doing so, his ladder fell down and their neighbor's dog came and started barking at the tree.So the father was not able to get down. The fire station was called, and they're bringing a letter to retrieve him and the cat. Okay, Good.So now I'm going to ask you to tell a story. Have you heard of the story of Cinderella? I have. Okay, Cool. Do you remember much about it?Yeah. So these pictures might remind you of how it goes. You can take a look at the pictures in the book. And then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. So take a little time and look at it then.Whenever you're ready.So there was a girl and a father. The father met another woman that he wanted to marry who happened to have two daughters. The stepsisters were snobs and then the father died. Cinderella was left without anyone to protect her. So the evil stepmother made her clean the cinders from the fireplace.Hence her name. Cinderella."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a little girl named Cinderella. And she was brought to the home of a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her. And she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters. But as it turned out, the sisters were not very nice, and neither was the the mom, her stepmom, and they actually put her to work, and she had to do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose. But Cinderella was happy nonetheless, and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the birds and such.And she was a very kindred spirit, that's Cinderella. And she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride, and they invited all the eligible women from the kingdom. And in her heart, she thought, I would just love to go to that ball. And she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of course, she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella, but the stepsisters were going to go, and she had to help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball. And Cinderella was sad.She went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends, who were very encouraging and said, we'll help you, Cinderella. And they brought out some ribbon and some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her. And she had the dress, but she had no way of getting to the ball. And she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared, and it was her fairy godmother and her fair. My fairy godmother said, don't cry, my child.I know you want to go to the ball, and I can help you. Just fetch me a pumpkin, and I'll turn it into a coach, and your mice friends will be the coachman. And so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the coachman, and off she went to the ball, feeling like the luckiest girl in the world. And when she got there, she approached the ball and looked down the stairs, and there everyone was dancing. And they saw her come in, and they turned and looked at her, and the prince looked, and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman that he had ever seen.He invited her to dance, and they just had a nice connection, and she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing. And suddenly the time had gone by, and it was midnight, and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight. So quick, she ran from the castle. And in doing so, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper, and she found her way home. And the Prince retrieved the slipper and was determined to find the fair maiden who left it there.So he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them. And everyone tried on the slipper. And when he came to the house of where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived, the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper. And it didn't quite work. But Cinderella apparently was locked up in a room upstairs.And the mice gave her the key, and she got out and she came down and she said she'd like to try on the slipper. And with that, she tried on the slipper. And her wicked stepmother and her sisters were amazed that she could have been that beautiful person that night. But as it was, she tried on the slipper. He knew she was the princess that he wanted.And they got married and they lived happily ever after. I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness."

        "transcript": "Okay, well, just to not be redundant, I'll talk about something else. I did think of another surgery that I had when I was younger, was when I was a teenager, getting my wisdom teeth taken out. And I think a lot of people probably have had that done as a I'm telling you, my dog does this every time. I know that messes up the transcriptions. Don't worry.Sorry. But anyway, so when I was 16, I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again, I'd never really had to have any anesthesia or anything like that, so it was kind of a new experience. Of course, it was an outpatient situation, but since a lot of my friends had had it done before, I kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then because I know now people videotape people coming out of the anesthesia.But I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I'd never had anesthesia before. So it was kind of interesting. And I just remember being having the cotton all in my mouth when I was trying to talk, and it was rather painful. I remember that, too. And then it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly.So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had. I know from last week that you do in fact, have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. So again, just share what problems that you've experienced with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help. Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research, it's been really interesting to me having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has aphasia.I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this. But I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate. Make sure that I ask questions. Ask yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman who is actually in Mexico.They went on a trip to Mexico before the quarantine, and they actually kind of got stuck down there because they don't want to put her on a so anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit. And we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So it was a challenge to help because she did have some probably moderate aphasia. And her son was on the phone, too, so I was on the speaker phone.So just that whole thing of really slowing everything down, asking her questions several times and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that definitely makes you think about all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have Aphasia. And I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one on one communication with folks. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from when you were a child or more recently, again, you can tell the same story as last week, or you can choose a different story.I'll tell a different story. I have lots of stories. I think all speech pathologists have lots of stories, right?"

        "transcript": "He is very surprised to see a soccer ball come whopping through his window. Probably it does break the glass, which lands on the floor, and it's unclear if it's his house we'll say it is. And he gets up, and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out through the hole of the broken window, and he sees the boy. And we don't have any more pictures here, but I think the little boy says, oh, I am so sorry.I'm so sorry. And we'll assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry, sir, that I broke your window, but I will work for you to try to replace it. And so that's what he did. So again, these panels of pictures tell a story.Take a second to look them over. They go left to right and then bottom and then left to right again. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see with a beginning, a middle and an end. The little boy has his backpack on, and he's getting ready to go to school. And his mom says, it's raining outside or it's going to rain and you better take an umbrella.And he says, no, look, the sky is completely clear. I don't want to take an umbrella, but I think you better. The weather report says it's going to rain, but he won't do it. And so she said, all right, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school.And sure enough, pretty soon it starts raining. Drip, drip, drip. And as then, he starts to continue. But then he turns around and it's raining even harder now, and he's really upset. And he runs back home, drip, drip, drip on the kitchen floor.And his mother says, I told you. And he said, well, you are right. I do need an umbrella. So this time he was willing to take the umbrella. He put it up, and off he went in the rain on his way to school.All right. So this first picture tells a story. Take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story you see with a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat.And one day, a dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree. And there the cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see from the picture, the dog is still barking. So of course, the cat isn't going to come down. And she probably cried and cried.And finally her father came out and what's the matter? Kitty cat is up in the tree, and the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat. And so he did. But the dog is still barking.It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage, but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get but he can't get as far out as the cat is. If he did, he would surely break the limb and he would fall. So as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody, maybe the mother in the house, saw what was happening and she called the fire department.And so here comes the fire department. They are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree, but the dog is no longer barking. So the cat jumps down the end."

The people who took care of me were outstanding, and they couldn't understand why I wasn't asking for pain pills all the time.The only thing that was unsatisfactory was the wound, and it could have used an awful lot of help.Never saw the doctor the whole time I was there, and I think I was there pretty close to ten days when you count it's not called extended care. Three halves what it is. And they finally let us have a bath. Prior to that, we couldn't get the incision wet, so it was a little frustrating. And it was fairly structured because 09:00 sake, they came and brought a handful of pills, and then at 10:00 they came and brought a pill.Then they changed the shift, and the next person came in and asked, how are you? How are you feeling? Can you move your leg? Can you do this, that or the other thing? And their attitude was very nice.They made you feel like you were an intelligent adult, and you can't say that every place you go.However, finally got to take a bath, and oh, it felt so nice.And my disposition got better that day too.They had an exercise person who came and had us wiggle our toes. Stand on your toes and raise up your heel. And then they had you lean to one side and then the other, and you could see that what the point of these various directions were, because they wanted to get limberness in your joint. However, I evidently haven't done the right things because I haven't got the right kinds of movement in my knee yet. And I saw the doctor last week, and when he poked my knee, I said Ouch, and he poked some more, and I said ouch again.So then he was able to bring a needle and take some shinobi.

Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating if which I know is with someone who cannot communicate very well, please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it. Okay. My husband fell off a ladder or he might have fallen out of the attic, we don't know for sure.He sustained a severe, horrible head injury, called the ambulance, we got him to Methodist Hospital where in the middle of the night he had 3 hours of skull surgery and the surgeon told us afterwards, well, I fixed his skull, but I cannot fix his brain. So after that he was one month in Methodist Hospital in the traumatic brain injury area and then he was discharged and he went to Community Rehabilitation Hospital for another month for both speech and physical and occupational therapy. After that he was sent to a subacute rehab place called Hamilton Trace where he spent the next three months. Then he came home to our house and we set up a hospital bed for him here in our living room. And then he had speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy and a nurse who came to see us in our home.And that occupied just about every morning of the week and that went on during the summer. And then they decided they'd done what they could for him. And then we signed him up for rehabilitation services at community outpatient places, one place. And he went there it was three times a week for two to 3 hours at a time. And that lasted until pretty much the end of the year when they gently said we think it would be good if you would take a little vacation from us now.And what they really meant was we've done all we can for you, goodbye. But we also got Ted signed up with a place called Neurohope. Neurohope offered physical therapy, but not the other two modalities. And so he has been a patient at Neurohope ever since. And I cannot say that he has made much, if any, progress in any of those areas.His speech is still limited to yeah, no. And once in a while I don't know, but I have learned pretty much to tell what he wants, even without language. We have tried Scrabble tiles and yesterday, for example, I asked him what kind of sandwich do you want? And he wrote out bacon, although he had one letter misspelled, but it was close enough that I knew what he wanted.Ah, I wish that we had some way of improving communication with him, but we don't. So we make do with the best we."

But it was amazing because we literally did this every Sunday, or like I said, almost every Sunday. And every time it was as magical as it was the time before, even though it was the same thing, the same PD, the same beautifully spread dinner, the same enchanted walk to the forest, the same horses. So I would say that is definitely one of the most important memories days events for me.Here's another picture telling a different story. And again, please tell us a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Just one moment. Okay, and you may begin. So there was a super cool kid who was really good at soccer, and he was so good on his team and good at his school.And he knew he was so good that he could just kick the ball anywhere that he wanted to, anytime. And that's what he was doing until he accidentally kicked the ball into his neighbor's house and broke the window. And the neighbor was startled and upset and knocked down his lamp and disrupted his television watching for the afternoon. And then he looked out the window to see where the ball came and the boy was gone. Okay, so here are some more pictures that tell a story.Go ahead and take a look at all of them first, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And one moment. Let me mute myself.Really does it hasn't been recognizing my mute button. Come here. There we go. All right, you may begin.Okay, so, boy, it was the end of the school day, and his teacher was suggesting that because he's a walker, she said, you really need to take my umbrella because it's going to start raining, and I don't want you to get wet on your walk home. And the little boy said, no, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm going to be fine. You keep your umbrella because I don't want you to get wet when you walk out to your car. And so she kept her umbrella.And then the little boy started walking, and the rain started coming down harder and harder, and he thought, oh, no, my tablet is in my backpack, so I need to go back to school, and I'm going to have to let my teacher know that she was right. I need that umbrella so that I don't ruin the school's tablet. So he went back, and that's what he did. He told her that he was wrong long, and that she should let him hopefully take the umbrella and use it to walk home. And she did.So he walked home happily with his umbrella protecting his tablet from the rain."

And the dad gets up with the ball, looks out the window and is about to say something to the boy. The end.Cinderella is about a king and his daughter. And the king has to leave the daughter with some relative of his who have two other daughters. So when the young lady Narella gets there, they treat her really bad, they treat her really mean. They make her do all sorts of cleaning outside with the animals and taking care of the house and cooking and sewing and stuff like that. And she has to live in this room that's really the whole house is beautiful except her room, where it's up like in a dungeon.And one day they get an invitation. The family, oh, it's the stepmother. The stepmother. So the living with the dad and the stepmother, they get the invitation to the okay, get the invitation to go to the ball. And the two stepsisters are really, really happy about attending the ball.And Cinderella really, really wants to go. And she knows she can't go. But then there comes a very godmother who grants her some wishes and she's able to go. She's able to go, but she doesn't have anything to wear. So the fairy godmother gives her the three wishes and one of them is a dress, one of them is a chariot to go.I can't remember what the other wishes. And then the stepsisters find out that she's able to go. And somehow or another, either they rip her dress or something like that, or they well, anyway, the stepsisters get to go and the mother of the house is still really mean to Cinderella. And the night of the ball, Cinderella goes in a big beautiful white gown and a chariot with a horse. The wish.The fairy godmother makes the chariot out of a pumpkin, I think, and the mouse and then he gets to the ball and she gets there a little late, but when she walks in there, she makes an impression. And the king's son wants to dance with her. So they dance, but she has to know that she has to be out of there by midnight because she's going to turn back into the rags clothes that she had. So as soon as the clock makes that noise that it's going to be twelve, she runs off. But then she trips and she loses her shoe and she gets back home.And the prince never finds out where she lives, where she's from. So he goes around the whole area and looks to see if anybody's foot fits into the shoe. And then finally, somehow or another, he gets to that house and doesn't see her. But then he gets later on he gets to see her. And her foot fits the shoe and we live happily ever after."

And she could speak, but it was difficult to understand her. But by watching her expressions on her face and her lips, I was actually able to understand what she said. And I made sure that I looked at her when I was answering her questions back so she could read my lips.And we didn't have to have anybody interpret or write down anything. So it was good.Tell me what happened. Years ago when my daughter was in college and we lived in Texas, I lived in the Dallas area and she was going to school at Texas A M. And unbeknownst to me, she decided to fly to Alabama for the weekend to see an old boyfriend but told everyone that she was driving to Dallas to see me. So when I tried to get a hold of her, she wasn't at work. I could not find her.And that was before cell phones were used. And worst fear was thinking she'd been in a car accident on the way to Dallas. And so I had to start I got down a sheet because I used to work for an attorney. So I got down a piece of paper and started writing down things I needed to do. First I called the highway patrol, no reports of accidents.And then I started calling hospitals and nobody there. And then I started remembering friends names, getting numbers, and they were lying for her. And I finally got one to admit where she had.In the meantime, I had called my friend who was my attorney and he came over and we actually tracked her down in a nightclub in Alabama with the ex boyfriend and of course was very relieved that she was okay. But after the attorney got through talking to her saying that she need to apologize and that this would never happen again and it never did. Go ahead. This young lady was actually out on a third date with her boyfriend in the high country and they went across a slow moving creek and didn't have any problems. And they decided to come back across it like several hours later.And of course the water was much more swift. It swept them down. They actually got swept out of their vehicle and she clung to a tree for 3 hours as the cold water raced by her and they called for help. And finally rescue people actually were able to take a raft and get close enough so that one of the rescue gentlemen could get a hold of her and bring her back to shore. A young fellow was playing soccer and apparently his yard or possibly his neighbor's yard and he has such good kicking ability, his soccer ball went through the window, breaking the window, landing inside the living room, knocking over a lamp, surprising the gentleman that was sitting in the chair there.The gentleman gets up, holding the sarcobal and looks out the window, wondering what had just happened."

She was sitting there crying.And then along comes the fairy godmother to save the day. And she touches Cinderella with her wand and she's in a beautiful gown. And then she touches the pumpkin and it turns into a beautiful chariot with horses. And off Cinderella goes to the ball, unbeknownst to her stepmother and sisters. Cinderella's at the ball, dancing and having a ball, having fun and dancing with the prince.And then she turns around and the clock strikes twelve or one, I can't remember. And she says, oh my gosh, I have to go, otherwise I'm going to turn back into my house clothes and my cleaning clothes. So she runs out the door and she loses a slipper, but she still has one on. So she gets home and she's thinking about how wonderful the ball was. And then a knock comes at the door and they say, we have a slipper here and we don't know who it belongs to.So we're going around town letting all the ladies try them on to see who it belongs to, because that will be who the prince marries. And so Cinderella's listening and she's hoping that she gets to try the shoe on. And her stepmom is like, you don't need to try it on her, she wasn't there. And so they tried on her and sure enough, the shoe fits and her and the prince live happily ever after."

        "transcript": "Okay. The new stepmother arrives with her two daughters and the father is introducing the girls to his daughter Cinderella. They immediately show expressions of whatever they put her down their expression. They are then shown in the book. It's growing up.Cinderella is taking the role of the servant and there's a scene in which the king tells probably the prime minister something that they need to do something about getting the prince married. So they announce a ball, send out invitations to all the young women in the kingdom and family's very excited about this and girls are all planning to go to the ball.Cinderella in this book evidently opens up a chest and finds a ball gown and maybe a diary or something of her mother. So I don't remember that as being part of the story as I'm going to call it. But that's what seems to be in the book. And puts out the ball gown to plan to go. But when she gets dressed, everybody rejects the idea that she could go and she stays home.The her godmother arrives and arranges for her to go and gets an even more beautiful dress for her to wear. Stories I remember it always had the carriage that was generated from a pumpkin that she goes in. I don't even remember seeing that in a book. She goes to the ball, she makes a hit with a prince but she has to leave at midnight. She's got the instructions leave at midnight, otherwise she will return to the clothes she was wearing before she got the ball dress and the carriage will turn into a pumpkin and she races out of the ball before trying to get home before midnight and loses a shoe.And in the last slipper in the course of the process, the prince is left having no idea where to find this young woman that he's become entranced with. And he has only the shoe. And they put out a proclamation that the shoe should be taken throughout the kingdom until they find who it fits. And when they get to the home of Cinderella, everyone tries it on but it fits Cinderella to the art of the stepdaughters. And Cinderella Mary is the prince."

And she says that she should go and have a wonderful time but to remember to come home by the stroke of twelve because that says how long the spell will last and it'll all go back to the way it was. So Cinderella hears her and waves goodbye, and then she travels to the ball where she meets the Prince and dances with him. They sort of have the love at first sight kind of thing going on. They dance, and even her stepmother and stepsisters see her but don't recognize her.They dance. And then time goes by because they're so happy. Time goes by that they don't realize that the time has gone by. They're so happy, they don't realize the time has gone by. And the clock is striking twelve and Cinderella is reminded that the spell will be over.And so she rushes away. But in her haste to run away before the spell elapses, she loses a glass slipper. And the Prince picks it up and he says something like, what's your name? Where will you go? How will I find you?And she runs away. And so she had a wonderful time at the know. Cinderella actually is ready to live pretty content on the fact that she had a really nice night and life sort of goes back to the way it was, except for the Prince is looking for her because he loves her. And so he starts visiting all the maidens in the kingdom and asking them to try on this glass slipper. And by the time the messenger arrives at their home, the stepsisters and Lady Tremaine have actually realized that the King is seeking out this mysterious girl that he met at the ball.And Lady Tremaine actually puts together that Cinderella was at the ball because Cinderella is singing a song and dancing and is happy. And so she sort of puts together that she's the mysterious girl that the Prince is looking for and she locks Cinderella in her room and puts the key in her pocket.

And the glass slipper doesn't fit Anastasia and Tresella's foot, although they try to deceive them into thinking that it does. But really their feet are too much, too big.And the animals, meanwhile, steal the key from Lady Tremaine's pocket, take it all the way up the stairs and unlock the door. So Cinderella comes out just in the nick of time and the messenger is happy to see her. And Cinderella's like, I'll try on the glass slipper and Lady Tremaine trips him and the glass slipper breaks and the advisor is really upset because he thinks the King's going to be mad. But then Cinderella produces is the other glass slipper, and it fits. And then she gets to be the princess.She gets to marry the prince and be the princess, and they live happily ever after. Except for her ballroom gown was way better than her weding gown."

Tell them to come over here. And the dog seems to like you too.So fairy godmother waved her magic wand, and the pumpkin turned into a carriage, and the mice turned into horses, and the dog turned into chauffeur.Cinderella now was able to go to the ball. She got into the carriage and off to the ball they went. When Cinderella arrived, everybody was stunned at her beauty. They couldn't believe how incredible she looked.But she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having. She tried to remember one thing that their fairy godmother had told her. She said she needed to be back by midnight. She said if she wasn't back by midnight, the pumpkin was going to turn back or the carriage was going to turn back into a pumpkin, and that the horses were going to turn back into mice and that the chauffeur was going to turn back into the dog. So Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then.She was having so much fun, she lost track of time. When she looked up at the clock, she noticed that it was almost 12:00. And while she was dancing with the prince, she quickly broke away from him, says, I got to go, I got to go. And the prince says, no, you can't go. I think I found my true love.Cinderella continued to run. I got to go. I must go. And as Cinderella was running out, she left a shoe behind. She hesitated for a second to get it, but realized she didn't have enough time.So she quickly hopped into the carriage. The carriage drove off and got her home just in time. Clothes turned to rags. The carriage turned into a pumpkin. The horse turned into mice, and the chauffeur turned into the dog.Back at the palace, the prince, while he was chasing Cinderella Notices, there was a glass slipper that was still there. So he picked up the glass lipper and said, I must find this woman whose ever woman's foot can fit into this shoe. That's the person that I'm going to marry.The prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe, one house after another. None of the females foot would fit into the glass slipper. And so finally, he came to Cinderella's house. As the prince arrived, the mother and the evil stepsisters, they locked Cinderella into the closet where she couldn't get out. And so the prince came in, and the two daughters tried on the shoes with all of their shoes with all their might, and they could not put their feet into it.However, her friends, the little mice, noticed that the prince was there, and so they found a key to the room, and they gave it to Cinderella. So that she could open the door, and the prince could see that there was another woman in the house. So the prince asked her to try on the shoe, and she did. And magically, she transformed back into the lady that he saw that night. And the prince realized the prince realized that he had found the love of his life.So they got together, they drove back to the palace, got married, and lived happily ever after."

Turns out the stepsister and the stepmother are mean girls and they put Cinderella to work and she's befriended in the Disney version, she befriends or is befriended by little mice. So anyway, Cinderella is a scullery maid, essentially, to the family. Meanwhile, the king of the kingdom announces that his son, the prince, should marry.And they announce a ball to which Cinderella's family are invited. I think it's yes, they invite all the eligible women in the get and everybody's excited, including the stepsisters, who are not as pretty as Cinderella. But the mean girls kind of wreck Cinderella's dress. I'd forgotten that part until I saw the picture again this time. So she's left without a ball gown and they leave her behind and go off to the ball without her.But she is rescued by her fairy godmother, who creates a dress for her and changes a pumpkin into a carriage. I think the mice are the ones that become the footmen. And Austinderella goes to the ball with the admonition that she has to be done by midnight because all of the magic will end then. So she goes to the ball. Everybody is amazed at how beautiful she is, including prince.They dance. The clock starts to strike twelve and she runs out of the ball to get in her coach and leave. And she leaves behind a slipper, a glass slipper. It is in the Disney version. And she gets home and of course everything returns to the pumpkin.It was the next day, the prince, or sometime the prince is looking for the girl who dropped her slipper because she is the girl he loves. And they go about trying the shoe on, having every girl who was in the kingdom try the shoe on. It doesn't fit the stepsisters. And everyone is shocked in the household when it fits Cinderella. Anyway, she is the one and is revealed to be and so she and the prince marry and traditionally live happily ever after.Great. Thank you. Last brahmpt we have is just tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I just did that yesterday.I begin with two pieces of bread, wheat bread, and I spread jelly on one side. I always do the jelly first, as I said before, so that you don't contaminate the jelly with peanut butter. And then I spread the jelly on one piece of bread face up and peanut butter on the other side. And then I put them together and cut them in half."

She had a daughter the same age of mine and I came to know her because we each had a child in Brownies and we really liked each other from the get go. We just sort of hit it off. But what I came to find out about her was that she was Jewish. I am Christian.She was in a concentration camp in Germany and thank goodness she managed to make it through. And she was on one of the first boats out to this country because she had relatives who had come over generations earlier in Chicago and she ended up in Paducah, Kentucky. And we liked each other so very much that we became scout troop leaders together. And in the process of all this, of all the planning, we spent a lot of time together. And she told me much about her life in Germany and about the terrible, terrible times of the Holocaust.And one of the things that I remember vividly, the only reason that she really lasted her mother was Gentile. Her father was Jewish. And the line goes through the mothers. If you probably know this. The Jewish line goes through the mothers.And because of this, her uncle, this Ursula's uncle was her mother's brother and he was, of course, Gentile and he was the police officer in the town where she lived. So he was able to keep her off the list of the children who were going off to the concentration camps. But finally, at the end, he couldn't do it anymore. And she told me one time, which just broke my heart he sent her and her three siblings off to concentration camp but he would not look at them, at her mother. The mother and the father managed to stay in Dresden and they were both killed in the fire bombing in Dresden just before the war was over.But probably that was one of the most and it was secondhand to me. It was not something that happened to me but it was something that I became very much involved in because I listened to her stories and she didn't just tell me the story. It was things she just told me little by little. And finally, in the village where she grew up, they had asked her to come back. They wanted her to come back.They paid her would pay her, you know, to get her to come. They wanted they wanted some closure for them too because it was a terrible time and she wouldn't go. And she wouldn't go. And finally, I think about a year and she talked to me about it a lot. She finally decided she would go.She didn't think it was a very good idea, but she went. And when she came back, she said, I'm glad I went. I was able to forgive."

She had two daughters, and so his stepdaughters were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed. But things changed once they all arrived together, and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude. And the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way.She performed several tasks. At one point, an invitation comes to a ball and they're considering happily going. Cinderella's face is lighting up, but she doesn't realize what's going on. The ball is held because the king decided that his son it was time for the son to marry. And so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutants of the town.Well, Cinderella would love to go, and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going, because the mom and stepmother and the stepsisters had to focus only on themselves. So they prepared, had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy. But there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family. Well, there's a book in the picture book I don't remember at all. She discovers a book.I don't know if that's where she comes across an incantation, but a fairy godmother appears. And because in fairy tales, people do not have to go through things alone, the sweet little creatures, the mice and the little animals decide to help her. The fairy godmother helps her. And so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball, too. And as she arrives, she gets to be at the ball.I'm going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince and that as she runs back, tries to get back home, she leaves her slipper on the stair. I didn't see much in the book about the time frame, but that was a big thing in the movie that I remember. This clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight. But she had to get out of there by midnight, and she does. But then there is the return of the slipper, the finding of the slipper.So that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night.But as I said, the book seems a little bit different. There's a key. And I guess when she lets everyone in, finally, where is he? Why is the key there? I don't remember that part, but as I just remember, the story ends happily that he does find her and the slipper, and they're reunited.And so happily ever after."

Her name was Cinderella. This woman came with two daughters, but they were unpleasant and they were ugly. We have to be honest, they were very ugly. So there's a great deal of stress.Mr. Cinderella's father apparently died. She was just left with a stepmother and these two sisters. And they used to make her clean, and they used to make her cook. And they were very mean to her.And they made her live in the attic, and they made her wear old, ugly clothes. She was very, very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative. And she befriended all the animals in the house, the mice and the birds. And when she looked out the window every day, she used to see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father, the king and queen of Fantasia land. And she used to dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress, a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown.She never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear. And they always said to her, you'll never go to the you'll never go to the palace. So one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big, very big dance, because the king was sick and tired of his son not getting married. Seriously, all the pressure that goes on for women, just much for men. And it was time for the prince to get married, because one day he's going to be the king, and he needed to have children.He needed to have a wife. So they were going to have a big ball. So they were having a ball, and Cinderella's ugly, mean, stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go. And they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes, and Cinderella really, really wanted to go. She was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go.But the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds. And they knew how to sew, and they knew how to accessorize, and they knew how to design dresses, apparently. So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella. And she was so surprised and so excited.Then she went to the ball, and at the ball she met the prince. And it was just love at first sight, the way it should be. He loved her and she loved him, and they had a wonderful time dancing. And then her sisters saw her and were very, very upset that she was there. And they were pulling her dress and they were tearing her skirt and they chased her away and made her go home.But then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry. And so he sent out a message to all the houses in the land saying he wanted to come because he had found the magic slipper, the glass slipper that she had left and he was looking for because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry. But the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper. So the mice stole the key and stuck under the door and her out. And then the prince did find her and then they got married.And then the king was happy and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters. The end."

There were roadblocks up everywhere. But every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads. They don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water and that it's much deeper than they realized.One father had gone across or had attempted to cross the road. He thought because he had a pickup truck, he would be just fine. And as they entered the water, very quickly, the current pushed against the upstream side of the truck and pushed his truck right off the road.He and his daughter were the only ones in the truck. Daughter was in her seatbelt. He was able to get out of his seatbelt.Then he climbed to the top of the truck and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter.The water swept them off the top of the truck, and as they were swept downstream, they caught a tree. The girl hung onto the tree alone because her father had been swept further down, and he had to grab another tree down the way. Someone watching who had seen everything had called 911. The fire department got there, and they saw the little girl cling to the tree.One particularly strong, handsome young firefighter put on his life vest, jumped out into the water, grabbed the tree, put his arms around the little girl, and she clung to him, knowing that her life depended on it. He held her very tightly while he put another belt around her. There's a belt similar to the one he was wearing, and they tied themselves together with the belt and his friends back on shore. The other firefighters pulled him back to the shore with the girl when she was safe. A different firefighter went in after the father and got him safely out.And they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law. And he got a bill for $1,500 for the rescue of him and his daughter."

He runs all the way back home, and his mom is really angry. He's dripping water all over the floor. So he gets the umbrella and heads back on his way to school. The end.All right, that was an excellent story. Okay, so here is one more short sequence of pictures. And, again, I want you to look at the pictures and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.There was a boy named Bo, and he was practicing for soccer tryouts. He was practicing and practicing for hours when he let the ball get a little out of control, and it went sailing through the neighbor's window. The glass shatters, and his neighbor, who's watching TV, is scared to death because the ball comes flying through the window and knocks over the lamp. He gets up, and he goes looking for, of course, who kicked the ball through the window, but he can't find them. So he he patches the window and goes back to watching TV."

And they, of course, went back, and my husband and I were in the waiting room and they that my son in law came out and he said, we're in a birthing room, and you all can come back and visit a little while. So we went back, and of course, Pam was in bed, and she was fine and laughing, and we were all talking, and all of a sudden, she had pain, which that happens.And her father immediately jumped up, and he said, I'll go back out to the waiting room. And I said, okay, we'll do that then. He wasn't good, seeing his baby daughter suffer. And so we got up to go back out, and my son in law got a very stricken look on his face, and he said, you're not going to leave me, are you? And I said, oh, darling, you don't want me here.This is a very special time for you and Pam. You certainly don't want your mother in law here. He said, yes, I do. And Gordon said, why don't I go back to the apartment, and you stay here with the children, and then you can call me when it gets here and tell me what it is. And I looked at Rick, and he said, yeah, why don't you do that?And I said, well, all right, if you were sure. Well, it took all night long, and Rick was on one side of her bed, and I was on the other side, and we just had the most delightful evening. Pam wasn't enjoying it all that much, but Rick and I were. And when the baby really started to come, and the doctor was there, and of course, I was still there, and Rick was still there, and I wanted it to be a girl. I was an only girl.My daughter was my first child, and she was a girl. And we're all named for my father. We carried his family name down, and I wanted this one, the first grandchild, to be a girl, so I could have the name carried down again. And Pam had an ultrasound, and they told him it was boy. And she was so afraid I was going to be disappointed.And I was looking and looking and trying to see. And finally the doctor looked up at me, and he said, grandmother, if you'd move back just a little bit, I might be able to catch this baby when it comes out. So we laughed, and he did catch the baby, but when it came out, it was my girl, wasn't a boy. They made a mistake on the ultrasound, and, well, my name is Evelyn Brewersmith. Pamela is Pamela Brewersmith Foster, and that baby is was my and to be there and to actually see her born.Of course, the doctor gave her to Rick first, and then Rick gave her to me. And so I laughingly say I always love my son in law, but never quite as much as I did that night. He really became mine that night. So that's my big story. It."

        "transcript": "Okay, well, we have a nice little country scene that appears. How it started is that this little girl's cat ran up into her tree or ran up into this tree. She was riding along, riding her bicycle and I guess the cat was playing with her cat goes up into the tree, is not willing to come down own. So this man, we'll say it's her dad, decides to help her out and to climb up into the tree to rescue the kitty cat. Then this dog decides he's not happy about that.And so it's either barking at some combination of the bird, the man and the cat has somebody treed. I don't know that he really cares to.I guess the dog has probably also knocked this ladder over that the man used to climb up into the tree. And then because now everybody is stuck in the tree, the fire department has been called for them to come and rescue to help the little girl get her cat out of the tree and then to help the man get out of the tree without getting attacked by this dog. And this little bird is just over here not really giving a care about anything and is just enjoying the whole scene. So we will assume that all of this worked out nicely and everybody came down safe and sound. The cat is rescued, the man is no longer afraid, and the firemen have sufficiently done their duty.Thanks. You're welcome. Okay, the next two are sequences of pictures that tell a story. So I just want you to look at each picture and kind of just tell me about the story that you see there. Okay, test all in one.What do you see here?Okay. So Wes little boy is getting ready to leave for school. His mother has clearly checked the weather channel and is pretty sure that the weather is going to be bad. And so it's trying to offer him the umbrella to go to school or to use for school. Then he denies it, he doesn't want to use it, leaves for school without it.As he's walking to school, it starts to rain, he's getting a little wet, but it's no big deal. But then as he's coming home from school, no whatever, it's very wet and rainy. And so he's getting quite soaked, is walking through puddles, walks back into his house soaking wet, at which point his mother says, I told you so, and hands him the umbrella again to be able to leave and to stay dry on his walk to the school. Okay. All right, two more stories with this one and then another story if it doesn't have pictures.Okay, so in this one there is a guy kicking a soccer ball, just playing in his yard. Eventually, or as he's playing, kicks it a little too hard and knocks it into through a window in a house. As when it goes through the window it knocks over a lamp and scares the guy sitting on a couch. And then the guy that was inside now or has a soccer ball and is probably not happy with the kid who just kicked it through his window that he's going to have to replace the window and the lamp."

        "transcript": "Well, there once was a time with Cinderella and her two sisters and her evil mother.They lived near a kingdom where the king lived and his son, which was the prince.They were having a party and they were inviting Cinderella and her family to the kingdom for the ball.The letter came from the king and the mother told Cinderella she had to stay home and clean the house. She wasn't allowed to go to the ball. She was, I think, the ugly sister or the sister that didn't belong.So the mother and the two sisters went to the ball. Cinderella decided that she was going to go to the ball. She got her beautiful dress on and the fairy godmother showed up and turned her pumpkin and her rodents into a stagecoach. A pumpkin with horses. Cinderella went to the ball and their sisters and mother were very upset.Why she showed up to the ball. Prince saw her, fell in love with her first sight. They ended up dancing.When the clock struck twelve, she would turn back into Cinderella. With no beautiful dress. The pumpkin or the stagecoach would shrink back to a pumpkin and the animals would go back from horses to rodents.The prince was very upset. He couldn't find Cinderella. Cinderella ran out the door. She lost her slipper or her shoe. And the prince found it on the boardwalk.And he wanted to find out where this woman went to and who she was. She didn't ever got her name. And he searched the whole city, finally taking the shoe to every woman, to every house in the city. Finally he finds Cinderella. And the mothers and the daughters were so appalled, once he found Cinderella, he made her his queen.It and that's about."

        "transcript": "Well, the most recent thing that I could consider an illness because I've been fairly healthy as a person. It really wasn't an illness per se, but I used to run 35 40 miles a week, so I'm used to running. But a couple of years ago I was just running across the little grassy field and I started to speed up because it had started to rain and and as I was running I got this sudden pain in my left leg and I had to walk and walk with a little bit of pain back to the car. So when I got home I put some ice on my knee and didn't think a whole lot of it till the next couple of days. And what would happen then was that I would get excruciating pain at times when I would attempt to put my left foot down onto the ground and the pain would only be gone as I lift my leg off of the ground.I had no idea what was causing this, but the pain was so severe. I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer, but in this case you hit it with the hammer and it's gone. As long as I stood on that knee, that intense pain would be there. So I finally went to an Orthopedic doctor and after taking x rays and an MRI, they found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot handle tear where the femur had actually gone through and the meniscus was still totally intact, but it looked like a teapot where you have that slender handle above the top of it.And he said, well, that's going to continue to do that to your femur unless we go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery and you plan these surgeries and unfortunately things don't always go real well. I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day. I think this day it was 01:00 p.m.. So I got there, you had to go there an hour or so ahead of time.I ended up having it done at St. Joe's Hospital even though I was going to be an in outpatient. And I went in there and know, clean your leg up and everything. And it turns out though, that this particular set of surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up. So my appointment at one in the afternoon actually took place at six in the afternoon and they finally wheeled me into the room.Not having any idea what they were going to do, I'm pulled into the room and they put me off of the one bed onto the real bed and I feel these doctors like grabbing my leg and slamming it up against this rubber mount to the left of my leg. And I knew that they were going to do arthroscopic surgery, but I had not had any inkling about how this would all happen. In fact, I thought it might been so simple, I had asked him to just numb the leg."

        "transcript": "She turned the pumpkin into the coach, and the mice, who were friends and playmates of Cinderella, were there to draw the coach, and the cat was there to guide the coach. They get to the ball and rela meets the Prince. She has a dance with the Prince, and the Prince doesn't want to see anyone else. He is enjoying himself so much, but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight, you will become the same Cinderella that you were before. No matter where you are, you need to come home.So as the clock was striking the midnight, she ran from the ball and ran from the Prince. On her way out, she lost her slipper, one of her glass slippers. She got to her coach and it immediately turned back into the pumpkin, and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat. She made her way home, wondering if she would ever see the Prince again. As it turned, the Prince was so excited about this pretty young woman that he wanted to meet her.He had kept the glass slipper and knew that he had to see her again. So he sent out a decree to look for the young woman who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper, that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her.All of the women, the young women, decided to go and try the slipper, but none of them could make it fit, including her sisters, cousins.So eventually she was able to go and see the Prince and try on the slipper. And the Prince announced that this was the woman that he would marry, and they all lived happily ever after.Well, at the very beginning, there was a bird that was hopping around in the yard, and little girl's cat started chasing after the bird. Well, somewhere along the line, the commotion was recognized by a neighbor's dog, and the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree.The bird was in the tree. The cat was in the tree. The little girl called for her father. He came over with a ladder and got up in the tree to try and get the cat down. Well, the ladder fell, so now he was trapped in the tree, and the little girl was hoping the cat would come down.The neighbor, seeing all this, had called the fire department, who showed up with another ladder to try and helped the man and the cat down off the tree. And they all lived happily ever after."

        "transcript": "I can tell you. Okay, I'm ready. So this was actually my sophomore year in college. I'm with a bunch of my buddies. My best friend Tal is with me.We go to this party, at this party, a friend of mine is playing beer pong. His name is Harry. He's a crazy, crazy kid. He has like I think he's a manic depressive and bipolar. He's crazy, he's insane.Like, he'll go off the walls. So he's playing beer pong at this party in the backyard and there's all people crowding around the table and big party and he wins, he wins the game or I think he either wins the game or scores a point. And he goes, yeah. And he rips off his shirt and another guy standing kind of next to Tal and I in the middle of the table is kind of like, what the heck is know? He kind of says a curse know, what the f are you doing?And everything else. And Harry's like, what are you talking about? And then Tal my friend, best friend, standing next to me and he turns to like I don't remember what he said too much, but he was kind of like trying to put him in his place, tell him, you better watch yourself, you better shut up or something. And the kid starts to get in his face and kid's much bigger than towel, he's about the same size as me. And he gets in his face and he's like they're starting to argue and it's getting heated.And all the while when things start to get bad like that or when things get scary or when I get scared, the thing that I always do is I get very quiet. And I don't mean to do it, but I kind of do, like I heighten my senses, I feel everything heightened and I just listen and look and feel and try to take in as much as I can. And I get ready and make a long story short, the kid gets in his face and I simply my friend's house. Short means like five seven, about that, about five seven.I put my head kind of closer to his nearest shoulder and I just sit there looking at the guy and standing next to Talon. And I'm scared because I don't like fighting. I don't ever want to see fighting. I don't want to see a punch thrown. I don't want to see even in my mind, we had a lot more people at the party that we knew he didn't.I mean, really, we knew that it could have been bad for him, but I still didn't want to see anyone get hurt. So I'm getting scared and I just stand there calmly and quietly and don't lose my cool, even though I'm nervous and looking at the kid and just waiting for him to take a swing of town. Because then Tal knows and I know that we're going to go buck wild on him. And it's not like I'm a big guy or bad guy. That's how I feel.I'm getting ready to jump in the you know, they eventually go back and forth, and everyone says stuff, and eventually, I think Tal says TAL's like, dude, seriously, you better get out of here. You better stop because you're way outnumbered right now. You have nobody with you. And the guy's like, no, but eventually it just quiets down. I still stood my ground next to Tal and made sure he was safe.And the guy eventually slowly leaves. Everything calms down, and it ends, and that's it."

        "transcript": "All right. It's a beautiful summer day, and Sam was glad school was finally out. He did what he loves most and was to play soccer. He took his ball out and was kicking it along, walking along down his neighborhood street, when suddenly, one swift kick and crash, the ball came crashing through his neighbor's window. The neighbor is taking him by surprise when the ball comes sailing in and lands on his lap.As he's relaxing on the couch, he picks up the ball, walks over to the window and looks out. Who could have kicked that ball? He couldn't see anyone. Must be that neighbor boy that's always out in the yard with his soccer ball. Must be him.I'm going to call his parents immediately. First I'm going to pick up the glass off the Scout and get it cleaned up, and then I'll call them and find out what's going on. He calls the neighbors.Mr. Smith picks up the phone, and the man says, is your son missing a soccer ball? Because I see some initials here. Jr. Isn't your son James Robb?And Mr. Smith says yes. What happened? Did you find his ball? Said, yes, I found it in my living room.It came right through my glass. Mr. Smith said, I'll take care of it. He calls his son and says, james Rob, are you missing your soccer ball? James said, no, I have about ten soccer balls.If I'm missing one, I wouldn't really notice it. His dad says, well, our neighbor found one on his lap. It had sailed through his window, and he is livid because it broke his window. Could that possibly be your ball? Well, no, dad, that couldn't possibly be my ball.I was out kicking the ball today, but I don't remember it going through anybody's window. And he said, well, that's a shame, because your initials are marked on the ball on the sharpie. Remember, I reminded you to do that so you wouldn't lose them, and your initials are on the ball.Wow. I was too afraid to tell anybody, dad, I'm sorry. What should we do? And he said, well, the first thing you need to do is to get some money from your piggy bank and take it over and offer to pay for his window. And then I think that you better apologize and never kick the ball out near his yard again.Okay, dad. That's what I'll do. Sorry, dad. Said, well, you've learned a lesson. Next time an accident happens, come straight to me and tell me, and we'll take care of it.But don't ever hide from your responsibilities. Okay, dad, I will. So the next day, they went over to the neighbor or that evening excuse me. They went over to the neighbor's house.James Robb brought his piggy bank, and he said he was willing to pay for the broken window and said how sorry he was. Neighbor said don't worry. My homeowner's insurance covers it. I know it was an accident. I appreciate your honesty and your integrity for coming forth.By the way, when's your next soccer game? I'd really like to come and see. You've got quite a kick. So all ended well for the family? The end?It."

But she shows up and meets her new stepmother and the wicked stepsisters, and instead of welcoming her, they treat her as a maid, and she has to serve them, et cetera.And they basically are rather abusive.Down the road, the wicked stepmother gets an invitation to the ball. And the ball is so that the prince can be looking for a wife because his father thinks it's time. So Cinderella thinks she's going to go, and everybody's all busy getting dressed and buying new things, and she's making do out of the attic with what she can find. And when the stepsisters see her in her homemade dress, the stepmother says she can't go. So they all take off for the ball.And in the meantime, the mice and the fairy godmother appear and pull together a pumpkin carriage and horses and a beautiful gown for her. And off she goes to the ball. I know I'm missing things, but she appears at the ball and the prince is taken with her, and she has on these beautiful shoes, and all is fine. And he is doting on her until she has to be back by midnight because the spell will wear off. And all of a sudden, it's almost midnight.She hears the bell ringing and runs down the steps and loses one of the beautiful glass slippers she's wearing. So the next day, she gets home in time, but the next day, the prince is broken hearted. He wants this lady, and all he has is a slipper. So they go around the town with the slipper, trying it on everyone, and of course, the sisters think it's going to fit them, so they're up for trying. But the age of the prince puts a slipper on her foot, on Cinderella's foot, and it fits perfectly and all is undone.And she ends up wedding the prince and lives happily ever after. And your final prompt for today is as follows. Please tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay, well, first you need a loaf of bread, and you need two pieces of bread, preferably white bread. And then you need peanut butter, preferably without sugar added, and jelly.Strawberry is my favorite. And you need a knife. And you will spread some peanut butter with the knife onto both sides of the bread. Well, one side of each piece, I should say. And then you will take a clean knife and put the jelly on the peanut butter and put the two halves together, being careful it doesn't ooze out and drip.And there you have it. Peanut butter and jelly sandwich."

And then the dog came, but he couldn't climb the tree, so he just had to stand at the base barking and even a little bluebird came, but she also couldn't help, so she is just singing. His daughter came running and jumped off her tricycle, but she can't reach anyone. But thankfully she told her mom, who was also there, and the mom actually ran indoors and called the fire department.So the fire men have just arrived and they are about to help dad and the kitty out of the tree."

The stepmother to his daughter didn't want her in the same category as her two daughters, so basically turned her into a scullery maid to do housework and wait on everyone else in the household. The father along the way had after a few years had died in the meantime. So mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters.It came about that the king and queen had a son, a prince if you will, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, and they decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible girls in the country to come to the ball. So naturally, the stepmother of Cinderella, who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters, since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace to come to this ball, mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible. So she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go. Cinderella was very sad because she couldn't go and she really wanted to go. She never got to do anything.She happened to stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and found that she actually had some friends in the animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown. She also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about, who suddenly appeared and helped make everything right so that Cinderella could go to the ball. She had a beautiful gown, she had a coach to ride in with footmen and everything that she needed. The only stipulation was she had to be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before. So Cinderella went to the ball, was having a wonderful time, and forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight.She ran down the stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers, which was a beautiful glass slipper. She did make it home on her own and no one ever found out. But in the meantime, the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase. So he went door to door in the country with his helpers, trying to find whose foot would fit into this glass slipper. No one's had so far, but when he came to the home of Cinderella, her two sisters of course had to try it on.They could not get their foot in there. And Cinderella happened over here and came out of hiding and tried on the slipper. And the prince had found his princess and they got married and live tampily ever after."

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and unfortunately, her father passed away, and she was sent to live with her stepmother and stepsisters, who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful. And they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun. As she got older, her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house. House on the farm.One day, the King decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son, to try to find a wife for his son, because he was getting older, and he wanted to make sure that somebody would be able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as King. So couriers went across the land and delivered the message or delivered invitations to all the eligible bacheloretes or unmarried women in the kingdom. And the stepsisters were very excited, and Cinderella was excited, too. But then they laughed at her, saying, you can't go to the ball. You don't have a dress.You're just a scrub girl. And Cinderella was very sad about that. But her friends, the animals, made a dress for her so she could go to the ball. Unfortunately, her stepsisters were very jealous of her, and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball. So they ripped the dress up, and Cinderella was sent down to the cellar, and she cried.And then all of a sudden, a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying. And she told her story to the fairy godmother, and the fairy godmother waved her wand, and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with glass slippers, and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin, and it turned into a beautiful carriage, and she waved her wand over the mice, and the mice turned into horses. So Cinderella arrived at the royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress. She met the Prince, and they danced the night away. But the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out till midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight.So Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight, and she ran away. And the Prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her, but he couldn't catch up with her. Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her glass slippers on the stairs. She made it to the carriage and got home just in time, and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin, and the mice turned back, or the horses turned back into mice. The Prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because his heart belonged to her now.So he sent couriers across the land again with the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper, and then he would know who was the beautiful woman at the ball. So when the courier got to Cinderella's house, the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slippers on. But unfortunately, the slippers didn't fit either one of them. And Cinderella came out of the cellar and sat down. And the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at the royal ball, and so brought her back to the castle, and she and the prince live happily ever after."

You take two slices of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, and you spread peanut butter take a knife and you spread peanut butter on one side, and then you spread jelly on the other side and you put the two pieces together.Today is Johnny's 8th birthday and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing Happy Birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him. As when Mommy and Johnny stepped out of the kitchen, they walked back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken chunk. There was a big bite taken out of the cake, and they looked to see that the prince led right to the dog under the couch. Mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrived. And Johnny cried as the guests walked in, they said, oh my, what are we going to do now?But the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything. So the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home. In fourth grade, I was outside during recess in New York, and as you may or may not know, we play in the streets, in the public schools anyway. In the inner city, we don't have a playground, so they put up the barriers and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street. So I was standing against one of the cars and a friend of mine ran right into me and my wrist went right around the rear view mirror and broke.So they called my mom, and my mom came and I was just crying, and she rushed me to the doctor. I think we took the bus because she didn't want to pay for ambulance. So I'm in pain on the bus, I'm crying, I'm trying to keep it still and got to the hospital and they had to put a cast on me. And that was my first time having a cast and got back to school and all my friends signed it, so that was cool. And then the part that I didn't like so much was when itched inside.And so I remember one time my mom used one of the straws from the broom to try and itch, and it broke in there. So then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to it. And that was about all I remember about that. And then I remember using it as a weapon too. If somebody bothered me, I'd hit them with it, but then I would feel it too.It yeah, that was my first experience with the cast."

So I guess the standard story would be the cat climbed into the tree and Roy wasn't having any problems, but the girl was really concerned that the cat is trapped in the tree and there end up being a cat skeleton up there in a few days. So she got her dad, and her dad climbed up on the tree and couldn't really quite get out as far as the cat. Meanwhile, the dog knocked over the ladder that dad used to climb up the tree and is kind of angry with dad.Somebody used a cell phone and called the fire department because somehow the fire department knows about it. They're coming with hopefully, a longer ladder to rescue the cat and the dog from the tree. And the bird is laughing."

Eventually the king wanted to find a wife for his son. So he throws a ball. Everyone in the kingdom is invited to the ball.Cinderella's stepsisters and the stepmother are invited. They all are getting ready to go. She's also making preparations to go, makes her own dress and gets all those things ready. Except then, right as they're getting ready to leave that her stepmother and stepsisters tear apart everything that she's done and won't let her go with them, leave her at home to do work and be locked up. So then her fairy godmother appears and creates a wonderful dress and carriage and horsemen and horses and everything for her to be able to go to the ball.She goes, meets the prince. They dance, fall in love, of course, in a single evening.But then part of one of the caveats of the very godmother spell was that it ended at midnight. And so then as the start clock starts to start, clark clock starts to strike twelve, she goes through or realizes what time it is and that she's about to turn back into her peasant self and her character is going to become a pumpkin and such. And so she just takes off out of the castle, no real explanation, loses one of her glass slippers that the fairy gather has given her. In the process, she makes it all the way back to her house and is enjoying reliving the evening memories of it goes through and continues with her servant duties. And then obviously the prince wants to find this woman that he fell so madly in love with and so sets out on a search through the whole kingdom to find this girl.And eventually the duke and arrives at the house of Cinderella. But her stepmother has locked her away in the tower so that she can't come down and be a part of it. So the stepsisters are trying to get the shoe on in order to become the queen. And so it's not working. Not working.Eventually the duke has just decided to give up and is going back to the castle. In the process, the stepmother also breaks the glass slipper that the duke had been carrying around.

Then Carl comes up with a bunch of grapes, which he holds up so the little boy can take them and eat them one at a time. Then we have Carl. He gets the Hershey syrup, which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it.Holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup. Then Carl goes and gets the milk, opens the milk container, pours it in on top of the Hershey's syrup. And now we have chocolate milk. Now we go to the cookie jar, and Carl takes the lid off. The little boy knows exactly what to do.That little right hand goes in that cookie jar so fast, and out it comes. Now we have a real pile in the middle of the kitchen floor. We have a Hershey syrup pan. We have an open cookie jar. We have a milk looks like cream, not milk open on the floor.We have pieces of bread. We have a stick of butter. And we have something that looks like it might be jam and a big puddle in the middle of the floor. Of course, the little baby has chocolate all over. And when he has strawberry jam on his knees and he's just a picture.So the next picture, he's back up. Dirty little boy back up on Carl's back. They're going upstairs. They go into the bathroom. Carl turns on the water, takes the baby by the back of his shirt, puts it in the tub, gets a soap and a washcloth, lathers it up, washes baby.He gets some soap in his mouth. Carl does, and he starts blowing bubbles. Oh, a little baby thinks that's just really funny. So then Carl gets the blow dryer out. He dries the baby, who thinks this is fun.He just looks at that. He just loves it. And then the next picture, we have the baby being boosted over the side of the crib by Carl. Now Baby's back in his crib.

The cat got up in the tree and she couldn't get him to come back down, so her dad went out to try and help, got the ladder, climbed the tree, then the ladder fell over. So he's now stuck in the tree with the cat. And the dog is barking, but he can't really climb the tree to help. So the firemen have showed up with a tall all ladder to save the man and the cat.To make peanut butter and jelly sandwich, first you need a really good high quality sprouted grain bread, maybe something like Ezekiel's, if you're still eating bread. So then you take two slices and you want to get a nice high quality peanut butter, preferably just peanuts, maybe a little bit of salt, nice, organic. And then you can spread the peanut butter on one slice. And then for your jelly, you could actually use preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself. So it's got really pure, high quality ingredients and you would just place some of that on the other slice.And then you introduce the two slices to each other and you have the sandwich.In elementary school, I was rollerblading with my aunt and she took off down a hill and I went behind her and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone. But I didn't really feel it at all. I didn't feel any pain or anything. I was just happy. I had avoided the car that was in the way.But when I looked down and saw all the blood, that's when I realized, like, oh. And then I kicked into like a pain association. So I had to go get stitches. And a large man carried me into a wheelchair. Awkward.Um, on my friend's birthday, she was a little bit intoxicated and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front. And I think she was pretty spun on something else. And she was just shouting, having fights with everybody. So she came over and attacked us. And my friend was she was trying to attack one of my friends.So we were trying to get in the way and stop her from doing that. And during the whole commotion, as we were trying to separate this really upset woman, a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with like, side smack. And then he was actually because my friend then got really pissed off because that was her boyfriend and she was just kind of screaming and he was about to knock her out. So that was a little bit high tension. Had to break that up.And it I've had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they can't really have a genuine conversation with you because they can't get around their own just very self oriented, kind of selfish in a way. You can't really have a two person conversation because they don't move past a certain point in their mind. They'll just loop the track and go right back to another place."

        "transcript": "The only significant injury I've had is my little finger. And many, many years ago, I was just running out to block a pass, and the football just struck my little finger just right and had a compound dislocation. And the little finger I'd run back to the huddle. I didn't know go back to the huddle. And I'm standing there, and I'm looking down, and here's the finger sticking out and big white bones sticking out side of the finger.Well, this is not good. And this was in high school. And back then he had to go to a school nurse first for anything. And so then she took a look at it and obviously sent me to the school doctor. Doctor said it it wasn't broken, it was just dislocated.And he just pulled it out and pushed it back together and put a big splint on it. Fine. And two weeks whenever it went by and go to the doctor, and the doctor says, well, now we have to start bending this finger because otherwise it will get stiff. So I stick my hand out there and he bends it, and I'm going through the roof. This is not a good thing.Oh, come on. He says, come on, this can't be hurting that much. Come on, we got to bend it one more time. One more time. I stick my hand out there, and he's going nuts because he's mad because this is hurting, but he's not having that.He puts Banny back on and said, we'll come back in a week and we'll look at it again a week later. Come back. We got to bend your finger, Kim. Stick it out there. No, not doing one more time.I'm not sticking my finger out there again. We're not bending that finger anymore. And he just threw all the stuff down and discussed and said, well, get out here and find so by now I'm at the University of Iowa. So I go to Student Health over there, and they send me to the Orthopedic group there, and they determine, well, there's nothing they can do. The bones are laying side by side.They've been laying side by side for so long that all they can do is cut the knuckle out and pin it back together so you have a little shorter finger, and they put a little curve in it. And as it turns out, I believe it would have been a lot better if I just had them cut it off, because when you make the fist, I can't bend that finger. So you don't have a lot of strength in that finger either. I think if they'd have cut that off, I'd have had a lot more strength, and it's just favoring that finger so much over the years. I think that's what's causing my writing problem, screwed up my muscles in my hand.That's the only major it's a really major accident. That's the most beach or thing I have."

So anyway, at that point the company offered him the opportunity to go to Europe and work and do his job there because they needed somebody to be doing that. And so after a lot of discussion, we decided that we would do that. So he went over first. In 1998, we sold our house.The school I was teaching at was partly residential so I got a job working in the dorm and living there. Our son went off to college and our daughter was already finishing up advanced degree. So I lived in Vermont for another year and then I went over. After our daughter got married that June and I finished my teaching job, I went over to join my husband in Switzerland and we lived in a little village outside of Zurich. And in Switzerland you don't have any urban sprawl or anything, so you have these little villages that are just kind of compact and self contained.Not that they have that much there. I mean, there's really just usually a small store, a post office and so we lived there for a year and during that time it turned out that they really needed John to move to France. And of course I was a French teacher and I had lived in France as a student and so moving to France was of course like a dream come true for me. And so we ended up moving to France and lived there. We lived in a city called Lyle, which is about an hour north of Paris and I was just in heaven.Just can't even tell you how much I loved being there. And my husband did too, although his French was not as good as mine, although it got a whole lot better as we were there in Zurich, they speak German, but it's Swiss German and most people speak English. So anyway, I ended up teaching English and we had a wonderful time. Everybody that we knew practically came to visit us and we did a lot of traveling around Europe at the time and so it was just a fabulous experience. And then we came back in 2003 right as the Iraq the invasion of Iraq happened.And I ended up getting a job in Ohio where I ended up teaching at the high school that Brittany Stark went to.

He couldn't believe how pretty she was. How beautiful she was and how she could dance and everything else. And he thought in the back of his mind, I've seen this young lady before somewhere. I don't remember where it was, but I've seen her.That's Nice. She's a very nice lady. Well, it started after the dance was going on. The time drew nigh for her to go and get closer and closer to midnight. So she said she had to leave.She had to run. She ran down the steps, and in the process, she lost one of her slippers, which happened to be a glass slipper, a very fancy glass slipper for her small foot. She jumped into the carriage. They raced back. And just about the time they got back to the house, the time struck midnight.The carriage disappeared. It turned into a pumpkin. The mice were there. She went on inside. I don't know what happened to the dress.I guess the dress turned into an old rag again that she'd been wearing anyway. And she went on back in very happy that she had got an opportunity to go to the ball.

So they were going around knowing it would be too big, too small to this, to that, to the other thing. They came to this house.And of course, the fairy godmother excuse me, not the fairy godmother, but her stepmother invited them to come in and said, oh, here are my two daughters. You should try them on. Then they certainly would fit them. Well, they couldn't get it on. It wouldn't go on their feet.They pushed and tugged and did everything else and it wouldn't work. And they looked around. They saw Cinderella. They said. Well, how about her?And she said, oh, no, she just amazed. We said it'll make a difference. The Prince said every girl in this kingdom will try on that slipper. So she sat down. The slipper popped on.To the amazement of the guards that had come and his people that were checking it out, she was the one that the slipper would fit.

And within 20 hours, I was in Rome, Italy, and my husband and I decided that one of us should go to help her and to help her with her husband. And I arrived hoping that I could do something to get them counseling, whatever. Within 24 hours, he had called the police of Rome. I was alone with him in the house, and I had no help.And I didn't know how to get a hold of my daughter. And the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail. And I immediately thought, wonder if I can take my pillow or should I take my Sudoku game? Because if I have to sit in that police with the police in jail, what am I going to know? And then I started trying to call my daughter's friends, finding out how I can get a hold of Susan.And I kept dialing the numbers wrong because I think when you're nervous, you dial the wrong thing. I finally got a hold of my daughter, and she came and we called the carvag, and the carvaniere came to help me. And I'm not sure if I was afraid. I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail. And I was willing to fight for everything I was worth to make it happen my way.And since then, we were trailed. Our phone was tapped, the computer was compromised. We wrote to each other, sitting on the sofa, trying to write notes so that nobody would hear what we were saying. And we took care of a year and a half year old during this time. And I'm not sure if I was really afraid because I thought it was idiotic what was happening, but that was probably the most resourceful that I ever had to be to protect my daughter and grandson."

My wedding was a very important event in my life. It was lovely. Okay, so we got married in the summer. It was a very hot and sticky day in July, and we were married in a church.And it was a really extraordinary in my mind, who wouldn't say that ceremony, because my husband's father had little over a year before that been diagnosed with leukemia, a rare form of leukemia, and we knew that he was not going to live a lot longer. And, in fact, no, it was not even yeah, so it was less than a year that he had been diagnosed, but he was undergoing treatments. He was well enough to come to the wedding, and he was the best man for my husband at the wedding. So rather than being just the father of the groom, he stood by my husband. And partly it was because of that and partly because my husband and I were so thrilled to be marrying one another, we stood at that altar and simply sobbed while we said our vows to one another.I mean, it was just so emotional. We just stood there and sobbed with one another, and it was just as if all the world was gone and we were zoned in. But knowing how significant of an event it was, because it was the last significant big event like that of his dad's life."

And so they're going to have a big ball to introduce him to all of the eligible ladies of the kingdom. So everyone is invited, and Cinderella is all excited because she assumes that she will get to go, too.When it comes time for the ball, she has no clothes, no dress to wear. So the furry friends help her make a dress, and she hurries up and gets the sisters together, gets them ready, goes and finds her dress, puts it on, and they go, those are my things. You can't have them. And they tear the dress off of her. And so she goes crying into the garden as the two ugly stepsisters go off to the ball in the carriage, the fairy godmother comes, says, oh, sweetie, you're destined to go to the ball, so we'll fix you up, but you must leave before the stroke at midnight.So she taps her wand, and there's a beautiful dress, and the glass slippers, and the pumpkin becomes a carriage, and the mice become footmen. And I forget who becomes the mice become the horses, and the dog becomes the footman. And they go off to the ball, and she dances with the prince until the stroke of midnight. And when it starts to ring, the clock starts to ring. She remembers she was supposed to leave, and she says, oh, I must go.I must go. And she goes tearing down the steps, loses a shoe, gets home, has the other shoe, and when they come look for her, she produces the shoe, and she is the new princess."

It was either maybe his house or the neighbor's house.The soccer ball went through the window and knocked over the lamp, and it looks like the guy's face is very surprised. He takes the soccer ball and looks out the window and is probably going to go talk to the boy. Okay, great. Same thing with these pictures. And then whenever you're ready, I'll have you tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay.So there's a little boy that is, and his mom is trying to give him an umbrella before he goes outside. The little boy shakes his hand and says, no, I don't want the umbrella, and goes outside without the umbrella. And it starts to rain. It rains on him and gets him all wet, and he's going through the puddles, and it's raining really hard, and he's trying to cover his head, probably wishing he had the umbrella. When he gets back home, mom has a very certain look on her face, and the kid is soaking wet and looks like he's probably learning a lesson to listen to what mom said.So the next time he goes out, he carries his umbrella and learns his lesson. Okay. And same thing with this one. It's kind of an entire scene. So take a look at the whole thing, and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Okay.Well, it looks like first, it looks like two things are happening at the beginning. It looks like a cat got stuck in a tree and a dog ran a man up the tree and they're both stuck.Somebody called the fire department so the little girl can get her cat down and so they can maybe get the man down. It looks like they before they tried before they called the firemen, they tried to maybe use a ladder, but it looks like it was too short.And after they called the firemen, the firemen came in, and they are going to get the cat down and get the man down who was run up by the dog, and everyone will go home and be happy. And the maybe the cat knows and the mammal learn their lesson not to climb the trees."

        "transcript": "The bases are safe spots where they cannot be out. If they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. So that's another way that an out can be generated.Let's see, the way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from 1st, 2nd, third and then touches back onto home play. That's one point or one run. I just mentioned that there's a field beyond the diamond. There's usually a fence behind those players that are in the outfield. It's called the outfield.If the batter hits the ball over that outer fence, then it's a home run. And so he gets a free unimpeded trip around from each base and that's a point. If the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around and he scores a point and then the batters gets a point. So it's a two run home run. So you try to get more points or runs before all of your 27 outs are exhausted.If both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the 9th inning, then it's kind of a sudden death. Like whoever gets the most runs where both teams equally have a chance to score runs, after that, they win the game. So if you're tied in the 9th and then the visiting team comes up first because they start the game, they start batting, they score a run, then they get three outs. The other team doesn't score, they get their chance. They get three outs with no runs, then the visiting team has won the game.There's no time. The games can conceivably last forever. The only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points. Some of the strategies that people employ are you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball. And there's different types of pitchers.There's some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow. And then you also want your defense, every position, to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. Because if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm, can throw the ball to first base and before that batter gets there, then they're valuable for the offensive team. Some skills that you want is you want someone that is strong, that has really good hand eye coordination and that can hit the ball far and hard.Some specialized players, they're skilled at speed. So if you have someone that is marginal hitting but he's fast and they can hit the ball, but they're fast to first base and can get there before the other team is able to get the ball, then that's a valuable position as well. That's basically the juice of the."

And she already has two daughters, so he introduces them and the stepmother looks at Cinderella like she was a bad dream or something. Them at any rate, you could tell from her face that she wasn't going to be a very kind stepmother. So right away she put Cinderella to work, waiting on everybody and doing everything in the book that I knew when I was a child.She cleaned out cinders from the fireplace. But they don't do that anymore. But she waited on everybody. She was a servant. And the girls were top drawer in the house.And there is a picture in that book that looks as if maybe it's the king ranting and raving because his son needs to have a wife. So they have a ball. And the general idea is to introduce the prince to the eligible young ladies. And the two stepdaughters get all dressed up and get ready to go. Cinderella is not going to be allowed to go.And while everything is going on the ball and everything, there's a little cute little plump lady who turns out to be the fairy godmother, comes and tells Cinderella that they're to go up in the attic and she will find a dress that she can wear and go to the ball. So Cinderella goes up the attic. She gets the dress. This fairy godmother makes a coach out of a pumpkin and she makes horses out of mice.

She would hold things in, and you could just feel the energy that she was upset, but she wouldn't talk about it. I asked her on numerous occasions, too, if we could talk about it, if something was bothering her.She always said no. And then she kind of passively aggressively started not participating in things or just kind of being rude, I guess. So it finally broke my last little straw, and I yelled at her one day and kicked her out of the group. So that's what I did about it. Okay, well, I'm afraid of heights, even little heights, even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder.So I decided one year to get my boyfriend skydiving thing jump, I guess that's what you call it, a jump for his birthday. And then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too, and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights. So we went skydiving, and it was terrifying. And when we jumped out of the plane, you're attached to someone else. So when we jumped out of the plane and we were free falling, I stopped breathing for, like, an entire minute while we were free falling because I was just, like, so terrified.And then the parachute opens, and then you start gliding, which is kind of nice. That was better. That was a little bit more like being a bird and flying. So that was nice for a little bit. And then we landed, and then that was that.And I said, I'm glad I did it and I'll never do it again. And I'm still afraid of heights.So the story starts with the flood. There's lots and lots of rain, which is flooding out the city. And the woman has gotten caught in the flood, probably because she went looking for her cat to save her cat from the flood and the rains. So she got caught in the flood, she got swept downstream, and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out. And she's been hanging there, waiting for someone to come save her.Someone saw her, called the fire department, and now the firemen are there, and one of them has made his way out to the water with the life vest on, and it's probably going to try and strap her to him. I think that's what that looks like to get her out of the water.And that's the end. It okay. The boy is playing soccer outside. He kicks the ball really hard. It goes crashing into the window.It crashes through the window into the lamps that's next to the man sitting there. He jumps up, he grabs the ball, and he is looking out the window to see."

But anyway, I went through life pretty much no problem with it.Well, as I grew older, I got about my thirty s.I was having problems digesting food and I was having problems with my bite eating because my teeth were moving around. So anyway, I went and they suggested that I have my jaw reset and they did and that was quite interesting. We were in San Antonio, Texas at the time, and I wasn't in the military, but I went to Fort Sam Houston Hospital for the surgery to set my jaw back. And this was in the was just after we had landed on the moon.Well, not just after, but a few years afterwards. But anyway, they had come up with a lot of new surgical techniques in dental area. Not just that area, but all other areas too. But the one thing they came up with, anytime they deal with surgical procedures with the teeth or the mouth or anything like that, it can become very infectious. So they found a procedure where they put you underwater and do the surgery.I don't remember being underwater, but I do remember when I came out, the surgery they had done because they had moved my jaw back some. And of course, they had wired my jaw closed, my mouth closed and had me all stitched up and everything and took about six or eight weeks before they could take the wires out of my jaw so that I could eat normally. But during that time we had a deal where my family and I always went out to a Mexican restaurant for dinner and we did it just about every Friday night. We told the gal who ran the restaurant, we became friends of hers and told her that I was going to have this surgery and stuff and I wouldn't be able to eat, they're going to wire my jaw. And she said, don't worry about it.She said, I'll just go ahead and take your meal, make you a Mexican milkshake. And she did. She put it in a blender and added some milk and put it in like a milkshake cup. I drank it. I could take food through a straw and I couldn't chew food, I mean, had to be liquid and it was frustrating at times, but that was one of the things that I remember most about doing was of course, when you can't eat, you remember that."

The most memorable day was the day our son was born. But I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how interesting that all was, we were students at Montclair State in those days. Freshmen still had to wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures. And in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus, we had to sing the alma mater.But the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at lifehall. And he noticed the sign and said something about I think I had part of it was covered. And he said, Are you a speech major? And I said, no English. And I unveiled the words English.But he was a senior and I was a freshman. And so I got to meet one of the upper classmen, got his signature, and then later it was an easy conversation. We talked a little. He continued whenever I saw him, to say hi, and people were telling me he's a BMOC. He was a vice president of student government.And I said, oh, my goodness. But the more we had to talk about I was a student leader in my high school, and I thought when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee. It turned out that he was interested. So our first date, I think, was something like the Kingston Trio or something like that. Some folk group.It was really nice. They were on campus, and Joe had probably arranged for them to come. That was one of his duties. But when I just think of how all that unfolded, just I knew I was going to finish school. And so we paced ourselves, I guess, to be logical about things, get to know each other.No surprises along the way because you have time with a person and you see them in all the seasons. But I think when it finally came to getting married, I don't think there was a formal people ask us about this was not even a formal proposal. I think everyone around us assumed we would marry, so we did. And so I wasn't engaged. I was pinned.And someone said to me the next day, you know, you're engaged to be engaged. I said no, I'm not. And they said, well, that's what that means. I said, oh, I thought it meant sort of going steady college style. They said, no, you're engaged to be engaged.And I said, wow, we have some time to go before I said, it means what it means to the individual couple too. So I tried to assert myself, but I guess it might have been right. But I don't care. It didn't mean anything. But when you think of turning points in how you meet and how paths cross.Probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married. And all that happened at once.

All of a sudden, the husband is sitting in the chair, looking very dejected, holding his head in his hand.His newspaper is now hanging from his left hand down onto the floor. All of a sudden, the door opens in the next frame and his wife comes back into the house. He greets her with open arms. She is crying. She's put her suitcase down on the floor.He is walking towards her with his arms open. He's put his arms around her, giving her a big hug when he looks outside the door and finds that she has smashed their car, presumably up against a tree.Good.One more set of questions.Why did the woman leave?Argument. How long did the woman plan to be gone? Overnight, at least.Why did the woman come back?She was in an accident. Why did the man hug the woman?Because she was upset.Okay. That's a tough. Because she was upset? Yes. She was upset.Because he was lovable? No, not because he was leaving. Because she was sick. I would say because she's upset.All right. You have to take all these tests yourself. Have you taken them all?All right. Yes. Anyway, now I'm going to tell you about a recent experience I had. Let me tell you about my last vacation. I drove to San Diego, California with three of my friends.It took about 6 hours to get there. We tried to go to the beach, but it was overcast our entire trip. We ended up going to the SeaWorld for one of the days and shopped the rest of the time. And we had a great time. Now, I want you to tell me what you did this past Christmas.What I did this past Christmas?This past Christmas I went up to Sedona on Thursday evening and spent Christmas with friends at house party in Sedona and came home the day after Christmas.We ate, we opened presents, we decorated trees."

It is now 04:00 in the afternoon and the kitchen floor is pretty much of a mess and so is the baby with chocolate all over him, all over the floor. There's cookies out of the cookie jar on the floor. It looks like there's strawberry jam, milk, peanut butter, all sorts of stuff. The baby gets back on back on the dog's back, covered with chocolate syrup and whatever else.The next scene is the dog turning on the water in the bathtub. Next scene, genderly leaving, picking up the baby by the back of the shirt. Again, same routine as in the aquarium. Puts soap on the wash rag and his mouth full of soap, scraps the baby off the baby sitting with the soap in his hand while the dog has the wash raid in his mouth and is getting the baby cleaned up. Then he takes the hairdryer, somehow turns plugs in and turns on the hairdryer to dry the baby and then gently nudges the baby back over the edge of the Raymond's crib.All you see is the diaper and feet sticking up. And the dog is tell what the dog is doing. Eating something, picking up the trash and putting it in the green trash can in the kitchen. Looking out at the milk from the floor of the kitchen.Rushes over to the window to look out. Putting his feet this time on a stool, looking out. Nothing yet. Runs back into the bedroom, makes the bed up very quickly. Goes back, puts the power puff back in the little power box run and looks back out the window, this time putting his paws on the window.Mother is coming back. No purse this time, just a coat and the red gloves. And the last scene is the baby back sleep in the crib with password and his mask and the dog laying on the floor looking very contrite.

So he turned her into a little maid and she had to run around, do all the work and wait on her sisters that were stepsisters and her stepmother. And they pretty much just made her into a little servant.She was very unhappy, but she didn't really know what else to do. There's nothing else she could do. Then they heard that there was going to be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son, the prince, who was they were trying to find a suitable bride for him. So they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoyfloy of the area. So the sisters decided they'd go.And at first Cinderella thought that she might go. But then they laughed at her and told know she didn't have anything to wear. She was not pretty, they weren't good. So they went to the ball. She was very sad, sitting among the cinders and her very godmother shows up, appears and tells her she'll get it all set for the ball.So she gives her a beautiful gown and turns a little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses. And I forget what she made her dress out of. So she goes to the ball and she gives her these beautiful glass slippers. So she goes to the ball and she meets the prince. And the prince falls madly in love with her because she's the most beautiful girl there.But the very godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was. So she saw midnight approaching, so she had to leave suddenly, the prince, she had to run away from him and hide and run away and jump in her carriage. And just as she got back, she jumped out of the carriage and everything turned back to what it was before. So she thought, well, that's going to be my one night of happiness, but I'll always remember it. She had left behind though as she was running out of the castle, she had left behind her glass slipper.And Prince had been running around trying to find her. And that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper. So he told his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper. So they went around to all the villages and they had the women who might possibly be Cinderella try on the glass slipper. So they got to the house of Cinderella and they asked her, how many girls do you have?No, I only have two. Because they had found out what was going on that they were having to try on this glass slipper. So she hid Cinderella's, forced Cinderella to stay inside her room. And they tried the slipper on to the other stepdaughters. And the first one, the heel was too big.So the mother said, no, it'll fit. And she took a knife and cut off part of the heel, but it still didn't fit. They tried on for this second one, but her toe was too big. And the mother said, no, no, it fits. And she cut off her toe in secret, but it still didn't fit.So they said, no, these aren't their shoes. So then they were leaving, and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there. I don't remember exactly what clued them into that. So they insisted on looking around, and they found Cinderella. And sure enough, they tried her.The shoe on her and it fit. So they took her back to the castle and she married the prince. And she was very forgiving. She brought her sisters to live with her."

And then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words.Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at.Cinderella was motherless and her father married a nasty woman who had two nasty girls, and they treated her like dirt. They made her do all the work in the house, and she was very unhappy.And the prince of the area was planning a ball and everybody he was looking for a wife. And all of the young ladies in the area were invited to come to the fall. And the wicked stepmother wouldn't let Cinderella go and left her at home to work. And all the animals and the birds and so on. Love, Cinderella.And they got together and tried to make her feel better. Made her a pretty dress to wear. But she still couldn't go to the ball until her fairy godmother appeared and waved a wand over her and made her beautiful in a gorgeous dress and glass slippers. She made her a carriage out of a pumpkin and Cinderella rode to the ball. But she was told she had to leave at stroke of midnight.So she went to the ball and her stepmother and her wicked stepsisters were very upset that she was there. She was not supposed to be there. And she, of course, was more beautiful than any of them. And she danced with the Prince and he fell in love with her. And when the clock struck midnight, she ran down the stairs so that she could get away when she was supposed to and left a glass slipper on the stairs.Prince sent a man from house to house to try the slipper on every girl's foot and the wicked stepmother, when he came to their house, tried to cram her daughter's feet into the glass slipper. And of course, they didn't fit. And she was she wasn't going to let Cinderella try the slipper, but the man insisted. So Cinderella tried the slipper and of course it fit and the prince came and claimed her. And they were happy ever after."

We see is Cinderella all dressed in a beautiful white gown with silver slippers. Well, the dog mother and the daughters are just completely upset, filled with all kinds of jealousy. But there's nothing they can do because the mice and the fairy godmother is not going to let anything upset her plans or Cinderella is going to have a good time. They even have a carriage come and take Cinderella to the ball in the carriage with a driver.Well, it shows that Cinderella meets the prince and she and the prince hit it off. Just great dancing and this and that. But there was a stipulation. There was a very big stipulation that Cinderella had to be gone by the time of the stroke of midnight, that the carriage would not be there, that she would lose her gown, and she would be dressed in her ordinary, just plain dowdy clothes. Well, she gets out of the castle and she just gets away from the prince.And the stroke of midnight comes. She looks at herself and she's rather in her servant's clothing. Well, one of the good things about this is the slipper had fallen off her shoe, her foot, and somebody had retrieved it and taken it to the prince. And the prince sent out people all over the kingdom to find the person that that shoe fitted. And one of the people, that person, one of the searchers came and knocked at the store that Cinderella was staying at.And he tries the shoe and the two daughters is there another girl here in this town? Yes, we have a servant here, Cinderella. But that one shoe wouldn't fit her. Of course they know that that she does because they'd seen her wearing it. That wouldn't fit her.And he says, well, I must insist. The prince has told me that I must try every foot in the kingdom. And sure enough, he tries her shoe. Foot on the shoe you and they fits perfectly. There is joy in Kingdom Dumb and the prince has found his mate, chosen one, and all ends in love and happiness."

        "transcript": "Okay. Well, there was the daddy and the little girl, and her name was Ella. And her apparently they lost the mother, and the daddy remarried and he married a lady with two daughters. And of course, the lady loved her two daughters much more than she did. But when Daddy went away, apparently he traveled in his work some way.At least he went away and left Ella with the stepmother and the two stepsisters. And she made Cinderella do all the work and sleep by the fireplace and sit by the cinders. So they called her Cinderella and she had to wait on the daughters. And in the Disney version, which is the book, the little mice came around and they helped her, and the birds came and helped her with her work. She was very loved by all the animals.And there was to be a ball at the castle where the king and queen were having a ball for the prince to find the bride for the prince. And of course, two stepsisters were going, and Cinderella had to get them ready, and she wanted to go, but the stepmother said no, unless she could manage everything on her own would be the only way she could. So she the little birds and the animals came to her rescue and they helped her make a dress and everything. And so then the fairy godmother came and she fixed her a pumpkin and turned it into a coach. And the rat was the coachman and the mice were the horses.And so the fairy godmother gave her the slippers to wear and told her she had to be she could have a wonderful time at the ball, but she must be home at midnight because everything else would turn back at midnight. And so she went off to the ball and met the prince, and the prince fell in love with her, and all was well. And all of a sudden the clock began to strike and she took off, and she had to run to get away. And she dropped a slipper on the stairs. And the other stepsisters were so disappointed because the prince didn't pay attention to them, only the strange princess that nobody knew.So a day or so later, the prince went from house to house with the slipper, trying to find the girl that could wear it. And some of the stepsisters tried it on, but they couldn't get their foot into it. I think even the stepmother tried to get it on and she couldn't get her foot in it. And so Cinderella asked if she might try it, and they let her. And her little foot slipped right in, and she reached in her pocket and took out the other shoe and put it on.And the prince loved her and married her, and they lived happily ever after."

He's running around, just getting his exercise done, and he accidentally kicks the ball through a window, kicks it through the window and breaks through this guy's house named Matt. And so when John kicks this ball through the window, matt catches it, and it knocks over his lamp and causes some damage. And then Matt either decides, I can do one of two things, I can throw it back and get in trouble, or I can get him in trouble, or I can sit here and maybe help him out and say it's okay, mistakes happen and stuff.So he's looking at him, deciding what to do, and he decides he's just a little kid, so I'm going to give it back to him and just cleans up his mess and fixes the window. Okay, great. Weird. Why? All right, we're going to do the same thing with these pictures.Just kind of look at all of them, and then whenever you're ready, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay.This mom is talking to her son right before he goes off to school. He's just a little boy, and he's walking himself to school, and it's supposed to rain outside, so mom wants to go ahead and give him an umbrella so he can walk and not get wet. But the little kid decides he doesn't want one. He can do it on his own. He can walk there and be just fine.So he decides to go ahead and start walking to school, and then it starts pouring on him. He gets all upset, gets very sad, soaking wet, tries to cover himself up, and then gets back home. And his mom's very upset with him for saying, you should have brought the umbrella. This is what happened. He learns, and then tomorrow when he goes off to school, he decides to bring the umbrella.All right. Excellent. We're going to do the same thing with this picture. It's a little bit different, kind of look at the entire scene, and then whenever you're ready, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, so this cat right here is this little girl's pet, and she's sitting at home with him and accidentally leaves the door open.So the cat gets outside and runs up a tree, and the little girl decides she needs to go try and get her down. So she's sitting there trying to reach for the cat, but can't get her down. And when she goes outside, she still has the door open. So the dog goes out and is trying to get the cat, chase her around, and she still can't get it. So she calls for some help from her neighbor, who tries to get him, but ends up getting stuck in the tree as well and can't get him.So when the dog is still trying to get the cat, the cat won't come down. And the man is now stuck in the tree. The girl calls for fireman to come help that cat get down. And, um, they come and then get the dog and the cat back inside. And then the man gets down."

I probably would handle it different now as an adult, but as a kid it's really traumatic when you don't know what's going on and everything's going round and round and it stopped, it hit a tree or something and my dad was able to unzip and we were right next to the water. Luckily, we never got in the water and he was able to get out and kind of get everybody out and into the car and set up the tent. But then everything was kind of ruined. But we couldn't really leave that night.And there were some biker gang folks who were nearby partying or doing whatever. So my dad sat up all night just to watch everything, and it was just a really bad camping experience. And luckily we kept going, and I had better experiences, so I'm not afraid of camping anymore. But it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid.I'm going to assume, I'll say this takes place in Arizona. And unfortunately, I mean, it was monsoon season and there was a huge storm and caused what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent. And this poor woman decided that, well, she had gone that way home every day, and she really needed to get home to check on her kids. And she was determined to get there, cross the wash that she crosses every day, but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash and didn't make it but a few feet. And the water started surrounding her car and pushing it around and flooding her car.And she couldn't go forward anymore. She couldn't go reverse to get back and started to tumble the car. And she managed to get her window down and get on top of the car and wave to some people that were on the bank to call 911. And rescue crew came out and she was able to well, she got right as they got there, the water got higher and she got swept off the top of her car and was floating downstream. And they were able to shimmy out on a limb and she was able to get close enough to them and they were able to grab her and pull her to safety, and she was okay.Bobby is home from school and he decides to go out and play with his soccer ball. And he's just out on the lawn and practicing his dribling skills and he's bouncing it on his knee and foot and he accidentally kicks it a little too hard and it goes flying right into what do you call that? One of their just, like, bayview windows, a big glass pane window. And crashes in and breaks the window and hits a lamp and knocks it out and breaks the lamp. And Dad's just sitting there inside watching the evening news and he's totally surprised and he grabs."

And there's never any more mention of Cinderella's father, so I'm assuming he's died. And Cinderella's stepmother, her and stepsisters are very mean to her, and they turn her into the maid to do all her work, the household chores and everything. So then the king is throwing a ball, because I presume he wants to find a beautiful, attractive young woman to be his son's wife. The prince and Cinderella's stepsisters were invited because I guess all the young women in the king were invited, and they're just so ecstatic about going to the ball.And Cinderella wants to go, but they say, no, you can't go. And they're busy getting ready.And so her mice friends help make her a dress, and then I think it's pink and white. And then her stepsisters get so jealous when they see her in it that they tear off her jade necklace and destroy her dress. But then Cinderella's fairy godmother comes and makes her a beautiful, pretty white dress.So she goes to the ball, and she's got these nice glass slippers. She goes to the ball, the prince sees her, falls madly in love with her.But then her two stepsisters see her at the ball and she gets scared. So she runs away and she runs off the steps while the prince is calling for her to get back and leaves a glass flipper on the step and runs away. And she comes back. And it seems as though her stepmother has seen her coming back from the ball in her dress and gets mad and locks her in her room. And then the prince comes by with his people to help him or whatever, and they're busy trying to fit the shoe on everyone's feet.But the shoe won't fit on Cinderella's stepsister's feet. It'll only fit on Cinderella's foot. And so the prince has found out that it's truly Cinderella, and they get married and live happily ever after. All right, great. So last asked, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before.As if you've never made one before. Okay.And this.

That was another one that was wonderful.I was successful in my work and I seemed to get along pretty good with the powers to be and managed to make a living and feel like that I was wanted and needed and doing a good job.

And then there's Cinderella.Let's See. Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big, fat, mean cat away from them. And she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives, which is her dream.

I think I was up the first day, actually walking up down the hall, and then I think I was in the hospital five days, went home to my daughters and she made sure I got up at least three times more if she could get me up. We walked up and down the sidewalk out in front and anyway, after about a week, I went home and did very well. I healed fast and it went well.And then they sent me to an oncologist who put me on chemo. He said that it's not good if you have a blood transfusion after surgery. They don't really know why on this kind of surgery. But anyway, he put me on chemo. It was the pill form.And so I took Chemo. I had to go see him every three months and he did a Cat scan, in and blood work every three weeks, which is not too bad, except that iodine really messes your system up that they put into what they call a contrast when they do the Cat scan and the chemo on the pill form. On this particular prescription, the major side effects I didn't want nausea, but it's mouth sores and your palms of your hands and the bottom of your feet blister. So I just told the oncologist I wasn't having any part of that. He didn't want it.He just kind of looked at me, but I didn't have that. And I think there's something called mind over matter and I just decided I wasn't going to deal with it. One of the big side effects of all chemotherapy is fatigue. And another thing, which is I really didn't have that until like the last went to a family reunion in September and kind of wore me out. But then the fatigue hit, and once it hit, it was really bad.And then I have slow arthritis anyway, but I had severe joint pain and muscle ache. But all in all, can't complain about that. It could have been much worse. I just was lucky that they found it.I think the real answer to getting better is all attitude. If you don't have a good attitude, it's going to take you a lot longer."

Okay, here we go.Well, when I was young, I speculate I should know, but I speculate. I was about eight, and my friend and I, back in those days, you could walk the neighborhood. She lived a pretty good ways, but it was still a neighborhood. And she was on her bike, and I was walking behind her. And then she decided it would get us to her house faster if I rode on the back of the seat with her.So I hopped on the seat, and she started pedaling, but my foot, my heel got caught in the spoke of the wheel as the wheel was spinning and almost cut my heel off. So she rode ahead to her house, and I was walking. As she had gone on to her house, I was walking, and all the cars that were passing thought I was crying because she had stolen my bike. So I finally said nobody stopped to help me. But we finally got to her house, and her parents weren't home.So we called my mom, and my grandmother was there too. And they came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. And in the waiting room, a man came up to me to show me that his head had a fishing hook in it and that mine was worse than his. And I should be proud. But I remember this old man with a fishing hook hanging out of his head.So I got stitched up and I was fine. I'd like you to look at all these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Looks like there's a little boy who's just hanging out by himself playing soccer when that ball accidentally goes through the middle of that window while the guy is sitting there watching TV, probably he looks a little shocked, and he takes the soccer ball and keeps it. So again, here is a series of pictures. I'd like you to look at all of them first and then tell me a story at the beginning.Beginning, a middle and an end.I'm going to make this up as I go.

And in that castle, they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a girlfriend for Prince Charming. So they sent out invitations, and Cinderella got one, but her stepsisters wouldn't let her go. They were going to go instead, but Cinderella called on a fairy godmother, and she dressed Cinderella. It's just so beautiful.And mice and the birds all helped. And Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass. And but the fairy godmother says, you better be careful, because at midnight, all this goes away. You go back to being Cinderella, so you have to get everything done by midnight. So, sure enough, she met Prince Charming.And Prince Charming just went head over heels over this lovely Cinderella. And they danced and they danced and they danced, and bang, 12:00 came. And Cinderella had to run and leave because she turned back to whatever she was before, and she was afraid Prince Charming would not like that. So she ran away. And as she was running away, she drops one of her glass slippers and leaves it laying there.But she goes back, and suddenly she becomes Cinderella again.

We'll try you, too. So she goes over there and fits, and everything goes great. Prince Charming is happy, Cinderella's happy, and they live happily ever after."

And the little boy said, I don't want to take an umbrella to school. None of the other kids take their umbrellas to school. And so he finally talked her into, I don't want to take the umbrella. And she finally said, okay, but if it rains, you're going to get wet, so I don't want to hear any complaints.So he makes it about halfway to school, and guess what? It starts raining. And then it starts raining even harder, and he has to run back through the puddles and the rain to his house. And he comes back, and he is absolutely soaked from head to toe. And the mother says, well and he said, I should have listened to you.I should have taken the umbrella. So she dries him off, she gives him the umbrella, and he heads back to school. But this time he's dry all the way to school under the umbrella, even in the rainstorm. Okay, great. Now we have two more short stories.So here's the pictures, and I just want you to again, look at the pictures. They tell a story and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay? So a young boy lived in the neighborhood and loved soccer. And he was constantly kicking a soccer ball around his yard and down on the street and everywhere he went.And one day, he was going down the sidewalk, and he kicked the soccer ball, and it bounced off the side of his foot right through the plate glass window of his neighbor's home. So his neighbor was sitting watching TV at his house, and crash, here comes this soccer ball through the window. He was upset about it, and he picks the ball up, and he looks out the window and sees the boy. And the boy is just very apologetic and says that he'll mow the man's lawn or clean his garage or clean his attic to make up for the cost of the broken window. And so the man said that he would just hold his ball until all that was done and the window was replaced, and they made their deal, and that was that.Okay, great. Okay, now, the last story that I want you to tell me, it's a little bit different. I just want you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. All right. Well, you start by removing two slices of bread from the loaf.Lay them both flat, face down, open. Take a jar of peanut butter. You open that."

And the dog barking at the base of the tree isn't helping anything.And then the father got involved and he said, I can climb up and get the cat for you, buddy.

Well, I've never been really sick. I've never broken a bone, haven't been hospitalized, but I did have breast cancer twice.I have to remember.It was first diagnosed in January, I think that was 94. And the doctor did a lumpectomy outpatient that worked well. And then they tested to see what kind of cancer it is. So they put me on radiation, and first it was chemo, then radiation, and then they gave me follow up tests for different things, but nothing showed up. So they followed me as far as exams went.And three years later I went to the radiologist and in his examination he said, my goodness, I feel a lump. It's just where the other one was. So he was in the same building as a surgeon. So they called up and the surgeon could see me. So he looked at and he said, oh, my goodness.So I guess within three or four days, I had a mastectomy, and that was outpatient. And what they decided to do after that was put me on. It's a drug, they don't use any tamoxifen. So I was on tamoxifen for five years, and I was glad to get off of that. And since then, I have had no signs of cancer.And for a while they thought it was in my lungs and they did lot of testing, but it wasn't. And then they thought, oh, it's in my thyroid. And they had some complicated tests, but it wasn't. And I haven't had any problems since."

        "transcript": "Three years ago, I had been visiting my daughter in Ohio and came back and was feeling kind of sick. And I started to have a familiar feeling, which is because I have IBS. I have occasional IBS attacks that cause me, actually, to faint. So I was trying to get to my medicine, and that usually calms it down. And in the process of doing that, unfortunately, I was standing up, getting trying to find my purse, and passed out right then so that I went down flat bang on the hardwood floor, and apparently I was unconscious.My husband, of course, heard the fall, and I was unconscious enough to scare him, so he called the Ents, and I woke up when they were already there.No, I'm sorry, I didn't actually I woke up before they came, and I was saying, I'm fine, I'm fine. So they convinced me they convinced me that I should probably go to the Er in case it was something more than what I thought it was. And so I did.So I got to the, er and the doctor there, of course, did whatever they do in Far in terms of diagnosing what had happened, and among other things, I had MRI, I think, or Cat scan, I can't remember. And it ended up showing that I had pancreatitis, which was totally undiagnosed and totally after I found out later, talking to a doctor about it had nothing to do whatsoever with my symptoms. So I just accidentally got diagnosed with pancreatitis, spent a couple of days in the hospital. Meantime, my head had a huge lump on it and my hip from falling, and any doctor said one word to me about that, I was so completely kind of out of it that I didn't recognize what was going on. Why did I have these lumps?And finally so anyway, a couple of days later, they told me I could go home from the pancreatitis, and I said, So what the heck is the deal with this? And it turned out, of course, I probably did have a concussion, but it wasn't apparently serious, and so that's good. So anyway, I went home under the instructions not to drink alcohol ever again in my whole life, and I enjoyed wine a great deal, but I absolutely, at that point, stopped drinking entirely and haven't had any real reason to try to. I have a complete an utter, total fear of drinking at this point, actually. Anyway, regardless, I haven't had any other symptoms of pancreatitis, and my head and my hip are fine.So there you go."

I'm under Aunt Charlote's responsibility, and I'm walking to school, and I'm going to end up being sick. So I decided that this was not going to work the way it was.I started to go back home, and I arrived back, I said, Aunt Charlote, do you want to be responsible for my illness and perhaps depth? And she, no, no, I don't want to be sued for that. So she lent me her umbrella, and I walked back to school with Aunt Charlote's umbrella.Thank you very much. That was a very unique take on these pictures. Look at everything that's happening in this picture, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, and I'll say to start, and then I will mute myself so that I don't make any noise to interrupt. Okay? All right, so where's my mute button?Come here. What we're seeing is what happened in my neighborhood about, I would say about a year ago. It was a very peaceful afternoon, and Daisy was playing with her cat, kitty cat. And Kitty Cat decided to climb the tree, and Daisy wanted to bring the cat down, or it wanted to get the cat to come back, but the cat would not go down. So therefore, her dad decided to rescue the cat, and he went up as far as the first branch where you see him sitting down and then was in total distress.In the meantime, our dog, Cooper started to bark at my dad because I'm Daisy's brother. And so Cooper started to bark at dad because Cooper wanted dad to come back. Daisy wanted the cat to come back. Cooper wanted my dad to come back off a tree. And I had the cold mind and criterion because my mother was all up in arms, and she was running like a chicken with its head cut off and not knowing what to do.So they had to rely on me and say, look, this is the situation to call the fire brigade. No one can help us. I'm not going to climb the tree. I'm very bad at climbing trees. I hate the cat.On the other hand, so I'm not going to rescue the cat. And I want Cooper to feel better. I mean, I have a stronger relationship to Cooper than to anybody else in this picture, including the bird. I hate birds and I hate cats, but I like my dad, and I like my sister, sort of, but even though I hate the cat. So I called the fire brigade.And so the fire brigade eventually came and rescued the cat, helped my dad to come back. Cooper was settled down in his dog house, and everything went back to the peace that everything started."

And he had laid around on the couch all day and along about three, maybe put a roast into the pressure cooker to cook for supper. And 330 or so, he came up to tell me that he was beginning to be nauseated. We'd gone to the doctor the day before, and the doctor had started him on blood pressure medicine and an antibiotic. We both had upper respiratory infections, so I just naturally thought maybe the antibiotic was making him sick.I called the doctor's office, but then it was probably four, and they said that his doctor was not in. And I asked if he could see another doctor. The doctor and the office advised us to go to a walk in clinic over at Beaumont. We loaded up and went to the car. He was still nauseated, didn't feel good, knew something was wrong.We got over there, and he was like he's about to vomit. So we took a container over to the walk in clinic, and I registered him, and we sat there maybe 20 minutes. My husband was getting sicker and sicker still. They didn't call us back. So I went up to the counter and asked if there was a doctor in the building.Told him my husband was really sick. Well, maybe five minutes later, they finally got us back to an examining room. The doctor started talking about indigestion. And since my husband has had stomach problems, he knew what indigestion was. He said, no, it isn't indigestion.And the doctor was a foreign doctor. Did not speak English good. And finally she asked him, said, well, what do you think's wrong with you? He said, I'm beginning to think it's my heart. So she ordered an EKG.And they immediately, as soon as that EKG came out, called the ambulance and told me he was having a heart attack and transferred him to Central Baptist Hospital.That was a very trying time."

And what a mysterious thing this was, but it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual period. And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor, and I was sent to the Er for X rays for this lung collapse, and it was never complete. It was only about 15% to 20% of my it was always my right lung.And so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse, and I spent some time trying to figure out, what on earth could this be? And finally I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm. And at the start of each menstrual period, I think it is bleeding, breaking and bleeding into my pleural cavity, because I have found 69 examples of I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation. And the doctor said, well, you might be right.We'll send you to a surgeon. So I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery. I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery, and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had pulmonectomy, and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm, but instead he cemented the top part of my right lung to the cavity that holds it in place so that the next time I would have a bleed into this area, if that's what it was.In fact, my lung would not fall down and create a partial collapse. So that's what happened. After that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened, but I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end, the surgeon said, Well, I guess that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis that bled into the pleural cavity.So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of a type such that I would no longer have menstrual periods. And it all turned out happily ever after. I had no further lung collapses."

And I heard my grandfather say Malcolm, my father's name, JD.Is dead. JD. Was his brother, his only brother, his only sibling and boy. That was the first time I was aware of a death in the family. It really struck me.And as it turned out, it became even more complicated. My uncle had been killed, as we found out later in a plane crash in Mexico there are two volcanoes. One well known Popacata Petal, and then the other, the sleeping maiden, which the warrior Popokata Petal guards. It took more than two weeks for the climbing party to get up to determine if anyone had survived. None had not survived, unfortunately.But I remember with being with my father various situation, waiting to find out about this, eventually found out. It was very hard. My father, he and his brother were very, very close. They only separated by eleven months in age. And my father mother had to go down to Mexico and bring my aunt and my cousins back.And in those days you went by train and getting across the border and coming back was not easy. The war was still on and the wartime, which you probably can't appreciate what it was like back then, but moving across borders was really tricky and they did bring them all back. I remember it distinctly. The family buries in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I can still see the large dark wood coffin which was set in my grandparents house and living room, which was pestimentary in those days, unopened because my uncle, of course, had to be cremated, put in a little silver art which to put in the concert.My mother grandmother, being a good Methodist, believed that everybody get buried in a coffin, not little silver caskets. And that was the first death I experienced as a child. And it had a varied, marked effect on me. I remember it all very clearly.

        "transcript": "I've been many friends at our church helped in the ceremony, and it was just an absolutely memorable, marvelous day. The young man is practicing with his soccer ball, and he gives it a good boot, and bang, it goes through the window of a house, and it sharply awakens a fellow sitting in a chair where the glass breaks and the ball comes through. And the last frame shows the fellow looking out the break in the window, holding the ball and wondering what the heck happened and who can he blame for it?Okay, here a mother is offering her child, I guess a little boy, an umbrella. And the little boy is saying, no, I don't need that. I'll just go out the front door and be fine. Well, the mother keeps the umbrella. The little boy goes outside, and it begins to rain.And now it's raining harder and blowing a little. So he goes back inside, very soaked. His mother looks at him like she's not real happy with him. But the last frame shows him walking with the umbrella and keeping the rain off.Okay, we have a picture of raging water, which indicates that probably the beginning of the story was a flash floodstorm flood, a rainstorm of some type, and a young lady appears to have been trapped in the raging waters. And someone of an emergency nature fireman or someone officially has a vest on has come to rescue her. She is hanging on the branch, and he has wrapped a belt around her to keep her safe and will affect the rescue.Cinderella had two sisters or two stepsisters or anyway, two girls who didn't like her. They were jealous of her. The evil girl's mother didn't like her either. And there was going to be a ball. And the sisters could go, but Cinderella could not.And then out of nowhere came a fairy godmother who gave her a beautiful dress. And lo and behold, she got to go to the ball. And her dog, as I recall, was very happy about it. But then at the ball, there is a handsome prince, and they dance. And all of a sudden, she is by herself, or she's sitting on a pumpkin in a tree, I know not why, with one glass slipper.And then the mice help her find her way back home, I think. And all of a sudden, the prince shows up, and he has the other glass slipper, and they live happily ever after."

Then It Gets harder and It Starts Raining more. And It Starts Raining more he goes back home. He is soaking wet. She is upset with him and he's got a down looked face.And then it ends with him walking back, I guess, towards school with an umbrella. Okay.

He could be in the ambulance system, has a life jacket on, has jumped into a swirling sort of a creek trying to pull out a little girl who is hanging on to this limb and getting and saving the little girl from the raging waters of this swelled creek due to the rains that have come.This is a story of a little girl, little orphan girl who comes from a very poor family. Her name is Cinderella and she is sent off to another home with a woman and two daughters who are not very welcoming at all. In fact, the daughters are quite jealous and the woman is quite almost mean.They make a servant out of Cinderella. She waits on the daughters and the mother hand and foot, cleaning, picking up after them, trying to take care of the cat, which has little horns on it, and the cat doesn't like it at all. Well, Cinderella, there's the big fall, annual fall coming up at the castle, and the king has raised holy cane with his son about finding a wife, and he decides to throw this ball to get him introduced to the young ladies or the young ladies in the community introduced to him that he might be able to find a wife. Well, she looks out across the rooftops to the castle, and she wishes she could go, but she can't. She's Poor.The mother and the daughter's jealous of her. They don't want her to do anything. All they're interested is in their own well being and how they're going to look and how they're going to dress and what they're going to put on and this and that. And they squabble and bicker and fight among themselves. And in the meantime, Cinderella looks at the one of the gowns that the girls are going to bang.Well, there's about four mice that enter the picture about this time who are friends of Cinderella and realize her predicament. And by golly, they go to the fairy godmother and they take Cinderella."

        "transcript": "And who did you eat lunch with? Or where did you walk after school with so and so or what you talk about? And usually I just get shut down. And I think that probably I keep doing it. I keep asking the questions because I feel like the very little bit of communication she gives me or feedback, I'll take it.But that's not to say I don't use strategy. Sometimes what I do is probably not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive aggressive with her. And it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't want to know anything, and I'm like, fine, or I just walk away usually a little bit later, she will know that she somehow impacted. I think she knows she has hurt me in some way, that she knows she's now withholding the information and that my walking away is because she knows I want more and because I care. It's like we have to go through a dance, it's like this dance, to get a little bit more information.Thought I'd do it because anything I can get, I'll take. Thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. It can be happy or sad. It could be from any time, childhood to now, just anything that sticks out to you as being an important event. And whenever you're ready, you may begin.Okay?This wasn't a single time. It was, I would say, every Sunday, just about every Sunday. There were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday, and it was the highlight of my week. My grandparents, my mom's parents were just everything that I wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple and his willingness to be chivalrous. But my grandma had her own mind.It's like he, at that time, was able to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play. But he did it. So it was really important for me because I just had my mom at home to see this really healthy dynamic between two people, and everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there.My grandpa would have he always had a handful of nuts because there was a squirrel named Petey who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now, I'm sure it wasn't just one Petey. There were probably 20 Peteies, but I thought it was Petey, and I just always called Petey. And so we would feed Petey, and then we would go inside, and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of dinner. Late afternoon ish dinner.And it was always fancy, like high noon kind of dinner. And everything was always homemade and wonderful. And she laid out the table so beautifully, and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that. We would have our nice lunch, and we would all clean up.And then my grandpa would pull carrots out of the refrigerator and we would walk to this little horse stable area right near their house."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a family, and there was a mother and a father and a daughter. And the mother died, and the father went out, and he found another wife, and he brought his new wife in. But she had two daughters. And Cinderella, who had been the joy of her mother and father, was relegated to the Cinderellas, and she had to do all the chores for her two stepsisters. And her stepmother didn't think much of her either, so she just had a terrible time.And then there was in this kingdom where Cinderella lived, there was a king, and he decided that it was time for his son to get married. So he sent out an edict that all the eligible young attracted women in the kingdom would come for a ball. They would have a ball on a certain night. And so the invitations went out to all in Sundry. And it came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters.And they were all eligible, but her two stepsisters were not very pretty. But they got really excited, and they got oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes and marvelous this, marvelous that. And Cinderella got excited, too, and she thought it would be just great. But she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball, and she would have to help her sisters get ready. And so the night came, and they got themselves ready, and they went off in a carriage, and they were looking down their nose at her, and she was ready to cry.And all of a sudden, a fairy godmother showed up and touched her with a wand, and she turned into this beautiful dress. And then there was a pumpkin, and she turned that into a coach. And then there were some mice, and she turned that into the horses. And she made this beautiful thing for this Cinderella who wasn't going to get to go to the ball. And she had all these lovely little glass slippers.But she said the one thing, you cannot stay out after midnight. So when the clock starts to strike, you've got to leave. You've got to go before the clock starts to strike. So she went to the ball, and when she got there, the prince saw her and he took one look, and he just fell in love. And so he found her, and everybody else just had to stand back and wait, because that's all he could do, was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found.And they danced, and they danced all over the place, and everybody else was sort of put to the side. But you know what? She forgot that she had to leave at midnight. So the clock started to strike, and she remembered. So she started flying down the steps to leave, but she lost a slipper, and she flew out the door.And by this time her carriage had turned into a pumpkin and her horsemen had turned into mice. But she finally got home. I've forgotten exactly how, but she got home. And there she was again in the Cinderellas by the fireplace. And the other two daughters came home.And of course they had the story to tell. But a lot came him an envoy from the kingdom. And he said, we're trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper. And of course the stepmother said, oh, we go back to the kitchen, to the centers. We can't foo with."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ella. She was the daughter of two loving parents. Only one day, when she's a little girl, her mother dies suddenly. It's very tragic. Everybody cries.Everybody loves her mother. Her father, in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom, goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women, unfortunately, are spiteful, jealous creatures. He brings them all home to his lovely manor, where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father, partly out of heartbreak and partly out of just a really bad diet, also dies. At this point, the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy.They make her run around working all the time, and they begin mocking her for being dirty, and they call her Cinderella. Now, their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day when the prince, who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining land, decides he will marry one of his own people, or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball, and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this. They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns.Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go, too, just to get out of the house, have a bit of glamour. But of course, they won't let her, because they tell her that she would be an embarrassment. But mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball, and Cinderella is left alone, sort of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house. And she begins crying.She's crying and crying by the fireplace, when all of a sudden, a woman materializes from the flames and says, cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says, I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, oh, well, I am your fairy godmother and is within my power to grant this. So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs?And you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers, and so that will do. And she waves her wand, and the pumpkin turns into a carriage, and her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ball gown, and her slippers into slippers of cut glass, none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen. And Cinderella is just overcome with joy, and she gets into the carriage, and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairy godmother says, unfortunately, my magic power is limited. And at midnight, when the chimes go, everything will turn back.So make sure that you are well away from the ball and out of an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens. Cinderella says, I will. I will. And she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball and she arrives, and it's even more dazzling than she thought. And she comes in, and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming.And in the midst of her being greeted by throngs of enchanted admirers, the prince looks up and he sees her, and he asks her to dance. And they begin to dance. And of course, they're both super hot, so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together. And the prince is about to propose to her there and then on the spot, and the clock begins to strike twelve and she says, oh, no. Oh, I need to go.And she runs."

        "transcript": "So I may as well do something right now to help make up for that. And so she cleans the place with all the help of the woodland creatures who like the way she sings, like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know, I think Thumper shows up. So she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling. And then she yawns and falls all across the beds.There are seven of them and she just falls all across them. And it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there. And about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work. Hi ho, hi ho.They work in the mines. There is Doc Happy, Grumpy, Dopey, Bashful, sneezy.They can do this.Happy doc grumpy dopey sneezy. Sleepy, Sleepy, sleepy is the 7th, okay? So there are those seven dwarves and they work in the mines gathering precious gems and whatnot. And they come a marching home because of course it's their home. There are seven little beds for seven little dwarves.And they enter their home and they see this strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up. And she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that.So she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent looking, the dwarves are all like, yeah, okay, I believe you. You can stay with us as long as you're in danger. As long as you keep cleaning up the place and make our food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she's cool with that. And so she lives with them happily for some time.And then the Evil Queen has been sitting smug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day she saunters up to the magic mirror and she says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still, still Snow White, still. You didn't kill her. And the Evil Queen flies into a rage and she decides if you're going to do something right, do it yourself.She probably kills the huntsman. She probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. So she goes down to her lair where she makes all her potions because as an evil Queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion that she dips a white apple into and pulls it out.And it is red as blood. And it is of course, a poison apple because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples. Hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking.I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been genetically modified. But then she disguises herself as this old crone and she marches off into the forest. I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the dwarves are off to work.And Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her animal friends, probably. And Snow White answers the door and says, oh, look, an old crone with a magically delicious looking apple. I'm probably completely safe. The old crone says, Would you like an apple, child? And she says, Yep, still safe.And she takes the apple and the crone says, yes, child, eat the apple."

Take a look at all of them, and then I'm going to ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay? And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story.It all right. So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella, and he didn't want to take it because he didn't believe it rain. So right as he started walking outside, it started raining, and he gets mad and is stomping through the puddles, wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house wet and gets umbrella, then continues on his journey. Okay, great.So here's another picture. I want you to look at everything that's happening, and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right, so this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree. Her father thought he could rescue the cat, so he brought a ladder, placed it on the branch, and climbed up.And then his ladder fell, so he stuck up in the tree with a cat, and for some reason, the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out. So they had to call the fire department, and the fire department came, and the fire department's on their way to rescue them, to rescue the cat and the father.Great. Thank you. Okay, so now I'm going to have you this is, again, another story. Have you ever heard of Snow White? I've heard of it.Okay, that's fine. Take a time to look at the pictures. Tell a story. I want you sorry.The pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm going to take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures, okay? And then ask you to tell me the story in your own words, all right? Okay, so now just tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can, and you can use any details that, you know, prior or what you just looked at. So just what I looked at.So there was this queen who was hoping she'd be the fairest lady of the land, all right? And so she'd asked her magic mirror, which had a face in it, and she'd ask, who's the fairest lady of them all? And usually the mirror would reply, she is. But one day the mirror replied, snow White is. So the queen was upset and banished Snow White.And then Snow White was going through the forest us, and she found seven dwarfs, and for some reason she fell asleep, but they thought she was gone."

        "transcript": "Okay, so Cinderella, once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella or Ella. And then I think they added the cinder because she was dirty or something because she had to clean. Anyway, so there's this girl, and she had a family, and her father was little, well off, and then her mother ended up dying. And so her father remarried a woman, the evil stepmother, who had two daughters, anastasia and maybe I don't know. I remember they had, like, longer kind of mouthful names, so they ended up moving in.And the two sisters bickered a lot, and the stepmom didn't like Cinderella. And then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil stepsisters. And this is so weird to tell it. And so then the evil stepmother was like, you're just going to be amazed in the house because she didn't really like her.So she exiled her to a room in the attic, and it made her pretty much a servant. And one day, the prince, prince Charming, announced that he was having a ball, I think in order to look for a wife or something like that. And the stepsisters or the stepmother really wanted the stepsisters to go, and the stepsisters wanted to go, too, because they wanted to go meet the prince and have their shot at him to see if they could marry him. And Cinderella was like, oh, cool. Maybe I'll go.And the stepmother was like, yeah, no. And so I think Cinderella has her animal accomplices. I know one. The mice name is Gus Gus. I don't remember the other one.And her animal and the birds and stuff, the singing birds. And they make a dress for her. She's, like, looking through I think it was her mom's stuff. So she gets an old dress of her mom's, and then they make it all pretty and stuff for her. And so she's getting ready to go to the ball, and she walks downstairs to go out, and the sisters and the stepmother rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry because they don't want her going.And I think maybe they locked her a room or something. I don't know how she ends up getting out. But anyway, she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the bar, getting ready to go. And then fairy godmother appears. Okay, she doesn't try to sneak out.The fairy godmother appears first. And then it was like, oh, let's turn you into a beautiful princess. And then she turns her gown into this beautiful ball gown. She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods.And the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into a carriage, and, like, her animal friends turn into horses. And so then she goes to the ball. She makes this late grand entrance, and the prince is very fascinated with her, and so they have a dance. But one of the of this magic from the fairy godmother was that it expires at midnight. So she's dancing with him, and the clock strikes, symbolize that the time, or like midnight is coming, and she's."

        "transcript": "Cinderella lived in a house with her two sisters and her evil grandmother. And poor Cinderella, because she was the baby of the family, always got stuck with doing all the chores. And that didn't matter if she was out tending the animals out in the barn or feeding the dog or slopping the hogs, even having to cook all the meals. And her two older sisters, they just had to run in a house. They just got to go to all the parties and play around the way they wanted to do.And no matter what Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, the grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters.Well, every year they have this large dance in town and it's to celebrate, I guess, the harvest and all of that type stuff. So they have this big party and everybody gets dressed up. There's all kind of food and dancing and so forth. And Cinderella has never been able to go. I mean, she's just always shunder because she's just the dog, sort of as far as the evil grandmother knows.So the two sisters come along and they get all dressed up and they're off to the party. Well, they're having such a wonderful time. Poor Cinderella's at home and she sort of beside herself. But all of a sudden a fairy godmother appears to her and says, cinderella, why are you sitting at home? Says, well, I don't have a dress and I have no preparations.My grandmother hates me, my sisters hate me, and I'm never allowed to go anywhere. So the fairy godmother says, well, we're going to fix that today and I'm going to get you a new gown, and in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown and gets all these fancy shoes. And I think her feet were made out of like glass slippers. They were probably like a rock crystal.So she gets transported to the dance and man, her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, with the king and the queen and the prince being there, the prince just is really impressed with this Cinderella chain.So they dance and they dance and they dance and they dance. And the day seems to go by so quickly. But all of a sudden, Cinderella hears the clock ringing and the bells start chiming. And she remembers that her fairy godmother said that, boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight or else you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person and all of this stuff is going to be washed away and everybody will know that it's just like a boy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from and in the process loses one of her shoes.But she does manage to get home and her fairy godmother collects up all her garb and everything."

        "transcript": "And the mice, the brave little mice who have been turned into horses and chased by cats and made her a dress that got ripped to shreds, still somehow find it within their little mousey hearts to go down and steal the key to the room Cinderella is locked in from the evil stepmother, and they bring it up to her after much trial and error. And Cinderella. Unlocks the door. She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsisters feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass swept up.And everyone panics because the stepsisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the Prince is dancing with. Obviously, that's the only reason they can't prove that. And the advisor is panicking because King wants the Prince to get married. The Prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe, and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says, but wait, I have the other slipper.And lo and behold, she does in fact have the other slipper, which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why. Fairy Godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes and she shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper. And then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot.I don't think she should be able to stand in real life and puts it on her. And it fits beautifully, of course. And so there was triumphant music, and they all lived happily ever after. The princess? No, Cinderella.She wasn't a princess yet. Had to get the ring first. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind and married the Prince. Probably still doesn't know her name. The end.The end. All right. That's awesome. Is that too long? No, that's great.Okay, so now I'm going to have you do the same type thing. Oh, excellent. But for Snow White. Okay, so again, we've covered up all of the type, so just look through the pictures. Less comprehensive knowledge of Snow White.So this will probably be shorter. That's fine.She's very melodramatic. Look at this. Look at this. What is this face? I mean, I get that she's panicked, but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances.It all right, Tim. So Snowy and the Seven Dwarves just told for somebody who vaguely remembers that. Okay, so now I'm not sure if Snow White was actually a princess or something before the Evil Queen usurped her throne, or if, like, she's the beautiful cousin or something, and we're just waiting for the Evil Queen to die off before Snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there's this evil queen. She's got the high, regal cheekbone.She could probably be nice looking if she wasn't so evil. So I don't know what she's so insecure about, but Snow White is the fairest in all the land."

But the other two were spoiled brats because they didn't have anything to do with her and they thought they were something special. And them, whenever she would come in with some tea or coffee no tea because it was in a pot, some tea she would bring it to them and they would make fun of her because she was not dressed like they were. And then they didn't even want it because they didn't feel like having it then.So they complain. And she liked according to the pictures that I sort of remember, she liked little animals. She liked the mice, she liked the horse, she liked the dog, the cat. And she found peace with them. She got along with them.And finally, there was one time that someone brought her address. A man was relative, I guess, and she tried it on. She looked very pretty. And the sisters were jealous. They didn't want her to have that dress.She looked lovely, but they didn't want to admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, I have to watch you. So that was that. But then they took the dress away. And then by and by, they hear that they're going to have a big ball at this palace and they got some kind of written notice on it.And so the mother says to the three of them, heard it together, the little girl that was mistreated. And the two stepsisters, they all heard. They're all very happy. And so she says, okay, we're going to get you dressed up in the most beautiful dresses and make sure that you get the prize because I understand that he's looking for a woman. So the mother gets the two stepdaughters dressed up as best she could.In the meantime, Cinderella went up to the attic and she looks through some of the things that were there and she finds a little book with a picture and a dress, a beautiful dress. And she says, that's nice. Now, the four mice are there and they can hear her. She says, that would be nice. I would like to have that dress.And they make it for her. They make it for her. So she puts it on. She looks beautiful. She has beads.She has a sash, and she has that's what they showed. And then when the time came that they were to go, she came down because they were dressed up. So she was dressed up now in this dress. And they looked at her, and she did look beautiful in it. But they tore the beads off, tore the sash off, took off her dress, says, you're not going to that party, only we because we look better and we'll win.And the mother is going right along with everything. So she says, you go to your room and take care of what you have to and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time, exc. So she goes back in her room and she's very sad. And her fairy godmother comes along and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? She says, Because I wanted to go to the party."

And they quickly moved into Cinderella's house and overtook the house. And I do forget what happened to the dad. But he went off and it was just Cinderella.The two stepsisters and the stepmother and the stepmother and the stepsisters used Cinderella as a maid. And they renamed her to Cinderella because of Cinders and all the cleaning. And she was dirty. And they told her how she wasn't pretty and she was really, truly much prettier than her mean, evil stepsisters. And what would you call it?The Town. The region decides the prince is going to have a ball. And the two sisters come home and their mom and they're very excited because there's going to be a ball. And all the young women of the lands are invited. And the two sisters start planning their outfits and the mother's involved in it.And all assuming that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty and the prince would never want to see her. So the night comes, and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful. And off they go to the ball. And I think the mother may have gone as well. And she's left at home.And she's sitting out in the garden and her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother has a chitchat with her and finds out she really does want to go. So the Fairy Godmother uses her wonderful magic wand and then uses the help of the tiny little mice. And the mice are poof become the I don't know what you call it. The chariot attendant. So the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful and addressed.Her hair is all done up. She's absolutely exquisite. She takes a pumpkin. The pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot. The mice become the chariot.People, they open the doors. They drive her off to the ball. She has a lovely night up. Almost Forgot. As she gets into the pumpkin chariot, which is now beautiful.The fairy godmother says, have a great time, but you must be home by midnight because all this is going to disappear. The magic at midnight. So she goes off. She goes to the ball and the prince is dancing with everybody. And of course, he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room.He asks her to dance. They have many lovely dances. And then all of a sudden, she tunes into what time it is somehow. And she says I must says no, no. And she's like, no, I really must go.She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight. She's running down the steps of the palace. She just gets into her pumpkin chariot. She leaves. As she's running, she leaves a sandal step.What you call it? A beautiful pump on the steps. As she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin. She manages to get home in time before the stepsisters and they come home and say, what a wonderful time. They kind of tease her for being stuck at home and ask her what she did and they dream about what a wonderful time.And then everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind. And he is going throughout the lands to find who spoot fits this slipper. And it's a very delicate glass slipper. And so eventually they get to Cinderella's home. The two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it.Of course it doesn't fit. Cinderella wants to try it. They think it's ridiculous because she wasn't really supposed to be there."

The sister always crying, my poor little kitty, what should I do? She calls for her father to climb the tree to help get the kitty.And the dog is barking because he's worried about the father. I don't know if he's worried about the cat. And they're all worried that their kitty is not going to be saved until someone called the fire department who came to their rescue. And I hope everything is going to be fine. They would get the kitty down and the father would have to jump down and little darling daughter will be happy and be able to ride her bicycle.How come the father didn't use the ladder to get the kitty down himself instead of climbing up the tree?We'll see if the kitty is going to be saved and thank the fire department for what they have done. It happened there last in October of nine and September of eight. I was sitting in the house. The exact same things happened both times. I was taking a nap and I got up about near 05:00 and all of a sudden I went to the bathroom to urinate and I was urinating blood.And it was the scariest moment in my life. And I just got over there and I called up my son, please come over. I didn't tell him what it was and he lives about a block away and he came over and he saw me bleeding and I thought he was going to drop dead. I wrapped myself in a towel and I said, drive me to the hospital. And I went there and I went to the emergency room and it stopped bleeding.I strained my bladder or something and I had internal bleedings. And I was so happy that all it was, was an internal bleeding. They just gave me some antibiotics and they kept me in the hospital overnight. And all the tests were negative and it just was internal bleeding. And they say I strained myself moving my bowels and I was happy at the result, but I wasn't happy when I saw the blood coming out.It happened in 208 and exactly one year later, later, the exact same thing happened again. And I just said, oh, I just was cursing myself, what is happening over there? And I was talking to the doctors and I was playing."

And so she steps out on her journey, is enjoying her walk through the woods, reversing with all the woodland creatures, come up upon a wolf who is less than friendly. Big Bad Wolf that they have a conversation, he's intimidating and eventually he leaves her alone. She continues on her journey as she is continuing to her grandmother's house. The wolf makes it to her grandmother's house, scares her grandmother out and hides in the grandmother's bed posing as the grandmother for when Red gets there.And then as they go, the Red Riding Head comes up, is talking back and forth with the wolf posing as her grandmother and is gradually realizing that things aren't quite right. My grandma, what big teeth you have. I don't remember what all the different body parts are but things are not looking quite right for this to be Grandma. And she eventually realizes that it's the wolf runs out of the house. The wolf goes chasing after her and is apparently eventually saved by some sort of woodsman because she finds her grandma by a tree and then there's a guy with an axe and so that's cool.Yeah. Apparently there are like 15 different ways that Little Red Riding Hood can end up to it, including her getting eaten by the wolf. Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess I forgot to say that. But honestly, if you know a story that's not the same as the pictures, use the pictures or whatever but tell the story that you know the next one is no life.This one I can manage pretty well. Yeah. This one's not quite as well loved. No, not quite.So Snow White is similar to Cinderella in that there's an evil matriarch.So Snow White is just minding her own business in the kingdom where she lives. Of course, the Evil Queen is not happy with her because when the Evil Queen wants to inquire as to who is the fairest in the land, the answer is Snow White and not herself. That makes her not happy. So eventually she banishes Snow White out of the kingdom. Scares her off, however.Exactly. And so Snow White goes running into the woods, finds a little house that looks quite hospitable and so she goes in, just makes herself at home, doesn't really find anybody, but that's cool. Eventually the seven dwarves come home and are wondering what this woman doing in their bed is, how she got here? Why is she here? And and so eventually they sort of make a happy little life together and are."

        "transcript": "Okay, then you may tell me your story.In April 2016, I went to see Mumford and Sons, and I stayed in Indianapolis at the Alexander Hotel with a friend. And when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, I remember feeling a lump under my left armpit, my left side, and it was in a really funny location, so I was sort of surprised that I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram, and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound, and I took my friend Dorothy with me. And the oncologist who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with stage two cancer. So I called my sister, who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff, but she lives in Chicago, so she wasn't going to let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington.So I went to Chicago, to Northwestern, for what seemed like that entire summer, may, June, July. It takes many months to compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer. And especially the first time, they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they choose the best course of treatment. Especially because I was 40, they view that as young, and so it's pretty radical. So anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months and months of agony, and then ultimately have I have a bilateral lumpectomy, so they found it in both sides, actually, after all the tests, and that was removed, my surgeon at Northwestern was great, very comforting and confident, which is what I needed.And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery. The medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation. And then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. So after I had my surgery, a week later, they put my port in.And the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to where they administer the drugs for chemo. And I had treatment every other week for a couple of months. And I recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful. And you can taste them, you can smell them, but in your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells, they are doing what they're supposed to be doing.So all of that said that's I guess, how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing, being killed. After my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation, and that just made me tired, so that was okay. And then that was right. I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6. My radiation ended just after Christmas.So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments. And that's what happened."

And you can't expect the whole world to accommodate you in a small group, maybe in a large group, and by the time you get out what you want to say the conversation is miles down the road. I don't know what the answer is. He always spoke too much to be able to use devices. When Palm Pilots were first used in speech therapy in the late 90s, early 2000, medicare would not pay for them unless they had none of the additions that made Palm Pilots so wonderful and useful.It couldn't have a calendar and it couldn't have games and it couldn't have a calculator. All the functions medicare said they would pay for them if all they did was helpless speech. And we ended up with Palm Pilots around the house anyway. But he had too much verbal speech by then to use a device. So for some people who had no speech, it was awesome.And I think it still is to this day. I think for people like him, it slows everything down too much. So he just plugs along everything I can think of. Right. That's wonderful.Yeah. Now, thinking back, I'd like you to tell me about a story about something important that has happened to you in your life. It could be happy or sad from any time.It's going to take a minute. Take your time. And I'll mute myself when you're speaking to not let any sound interfere. Sure. I hate it when my mind just goes blank when I'm trying to think of something like this, something important in my life.Well, I think for any woman, I think probably the most important thing if you are fortunate enough to have that experience is having children. And it's interesting moments that stick out in your life. Never forget. You can remember all the details. And I remember when my first son was born and it was a very long affair, 22 hours.But what I remember not so much about the 22 hours and how tired I was, but I remember so clearly the delivery room. This delivery room is on the campus of IUPUI and it is now a health center for students. And I don't mean I'm not really sure exactly, I don't think there are rooms that they stay in or that sort of thing, but I think clinics type thing. But this is an old post war building and I believe it's two or three stories high and it was a women's hospital at the time I had my first two children. And the most amazing thing about this room is that there were windows and a door.It was on the second floor and it's still there. If you go to the Riley garage you can see it. There's a stairway down, a wooden stairway, no, west down to the ground level. And I remember the day that this wonderful thing happened. I remember the door was open."

He kicked it so hard, boom. It went right through his neighbor's window.And when it went through the window, it went right into the neighbor's living room, knocked over a lamp close to where man was sitting. It startled the man. The man picked up the ball and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from. Okay. There was once a girl called Cinderella.She didn't have any parents, and she lived in an orphanage.But she lived in an orphanage. And the orphanage was looking for a family to take her.So they put out a notice. A mother that had two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see Cinderella, to take her in. They saw Cinderella. The orphanage director introduced Cinderella. Cinderella did a courtsey, said, Pleasure to meet you.And they took Cinderella away. Once they got Cinderella home, cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean, and so were the stepsisters. All they made her do was chores. All day long, nothing but work, work, work. Cinderella, do this.Cinderella, do that. Cinderella, get my food. Cinderella, do the laundry. Cinderella, feed the animals, the cats, the dog, the horses. All Cinderella could do was just work, work, work all the time.Later that evening, an invitation came to the house from the king, inviting all the girls, all the unmarried ladies, to the princess ball so that perhaps a prince could find somebody to marry.And so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball, and so was Cinderella. She thought she would be going, too. Cinderella went into a bed while she was cleaning. She went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress. And so she went ahead and tried the dress on.However, when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her with the dress and also the jewelry she was wearing, she says, what are you doing? What are you doing? Cinderella says, well, we've all been invited to the ball. Cinderella and the evil stepsisters. And the stepmother saying, you're not going.You're ugly. You're staying here. Nobody's going to want to marry you. And they snatch the jewelry off of her, and they snatch the dress off of her and says, you're not going anywhere. We're going to the ball, and one of us will marry the prince, but you've got to stay home, because nobody wants to marry you anyway.And so off to the ball they went. Cinderella stayed at home, and she was crying. And before you knew it, she was crying so hard. All of a sudden, she started hearing bells, and there's twinkling all around. And a fairy godmother appeared.And Cinderella says who are you? I'm your fairy godmother, and I'm here to grant you a wish to go to the ball. And Cinderella says, well, I can't go because I don't have a dress and I don't have a way to get there. So the fairy Godmother waved her magic wand and created a dress for her. She says, oh, the dress is beautiful, but I don't have any shoes.She waved her magic wand again, and there were some glass slippers for her. So she put on the glass slippers, and now she was truly a beautiful, beautiful young lady."

And we fell off the roof at the same time. Anyway, we slid off the roof and he landed on my ankle, and my ankle was like turned completely like this, and it's supposed to be like that, so it was crushed. He landed on it. Anyway, I remember looking at my ankle and I just went like that.So we went to the emergency room and the doctor, they called in an orthopedic person and he said I'd never walk again and that my ankle was crushed into many pieces. And he told me that there was no need for plates and steel stuff to open it up. He was just going to anesthetize me and put it back together like clay because they were all little pieces. So anyway, they gave me IV morphine and he put my squished my ankle back together. I was in a cast for three months up to my hip.And it was a hard time because I couldn't move for three months. And we lived in a cabin in Fairbanks without running water and without a bathroom. We had an outhouse. So if you're not the adventurous type, that will sound really disgusting. But like I said, I was young and I went to Alaska and thought it would be really fun to live in a cabin.We had electricity, no internet then, I don't think. There wasn't anything such thing as internet anyway, so my husband took really good care of me. But I remember certain things. One was the morphine for a good day. I felt incredible love and peace, and I knew it was the morning.I'd never felt that much love or peace in my life.It was really weird. But what helped me, I think I was just determined that I would walk again. I couldn't believe that. I never believed the doctor. I just thought that was a bunch of fooey, really, because I thought in this day and age, this is just a stupid bone.And I just never believed them. And I think they protect themselves legally. I believe that firmly. And I slowly got better.I was stubborn then and I didn't do anything. The doctor told me, and I regret that. I didn't go to physical therapy. I didn't do any of that."

They go across country and all of a sudden they hit very deep, rough, rocky road and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out, still clutching its pink dog and all of a sudden looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into the horizon where it's watching it disappear. The mouse family arrives at a lovely big glen with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic. So they aisle pile out. They picnic basket the tables, various and sundry items that they need for the picnic.They spread the table down. They're beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock. They're dancing, they're playing. They have musical instruments.Either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane. They have a big basket of food. They have a thermos jug with a beverage of Miss BI's tea. The little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse and they're all having an absolutely wonderful time. The next scene they're playing the instrument.The mother and the father are sitting on the edge of the picnic cloth on the ground. All the beautiful picnic is all laid out. Mother and the grandparents are up on the side of a small hill playing music. The kids are playing baseball. Somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook.And then we flash back to the baby who got bounced out of the truck who has still got his ladybug by his side and his doll, his pink doll. He looks all around, doesn't see much. Doll is upside down but he's still hanging on to him. All of a sudden spots a whole bush full of red berries or flowers I would assume maybe berries because the flowers on the page look like flowers. Back to the picnic.Everybody is having a wonderful time. The picnic baskets have now been open. They're taking pictures of one another. One of the baby mice is jumping off of the dock into the water. Two or three of them are playing in the water.Somebody is sailing a boat. The baseball plug is now lying on the ground. Mother is pouring milk. One of the babies is in the salad.

I don't know if she lives there or if she just lives in the town or what. But she's mad at her and she wants her to go away. So Snow White knows that she has to run away, I guess, or hide or something.But anyway, there's this guy who's kind of like lumberjacky, sort of. And he shows up to the queen because he needs money. And he said, yeah, I'll go kill her. And so he goes and he finds her. But then when he gets there, she's like really super nice and he feels bad and so he doesn't kill her, but he's like, hey, this lady, she's really trying to take you out, so you've got to get out of here.So she runs in the forest and stuff. Oh, yeah, before all this, she wants to marry the prince. But I don't know how she met the prince. So I don't know whether she saw a picture of him or whatever, but she likes this prince, and maybe the old lady is like a cougar and she likes the prince too. Maybe the prince is her son and she doesn't think that Snow White is good enough.I have no idea. But there is a prince, and she likes this prince or she dreams about it or whatever. So anyway, back to the lumberjack. He tells her to get out of here and she runs off in the woods. And the woods are really scary and stuff.And she runs for a long time and then it's sort of like three bears where she comes in this house and she's like, oh, I'm really tired. And she probably tries all these beds. But anyway, we only see her in one of the beds in the picture and she is sleeping. Well, while she's sleeping, the people that own the house come in and they are seven weird little dwarfy men. And apparently she does not think this is creepy.She thinks this is okay. And she becomes friends with them and they are pumped to have her staying with them, which obviously they would. She's the fairest in the land, so I don't know what she does there. Maybe she cleans. I know that they also whistle while they work and I think that they work in a coal mine or something like that.And actually, I hope this doesn't this is an aside here to this story. When I was little, I had this record that my parents put on for me all the time. And they used to laugh because I'd stand in my crib and I would sing the Dig, Dig song. But it was just me going, dig the crib thing. And so I felt I made the mistake of telling Adam.And so every once in a while when I'm working, he's like, dig, dig, dig, dick, dig dick, dick. I'm like, oh, God. So anyway, I know that they dig from the record, but I don't really know what they dig. But they whistle when they go and they whistle when they come back. So something happens.Oh, that really mean witch lady makes herself like even more ugly. Mean witch. And she comes up to Snow White and I guess she's like, I don't know, like roaming farmers market lady or something like that. She's like, I have apples. And so I thought, yay, because she's going to make like apple pie or something for the little dwarf men.And so she gets apples and she eats them and then she passes it out."

And when he died, the stepmother turned Cinderella into kind of a housemaid and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life, while Cinderella scrubbed the floors, cleaned the fireplace.But Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life, and she became friends with all the animals in the house, except Lucifer. He was a mean old cat. It was a stepmother's cat, but she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends. And she lived upstairs in the attic and always dreamed of the castle she could see from her window.

So he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so that the prince could meet all the girls in the village. And the invitations get sent out. And the stepmother opens the invitation and says, oh, it's going to be a grand ball. And all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince.And Cinderella overhears her telling the story to stepsisters, and she says, oh, I want to go. I'm eligible maiden.

She says, wash the floor.And someone says, I washed the floor yesterday. She says, we'll do it again, and she ought to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball. And as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons.

I had an older brother.I have an older brother, and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then, and the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get to the top of a wheelchair. I've got wheelchair in my brain to get to the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed. But I was pretty scraped up from and I decided I didn't like following suit with the shimming of a tree, so they shimmied down. I was not going to shimmy down.So my brother, he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and tried to my mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff, but no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast, so you had to stay propped for a little bit, but minus that, it was a walking cast.I was fine. That's what I remember of that. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating. But what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues, or did I'm going to have to tell the same story.So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church, where I was their Sunday school teacher for ten years and still go to Eagleari with them for special needs retreats. It's a group of about five to 600 special needs, most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities, which includes like, the big square dance. So you just help them, whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they have a hard time walking. But most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate and hear over top of it.The three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers, of which only one communicates. I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two don't. It's a series of grunts, some sign language. Over the years, I've, of course, learned the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. We have her weding ring upstairs.He brings money in his pocket. That's his dowry so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate, but through his sign. It's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying. His sister and his mom usually know, so they are communicators, but they're communicators for them, put it that way.Um, they will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with. So it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer. And by facial expressions, you know?"

        "transcript": "This last spring, I was down in the basement doing some work and I decided to come flying up the steps. And I flew it. But the problem was I had both hands full of papers and I didn't hold on to the brailing, which I usually do. I'm usually careful. So I went flying around the corner and as I turned the corner and hit the third step I slipped and fell backwards and hit the wall.And, of course, I fell flat on the landing. There I was. And I thought, well, I can get up. But I couldn't get up. There was no way I could get up.So there I was, and I guess I went in and out. I don't really remember. But there I was on the landing and I couldn't get up and I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen and he's watching TV and maybe I'll be able to get up later. And I won't tell him that I was so foolish just to come up the steps and fall.So I lay there a little bit longer and I woke up again and I couldn't get up. So I just lay there, and I kept going in and out. And finally, sometime later it was at least 30 minutes he wandered by the door and the door from the floor was open down to the stairs. So he looked at and said, what are you doing down there? And I said, I can't get up.And he said, well, that won't do. So he came down and he tried to get me up and I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done. But I couldn't move. So he said, we need to call the ambulance. And I said, oh, no, I'll be able to get up.And he said, we really ought to call the ambulance. But my next door neighbor was a urologist and his wife was a nurse. And I said, well, maybe you can call them. And they came over, and the doctor looked at me and he said, Call the ambulance. So we called the ambulance, and then we called my daughter, who also lives in Lexington and she met us at the hot.That's where she came to the house. And the amulist came and the fire truck came and we got it. And they brought down because I had a neck injury, obviously, I couldn't move my neck couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body and they brought it in and from each side these two big burly men working on either side of me trying to get me up. And the landing wasn't all that wide.They finally got me up, and they didn't want me to move at all. So they carted me up the stairs. And I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about it ever since. They said to each other, she doesn't weigh as much as a six pack. So this has been the joke with the whole thing.They got me up, and they were absolutely marvelous. On the way to the hospital, they kept telling me where they were and it wouldn't be too much longer because I really was in pain. And I got to the hospital and of course, they'd called ahead. They took me straight through to Critical Care and they were ready for me. And the rest of the night I was in and out.But I had marvelous care. I had marvelous people who were professionals who were working with me all night long. And they kept trying to check and be sure. I didn't have any brain damage, I didn't have any nerve damage. But I had a broken neck.The second cervical was broken, so they had this cast on me. The minute that they were there, they had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital. But then the next morning they put on the I forgot exactly what it is. It's a J thing. It's in two pieces."

        "transcript": "Well, I've had a lot my fair share, I guess difference, but the most recent was I discovered had colon cancer last March and discovered it quite by accident. I'd been sick the whole month of February with the flu. And when I finally got over the flu had been on steroid antibiotics. I still was running a low grade fever and being nauseated at night and went on for a little while, but I still didn't think it was right. So I went back to the doctor, I think that was the fifth or 6th time I'd been in like four or five weeks.And for whatever reason that he doesn't know and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy and thought that was kind of unusual. I had a ticket to plane ticket to California. So he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day and he did find a surgeon who would and went in for the colonoscopy and they kind of put you out. And when I got up off the table I said, well, did you find anything? And he said yes, and I said, Cancer?And he said yes. And I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday.Monday. He explained to me the extent to what I had.He thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. So they scheduled the operation, believe it or not, two weeks down the road. And I said, then I'm going to California. I'm not going to sit around here and worry about, know, two weeks. I just can believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer they would schedule you two weeks down the road.The doctor called me that night and asked me some questions, which I thought was really unusual to have a doctor call you. That doesn't happen very often. And the next morning his nurse called me at seven from the hospital and they were doing surgery. She said, we can get you in Friday if you'll stay. And I said, well, if you can get me in Friday, then I'll stay.So I was scheduled for surgery Friday and had it. And he ended up taking my whole colon, although I left enough to poke everything back up, which was very fortunate, but he thought he got it all, which of course is everybody's first question.So anyway, I was in the hospital. I don't remember. I was on morphine and kind of out of it. Had trouble. Had a lot of trouble with my IV.And like I said, I was on morphine, so the IV thing kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on morphine, I guess. But anyway, they would let that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring. It was driving us on. I mean, they wait 15 minutes and it's like a car door. The ding, ding, ding, ding.And I saw every time I would want to sleep, that thing would wake me up. Well, after a day of that, I was ready to kill some. And they just would let it go. Even though we'd call them or whatever. They'd just take their sweet time getting in there.Well, my son got here from Newburn."

        "transcript": "Okay, thank you. Once upon a time, there was a wealthy gentleman who had a lovely wife and a sweet little daughter. Unfortunately, the wife got very ill and died, and so they were very sad for a while. And eventually, the father decided that he really wanted to marry again. So he went out into the city and found another woman that was interested in marrying him, so he chose to marry her.She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than the young girl that the man had. And when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife, was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually, it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the gentleman's daughter, was really forced to do all the work in the house. And the daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day.And in fact, they made Cinderella sleep near the fireplace or next to the fireplace, and she ended up being covered with ashes from the fireplace. So they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her. Time went on, and Cinderella's only friends, really, were the animals in the household. All of them, including the dog and cat and mice, and even the rats, were her friends. And so time went on, and they all grew older, and they were in their probably late teens, maybe, when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman.And the stepsisters were not quite so beautiful, partly because they were mean and nasty. So they lived in a kingdom with a king who lived in a palace in the center of the city, and he had a son, and the king wanted his son, the prince, to marry. Well, the prince had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about, and the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom. So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies of the kingdom would be invited, and the prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he'd like to marry. They hoped everybody received an invitation.The stepmother received their invitation and was, of course, very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder. She was excited. The stepmother told the three stepsisters about the ball, and they were excited. So everybody was running around getting all prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes.And finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball. And Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find find something that she herself could wear, but of course, she couldn't find much of anything great. And so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the stepsisters laughed at her and said, you can't go to the ball looking like that. Nobody would want to see."

        "transcript": "Okay. The first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese, and everybody there spoke Japanese. So it was frustrating. I had to put children in school. I had to take some shopping to get their uniforms.I had to take a taxi and tell him where he wanted to go and how to get home. And so how did I deal with it? I studied Japanese every morning, five days a week, until I got so I could do it happened again when I went to Korea. It happened again when I went to Guatemala and Brazil, where they did not speak English. I spoke English in Jamaica and spoke English in Malaysia at that time.But the only time that I've really had what I call a serious communication problem is when I have been transported into a place where people don't speak my language and I have to communicate it, and I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time. And I find I do it by reading body language, reading facial expressions, a lot of this moving hands to describe what I want. And then as the language picks up on my part, I have, like, the back to do that's. Pretty much my experience with that.Were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared?Yes. Okay, what happened? Tell me the story. Start from the beginning. Okay.I was on a boat, a ship, I should say. The USS president of mine was President Wilson. And we were sailing from, I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my husband and my two youngsters were there. They were probably in third and fourth grade.And we came in we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up. So the captain notified us, there's a busy weather out there, and so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon started, and the two of them met, and our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. My children, one of them was thrown out of her bunk and hit her head on a wash basin.And we strapped them in something. I can't remember exactly, because I was miserable. I was seasick, and I was on the prom deck, and they had storm windows up because the prom you're supposed to be able to see, but they had these bad weather, big thick windows up. And I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair watching the waves come up over me, and then I would hear crashing.And when we would go up real high, the ship would creak and go and then go down. I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life. They had ropes for people. If you had to go to the bathroom or something, you couldn't walk, so you would do this to try and find your way. They had bed sprints pulled off all the beds that were in the Persherance area.Trying."

And I actually was doing some interpreting for him at one time or another because I understood what he was same. And that was to me, it was probably the most difficult one that I had to deal with, not because I didn't understand him, but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him. But I also spent some time in mexico, and there's people down there that speak no.I've had to adapt, and I've learned to speak a little bit of spanish, enough to get by things like gustan servesa or donde albano. The important stuff, the beginning was we were planning a trip to cancun, mexico, and we were at the time we'd been discussing this, and we were just standing in line at the movie theater, and it just happened. The couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to mexico, and they started talking about cozumel and cancun, and mainly cozumel, which we had planned to go see, to go to the island of, you know, travel around there a little bit because there's some ruins there. It's a really nice place. Well, the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex marine or something.He was just perfectly built, and they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab. They had gotten near the port. I think they were doing one of the princess cruises or something. So they had come into port and had been spent the day there, and then they had to get back to the ship, so they hired a cab. Well, the cab starts going the other direction, and he kept telling him, no, you're going the wrong way.The port's over here. You need to go back this way. And he wouldn't stop, and he kept saying not to worry. I know, shortcut. It's okay.And he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop, and he and his wife just jumped out of the vehicle as it was moving, and people in the neighborhood that they had jumped out into started screaming about yelling for the federalis because they knew that there was an abduction that was underway. So here we are, maybe a month away, not even a month away from our trip, and thinking about this. We get there to cozumel, and as soon as you get off the ferry, there's all these cab drivers there and wanting to take you around the city or around the island. So this one comes.It was kind of like, hey, pick me type thing in our mind. So we went over to."

So off he went to school with his backpack on and he got halfway there almost when it started to pour rain, and he didn't want to go to school and he didn't want to face his mom, so he had to choose between two bad choices. And he returned home, where he changed clothes. Mom handed him his umbrella, and off he went to school on his second trip that day, but was late.Tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can.There was a man and a woman got married, and the woman had two little girls, young girls by her first marriage, and the man had a little girl by his first marriage. And so they combined their families, and the two stepsisters, I think, were not very nice to the new stepsister, and they were a little older and they ordered her around and they were really mean to her. So she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals, more so than her new stepsisters or siblings in the land that they live. And the girls grew up to become young ladies and with Cinderella virtually becoming the personal servant of her two stepsisters. In the land that they lived, there was a king who had a son who would take his place.But the king was concerned that his son was unmarried and they needed to socialize and decided that they would have a ball in which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a marvelous ball at the Royal Palace. And the invitation came in the mail, and the two stepsisters were very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the young prince to be of interest, but they planned and schemed that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend and was excluded. And when it came time to leave for the ball, cinderella was left behind, but was visited by a fairy prince, who, knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella, said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella and turned her into this beautiful young lady. And and provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin and told her that she was going to go to the ball, which she did, but that she had to leave and be home by midnight."

So she's been working on this ball gown. Last minute, her stepsisters say, no, you can't go, because why would he fall in love with you?You're just this little working girl."

Well, eventually, Cinderella's father also passed away, and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother. Her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her their servant, basically everyone. They were very cruel to her, and she lived a very meager life.But she was friends with all the animals. The animals were the people she got along with, people she could talk to or the creatures that she could talk to. And then one day there was a prince in that country and they were going to hold a ball for him to find his wife as it was time for him to marry.And Cinderella and her stepsisters were very excited to go. However, Cinderella could not go unless she had finished all her chores. Her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish and she said Cinderella could only go if she had finished all her chores first. So by the time it came to go, cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go. But unbeknownst to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores, using fragments of her stepsister's clothes and such that they had cast away because they didn't want it.So Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her. And while the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it, cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress, very happy to go. Then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things that they had cast away. And they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters. And she went out to the yard and was crying.And then fairy Godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight. She made her very beautiful and all that, but she warned her it would only last till midnight. And she turned a pumpkin into a carriage and transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful. And so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince, and I guess it was love at first sight. And they were dancing together, and he very much enjoyed his time with her.And they were dancing outside, and she saw the clock, and she noticed it was almost midnight. So she went racing down the stairs, leaving one of her glass slippers behind, and she went racing off the carriage. And she actually didn't make it quite home when it struck midnight and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin. The carriage turned back into a pumpkin, and everything went back to the way it was, except for one of her glass slippers. And so this prince, after this happened, he was very interested in finding her.He wondered why she had ran away. And so he set out to search for her using the glass slip."

        "transcript": "And finally, the mom called the fire department because she didn't know how to get the dad or the cat out of the tree. So the firefighters came with their ladder, and they're rushing to the scene so they can rescue both the dad and the cat from the tree. So I'm going to have you look at these pictures that tell a story. There's going to be several slides that are just the pictures of the story. They are automatically going to advance after 30 seconds.But if you're ready to move on before 30 seconds, just say, next, and I'll go to the next slide. At the end, there will be an opportunity for you to review any slides if you wish to have extra time to look at any slides. And then I'm going to stop sharing my screen with you and have you retell the story of Cinderella without looking at the pictures. Okay, so we can go ahead and start. Just say next if you're ready to move on.Next.Next.Next.All right. Do you want to go back and review any pictures or slides? No, thanks. All right, so now tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can. You can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it.Okay. So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away, and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters. But they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her, as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked Cinderella to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did.So one day, they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess. And the stepsisters were very excited about it, and so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and stepsister said, oh, well, you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years. And it was a beautiful dress, and she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball.And when her stepsister saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried, and the stepsisters went off to the ball, and along came Cinderella's fairy godmother. And she said, oh, well, you can go to the ball. And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters. And Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to all.She danced with the Prince and had a wonderful time but remembered that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were.Sorry. That was my."

        "transcript": "Wow, that's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. So what's he do? Like, any sane person, he bends down and gives her a kiss. He's like, hey, maybe this will work. And she wakes up and they get married, and they go off and live happily ever after.That was awesome. It it like any sane person would do. Yeah, any sane person. You see a sleeping girl, nothing else works. I mean, you kiss her, if one of two things are going to happen, she's either going to wake up and slap you well, one of three things wake up and slap you.Wake up and just say, whoa, what happened? Or just not wake up at all. You got three options. Two of them are good. The third one, it's a little rough, but no worse off than it was before.Exactly. Didn't hurt anything.Okay. So now I'm going to have you do the same thing with Little Red writing.Just a nice home where all right. And so remember, you can use anything that you remember as well as the pictures from the book to tell the story. All right? So Little Red Riding Hood's at her house with her mom, and her mom's baking some muffins and bread and some snacks for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her granny. So she's out playing with the animals while her mom's doing that.And then she gets the basket from inside, and she's like, okay, well, I'm off to Granny's. Well, while she's going off to her grandmother, she gets a little sidetracked playing with the animals, and she runs into this wolf. And wolf's like, hey, where are you going? She's like, Well, I'm going over here to my granny's house. I got a basket full of goodies for.So, like, the wolf goes over and looks in the basket, and she's like, hey, leave that alone. That's not for you. And so the wolf's like, if I get there first, maybe I can get these goodies. So the wolf runs on ahead and gets to Granny's house and knocks on the door. And Granny comes and answers the door, and it's a wolf.So, I mean, she runs off. She's scared. Wolf's like, I have an idea. And so he dressed up in one of Granny's nightgowns and put on a sleeping cap and grabbed her glasses and crawled into the bed. And Little Red Riding Hood gets to the door and knocks, and the wolf disguises its voice.It's like, Come on in, sweetie. Little Red Riding Hood's like, okay, Granny. And she opens the door and sets the basket down, and she's like, Granny, are you feeling okay? Yeah, sweetie. And so she goes a little bit closer."

        "transcript": "Let me talk about when I went to Belgium as a cultural exchange student, which was, I would say, kind of life changing. When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio, and I had the opportunity to travel as part of the International Foreign Youth Exchange, which is a four H associated organization. I was big in four H when I was young because I grew up in Ohio, so grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity.Ohio, the state of Ohio sends several people every year to go to a foreign country, and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others. And it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up, so I always knew that I wanted to do that. And since I had taken French all through high school, I thought, oh, well, go to a French speaking country. And France wasn't available, but Belgium was, so I chose Belgium, and luckily I got to go there.I soon found out that learning high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium, so it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English, so I had to learn French, and that's the best way to learn it, I think. But when I say it was life changing, it really kind of made me think about, first of all, that other people are not like us in the United States, and really got me thinking about how can I do what I do as a speech pathologist in other countries?So I immediately came home and interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist. And they said, well, you got to get your master's degree back then you didn't have to have your master's degree in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my master's and met my husband, got married, had children, that kind of thing. But it's always been something. I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full time professor and did a lot of international work that way.So I was doing telepractice before it was cool, actually, and got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and that kind of thing. So still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. I still keep in touch with some of my host families in Belgium, and we've hosted kids from other countries for other programs as think, and I always encourage my children.I hope they will get to, if not study abroad, then travel a little bit more than I did growing up. It just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it. Now, these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them. Tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end.And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard, and all of a sudden, he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face. Take a look at these pictures that tell a story.I'll ask you to. You tell me a story also with a beginning, middle, and end, and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mother said, oh, you definitely need to take your umbrella to."

        "transcript": "So, once upon a time, there was a very wicked lady who had three daughters, and one day, her husband, I think, adopted or brought in a new child into the household. And the sisters or the three sisters did not like this new child. And they commanded her to do all kinds of menial work and tasks and do their laundry and sweep the floors. But she consoled herself in her friendship with animals. And be it horses or dogs or even mice, she was very friendly to animals.What love she didn't get from her sisters or the sisters in the household. She got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her tasks. Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold a ball. And the household was invited to the ball. So Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited.But her sisters told her differently. And furthermore, they told her that she was not only not invited, but she was not appropriately dressed or did not have a dress that would suit the occasion. So they left for the ball. And Cinderella was very sad. But here comes the fairy, the godmother fairy, and says, what would you like to do, my child?And she says, I would like to go to the So, but I don't have a dress. And the fairies said, no problem. We're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand. And Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes. Not only that, but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball.So she goes to the ball and impresses everybody, including the prince, the king's son, who falls desperately in love with her. But the fairy had said you must be back by midnight or you're going to turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella hurries back and makes it back before midnight, but leaves behind a shoe. So the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry. But where was she?She was nowhere to be seen. So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe. And they had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfectly. And they went through the sisters. And even the mother tried her luck, but the shoe would not fit.And so no candidate was found to marry the prince until one of the animals told the surveyor that she should try it on cinderella. And when the surveyor did that, the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly. So the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball and they lived happily ever after. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.So you get two slices of bread."

        "transcript": "In the beginning of the story, cinderella and her father were moving to a new house, and he was getting a new wife who would be Cinderella's stepmother. Her stepmother had two little girls that were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat, and Cinderella had a dog, and Cinderella thought everything could be good. And her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up, the stepsisters really were not nice to Cinderella.They were evil stepsisters. They did things like they made her do all the chores, then throw things at her, then make her clean the floors, clean the cinders out of the fireplace, then make her take care of all the animals, including their cat. And their cat didn't like Cinderella, so that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were mice. So that was kind of a tough thing to do. Cinderella obviously was sad.So every night she would go to her room and she'd look out her window and she could see in the distance, she could see the palace. And she looked at the palace and says, oh, I wish I could go there someday just to see what it's like. So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king and his right hand man would go through and try to figure out what was needed, because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well, he had a son who was a prince, but the prince did not have a wife, and he wanted the prince to have a wife before he would give him the kingdom.So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the village. And they sent out invitations to everybody. And the stepmother got the invitation and was reading it, and Cinderella read it over her back, over her shoulder. And Cinderella thought, well, I'm a girl in the village. I get to go.And her stepmother didn't say anything, but her stepsisters were, no way. You can't go. Got to have a ball gown. So she did her ball gown. She didn't have a ball gown, that is so she went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of ball gowns that she could have.And she talked to her friends, the mice, and they took a dress that she had, and they put bows and frills on it and things like that and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need. I can go now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave.And when they saw her dress, they were upset. One of the stepsisters ripped her dress, and one of them ripped her necklace off of her. And of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset."

        "transcript": "And no eight thinks to herself, yep, I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all. And she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite.And then she collapses. And the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm going to be real. The first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. I can only get a wedge out, and then from there, I can take proper bites.But apparently Snow white has awesome jaw strength as well as in human beauty. So anyway, she collapses, the apple rolls out of her hand, the crone cackles maniacally, as you are, want to do, and runs out. And then I assume she like hobbles out because she's still a crone. Maybe she turned no, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway.But anyway, the old crone hobbles away, and all the dwarves come hi hoing home, and they see Snow white pass out on the floor, and they're like, again, but then they realize that she's not breathing too well or at all. And so they get on the backs of deer, I think. Like they ride deer to go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this crone. Presumably, she just leaves a really obvious trail, but they follow her and I don't know, there's a lightning storm or something, I think, and the crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer.Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her, and they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car, specifically. And I believe it. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying.But anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded men riding them. And so she's understandably freaked out. And she climbs up onto this mountain, and she's trying to hang onto the edge because she's about to fall. And then lightning strikes the stick she's holding onto and the ground beneath her feet crumbles and she falls, presumably to her death, but probably not for sure in case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development.They did that in Rapunzel in Tankbold lubicopt's probably dead. I hope she's dead. She was scary. So the evil queen as the crone falls to her death, and all the dwarves were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on Snow white.And so they race back to Snow White, but she is still dead. And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical. Again, but this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin, and they're mourning her, and there are flowers and tears and furry wildebeests crying. And suddenly the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion and he says, what the heck?The pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm going to kiss her, because that is the logical next step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her and she wakes up. I assume she like, just hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple and took it out of her mouth and that was censored.That seems logical, because if he's going to kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Good luck or go home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so she sits up and thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her, because otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again, because she does that a lot."

        "transcript": "Once upon a time, there is a little girl named Cinderella, and she lived with her dad. Her mom had died years ago, so it was just herself and her dad. And then one day, her dad remarried and brought a new mom with two stepsisters home to meet Cinderella and was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom. Well, Cinderella and her dad really loved each other, and they were a family again with a new mom and two stepsisters. But then Cinderella's dad died, and the stepmom was not a very nice mom, and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella.And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes and scrub the floor and make the beds and make the food, and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family. And they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there. And she would look out her window, and she could see far beyond the city, the castle.And she would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would want to go and see. Well, meanwhile, there was the prince, and the prince wasn't married yet. And the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom. And so they decided to do a ball, which is a big dance, and they were going to make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in the town come to the ball. And so the prince could pick one of the sisters or one of the single girls to be his wife.And so they sent out invitations, and every home got an invitation for this big dance, and everybody was invited. And so the stepmother and the two stepsisters, they were so excited to go to this dance, and they were going to dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family, too. And the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you.You're shabby, and you don't have any clothes to wear. And the stepmother said, if you do all your chores, you can go. And, oh, Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball. And so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball. And so they made her a dress, and, oh, it looks so pretty.So the night of the ball, cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball. And they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done. And here comes Cinderella, and she comes down the stairs and she goes, oh, wait for me. I can go, too. And the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her and they were appalled.They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear. And they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her and they cinderella, you can't go. Look at you.You look like a little merchant and no prince would ever want to look at you. And so they said they were off to the ball."

        "transcript": "Okay, so the story of Cinderella is that her mom died and her dad remarried this really mean woman who had these really terrible daughters. And so they all move in together. And I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old mean woman wouldn't be marrying him. But when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really meet Cinderella. So Cinderella is she's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do.And so she's pretty much a slave. Again, I don't know where the dad is during all this. So she works for a long time because in the story it showed her as a little girl and then later on it's like eight years later. So apparently this happened for a long time. This girl is going to need some help.So she is still working for the family. And then she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time. And then there's that castle and she's like, oh, where other people live who I'm sure have a great life. So then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife. I don't know, this sounds very crazy as I'm saying it, but it's true.So they have this dance so that the prince could find a wife and they invite everybody in the kingdom. And apparently again her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants. But her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come. But she thinks she's going to come. So she gets to try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that, help her get ready.And then the stepsisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book they take her necklace and tear her dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top. But they do and they're really mean and so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out.I don't know if she rubs a lamp in there. Maybe she read a book. I don't remember that part. But anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So she asks her fairy godmother, I guess, to go to the dance.I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. This is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that one night is going to help. But anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So very godmother gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up and then puts her in a pumpkin, sends her away.So she gets to go to the dance. And it looks like she had a nose job. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much, much smaller and her hair is much, much blonder when she goes to the dance. So something happens and she gets dressed up and she goes to the dance. And lo and behold, the prince falls in love with her.And so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess, are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off, which the last shoes anyway, I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken them off 15 minutes after getting there. So she lost her shoe. And then all the prince knows is that girl that he loves wore this shoe.So he said, sends his lackey guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe. And it's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this."

They had to call the fire department to come and rescue to him while the dog's barking up the tree at father and the father's ladder is laying on the ground where it should be up against a tree.When I had my heart attack we lived up at Roosevelt Lake and I knew I was having something when I was out in the garage putting our stuff away we had brought back from Alpine and I was storing it in the garage and I went in and my left side felt like it was going to explode. And I told my wife, I said, Call 911. So she did and if this luck would have it, the ambulance was only five minutes away. So they got there and started work and they were talking to doctors and their headquarters and I heard the doctor say, don't try to bring him in the ambulance, we're sending a helicopter out. So they said you got a good place so you meet it on top of the hill with Mr.Ramsey and the ambulance. So they said okay. So they loaded me in the ambulance, and it was only about half a mile to the top of the hill. And they just had got there when a helicopter landed. And they loaded me on the helicopter and flew me in the globe.And they stabilized me in a globe. And my family doctor was there and he asked me, he said, do you have a cardiologist? I've never needed one. Said okay, said I'll get one, so just wait just a minute. He went back and he called this cardiologist and made an appointment for him to meet the helicopter at the emergency room door when they landed and they did.And when they unloaded me off the helicopter at Good Samaritan Hospital well he was there and he said, okay, we'll take him from here. So they took me in and started checking me over and I heard him say, yes, he has a major heart attack. And they started performing angioplastic surgery on me so they could put a stent in the block. So they went up both sides and as they was going up I heard the anesthesia geologists say, we've lost him. And that's when I had visions of what it would be like if I really died."

You have stepmother with her two girls and then Cinderella and her father.I guess something happened to him. That one I don't remember. But Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters. Those sisters are jealous of her. And let's see, Cinderella spends a lot of time by herself."

        "transcript": "The game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other. And points in the sport are called runs.The way that the playing field is set up is there's a diamond and there's four bases at each point of the diamond. The diamond is on one point and such that the bottom point is called home plate. And then going counterclockwise around the clock, there's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate.The team that is in the field and on defense, they're allowed to have gloves and there's a ball that is in play. The other team that is trying to score the runs at that point has a bat and they have some protective equipment, including helmets and such. The way that the game starts is one team is on defense. So they take the field and there's certain positions for each player. There's nine active players per side.So the defensive team has nine players out in the field. The offensive team has one bat player that starts at home plate and he's called the batter. The team that is in the field first is the visiting team to the stadium. The home team, I take it back. The visiting team backs first.The home team is on the field first. The way that the game is set up, there are nine, what are called innings. And an inning consists of where each team gets to bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs and then they switch sides, where the home team then comes to bat and the visiting team then is in the field. And then they get three outs.Once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning. And you do nine of those sets. In the defensive position, there's several different positions. There's nine positions. One of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher.And then at home plate is the catcher. And then we go around. We go have a first baseman, a second baseman, a third baseman. There's someone that stands between third and second base, called a shortstop. And then beyond the diamond is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out their goal.The defensive goal is to there's two ways you can make an out. You can catch the ball in the fly, actually three ways. Make it out now catch the ball in the fly. If the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate, the batter hits it. If the batter hits the ball and someone in the field catches it for hits the ground, that is one out.There's something called balls and strikes where if the batter misses with his bat and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the actual physical base. At home plate, that's called a strike. If it's outside that lateral movement, it's called a ball. You get three strikes or the batter is out, or if you get four balls, then the battery gets a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out.If the batter makes it to first base before the throw gets there, he is safe on first base."

        "transcript": "Cinderella's dad got remarried, and so she acquired not only a stepmother, but two stepsisters, who were kind of ugly. And they were pretty mean to Cinderella. So Cinderella did spend a lot of time with the animals outside, beside working, sweeping up Cinders and cleaning the house and doing things for her stepsisters, who seemed to spend a lot of time on their looks, looking in the mirror and fixing themselves up. One day, they all had an invitation from the Prince to go to a ball at the castle. So of course, Cinderella was not going to be allowed to go.She didn't have the clothes to do it. But the ugly stepsisters were dressed up and the stepmoma was too, and they all left for the ball. Cinderella was sad, but she accepted it. And along came her fairy godmother. And her Fairy Godmother brought out her magic wand and tapped different things.Pumpkin turned into a coach and the mice turned into, I don't know, Carriagemen. I don't know what they're called. And Cinderella had a beautiful gown and pretty glass flippers. And then they all went to the ball. And the only stipulation was that at midnight, she would have to return to her Cinderella state.So she went to the ball and the Prince and Cinderella danced. And he was very taken with her, with not only her beauty, but her manners. She was a very sweet person. And she looked up at the clock and the clock was getting ready to strike midnight, so she ran down the stairs and lost one of her slippers, her glass slippers, and returned to her house, where she was again quiet in her old clothes. And the Carriagemen returned to their mice and Pumpkin status.And when her stepmama and stepsisters came home, they were raving about the ball that they had gone to. And Cinderella didn't say that she had gone, so she went back to her normal life. In the meantime, the Prince was trying to find Cinderella. She had disappeared so rapidly and he wanted to be able to see her again. So he sent out on a search for her with his manservants.And they came to I don't know what her stepmother's name was, but they came to their home. And the ugly stepsisters, of course, thought that they would fit into the glass slippers. And whoever did was going to, of course, be part of the Prince's life, so they couldn't fit into it. And he went out and Cinderella was outside and he stopped to try it on Cinderella. Lo and behold, the slipper fit.So Cinderella and the Prince were married and went away from the stepmother and stepsisters and lived happily ever after."

He was rattled. He hopped up, he got that soccer ball. He looked out the window, and out the window, he could see Ferdinand. I mean, he could see Sam, but he knew he could not go say anything to Sam because of the coronavirus.So Ferdinand kept the ball in his house.

He lived with his mother, and his mother knew that it was supposed to rain that day. So she told Bennett that he needed to take his umbrella with him to school. But Bennett said no, mom, it's not raining outside. I don't need an umbrella.He refused to take the umbrella. She said, you're going to need this later on. She wasn't happy with him, but he refused and said goodbye. Well, as he was walking to school, sure enough, it started to rain. By the time he got to school, he was pretty wet, and he spent the day drying out his shoes in school.And he got his chair wet, but it all dried out eventually. But by the time he was ready to come home, it was not only raining, it was pouring, and there were puddles on the sidewalk. He stepped into all those puddles. He ran in the rain to get home as fast as he could. By the time he got home, he was drenched, and his mother could not help herself.She said, I told you so. Bennet. Bennett felt bad about that and knew that his mother was right. So the next day, when it was still raining, he took his umbrella to school. We're going to look at one more picture that you're going to look at.Take as long as you need, and then tell me a story about what you see, with the beginning, a middle and an end.One day, Hannah was out riding her tricycle, and as she was riding her tricycle, she what happened? Oh, yeah, okay. She was riding her tricycle, but she was chasing after her cat. Her cat had run out and run down the street, but she got off her tricycle because the cat not only had run down the street, the cat ran up the tree, and her cat would not come down. Well, pretty soon, she called for her dad, and her dad got out the ladder.Her dad started climbing up the ladder he climbed up the tree trying to get the cat. But while he was sitting on the tree trying to reach the cat, their dog came running out into the yard and knocked the ladder over, barking, barking, barking up the tree at dad. So then, not only could dad not reach the cat, but dad couldn't get down because the dog had knocked over the ladder while mom was inside looking out the window."

If anything happens, I can hold it over my head, and I won't get as wet, so I'm not going to take the umbrella.I'll be fine. I no sooner got down the road than, wouldn't you know, lo and behold, it started to rain. The rain turned into a torrent, and I was actually getting very soaked from head to toe. My backpack was wet. My shoes were even wet.I got back to the house, and my mom looked at me and didn't say a word. But she knew. After changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack, I headed out again on my way to school, this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain. The Story of Cinderella once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a young girl whose parents had died. She had an aunt, but her aunt was a very bitter person, so she and the children, her children, her daughters were living in the house.But Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid. She had to keep the house cleaned up, no matter what. As she grew older, she grew more and more beautiful. But even as beautiful as she was, she was still just the housemaid.The other girls grew up. They weren't near as beautiful as she was.In the meantime, the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married. And to do that, he wanted to have a great ball. He sent out invitations to all the influential people within the land that they could attend the ball. Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation and had decided to send her two daughters. Cinderella said, well, can I also go?And her mother said, no, you can't. You're to stay here and keep this place clean.So while she was doing that, she became a little bit disconcerted. And all at once, she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball, because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard. All at once, her fairy godmother came to see her, and she asked what she really wanted. And she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball. So her fairy godmother waved her wand and gave her the most beautiful dress and a tierra and glass slippers to wear to take her off to the ball.She had to have a coach.So she went into the garden, and there was a pumpkin."

This can be a happy story, sad from any time childhood up until more recently.Just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about. And you can take time to think, if you'd like. I was going to say, because I'm going to try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injury stories. What wasn't important?As soon as I hang up from you, I'll go, Why didn't I tell her that? What is important?Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things is my daughter's gallbladder, because I haven't had too many injuries or life stopping moments as I have when that hit last January and she had called me not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU health that went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so and oh, my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that. I'm not sure who was going to bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work.She had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to, I guess Jackie was still there at that point, and Mark. And when I called her, she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the Er, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get intravenous. Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth if that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not.And Mark did take her to the Er. They did release her. It wasn't long after that. IU then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying.And then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know, you know that they need you. So it was a decision whether to hop a plane that night, and I decided not to. Yes, Jackie. It was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day and we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was our chauffeur for the entire time we were in the doctor's office.And he admitted her into the hospital for that night and the surgery was the following night.I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night, which I was glad that I did, because she was with it, but not really with it, but staying there with her for a few days afterwards, she was a trooper. But none of my children have really been sick. So to be so far away and not be able to be there immediately all turned out good. But as you know, there's still issues."

So she got her dad to climb the tree and get the kitty, who was way out on the end of a branch. The ladder had been knocked over.The fire department came running with their ladder to try and help. Little bird is chirping away like nothing had all happened. So a couple of weeks ago, Jesus Christ Superstar was coming to town, and my daughter got excellent tickets for she and I to go just kind of front and center in the orchestra pit. And it came out during my teenage years, so I taught myself the music. I was really looking forward to this.Well, in the meantime, this is just after Easter. My granddaughter that our whole extended family lived together, and she had gotten the stomach flu. A couple days later, her mom, my oldest daughter, got it. And lo and behold, the day that we had tickets for Jesus Christ Superstar, I got this stomach virus. And you didn't know you had it until you were losing things from your body, and it just knocked you completely for a loop.So I was already mad enough being sick, but to miss was even worse. Oh, yeah. I laid in bed and about 715, 15 minutes after it started, I was feeling a whole lot better. But, yeah, there was couldn't go could not go to the plane. And then by morning, I was back to work.Just a day deal. Not even quite 24 hours.That was my last illness. Yes. My youngest daughter, and this was a year ago, she was a senior in high school and quite an athlete. And it was track season, and she's a good runner, a good high jumper. And we were at a meet that had kind of old equipment, and she did her high jump and the mat spread and she fell, landed on her back, legs up over her head, was cocked up, and it just was too much for me.I'm fine, I'm fine. The next day, I took her to a chiropractor that we know, and she kept saying she was fine, and apparently with this injury, she was. But that next day, then after he had kind of adjusted her and said, everything really, truly is fine, she got very ill and she wound up having mono. And it was the worst case. The pediatricians and the chiropractor said they had seen in many, many years.I've never seen I don't know any children that have had cancer, so I'm not trying to compare it with that because you do get over this. But I've never seen one of my kids that ill, that sick. They didn't think she'd graduate, let alone get back to track or even start ASU in the fall. She was down and just the pain, you get all this stuff in your neck and just swollen, going like Frankenstein. It was very, very scary.But I credit well, God and the chiropractor, he did a lot of immune stuff and and she did graduate. She was able to finish school. She got to state because she had already qualified before she got sick and actually meddled not in all the events she wanted to, but she did get to do her high jump."

I was in the Bahamas, this time with friends from the sailing club, and we met well, the month of February is broken into 310 day shifts where people would meet at the boat, and a few people were there for the whole month because they were retired and had enough time and money to do it. But the rest of us were there for ten day periods and we met the boat at Paradise Atlantis, paradise Island Resort in Nassau in the Bahamas. We were on the boat for ten days, and by the time we got back, I mean, by the time our time was over, we were back in Fort Lauderdale where the boat had been rented, and it was a real fun trip. We did a lot of snorkeling.The water is just absolutely beautiful, and most of the Bahamas, the water is only about less than 20ft deep. So as you're sailing to the next place and we didn't always know where we're going to drop anchor and hang out for the night, sometimes in just some totally uninhabited area, or sometimes near an island where it could go to shore and explore the shore and go to a restaurant.I've been on other trips like this before, but this one was really good. It was a catamaran, which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between and got into some storms at night where we were just bouncing around like crazy all night.Ah, we ate a lot, drank a lot, snorkeled a lot, got a lot of great underwater pictures, barracudas and things.The very last night of the trip, me and the captain, this is the guy who we'd all met at our Salem Club when he was living in Bloomington working on a journalism degree. Then he moved back to Florida and he arranged us renting the boat for the month. And he'd grown up in Florida and the Bahamas and knew the area pretty well, but was also a real character.He was like in his 30s going on twenty s at one of the people because he was kind of goofy. You never know what to expect from him. He's kind of not grown up in some ways, but he was also about 62 with Scandinavian looking with blonde hair and blue eyes, except his hair was in dreadlocks.And Hesso had some history of of smuggling people and smoke and booze and stuff from the Bahamas back to Florida."

So she comes up with a really elaborate potion. And the potion is like it'll give whoever bites it everlasting slumber instead of killing them outright. Which seems ridiculous, really.Snow White will sleep forever and she can only be awakened by love, true love's first kiss.And the witch is like, true love bad. I'll never have him.

She falls into like yeah, like she falls down to a river so you don't see her for the rest of the movie. She's basically defeated. But then Snow White's still in the coma.Oh, also at the beginning of the story I forgot to say that Snow White was really into true love and waiting for prince and stuff.And so she's like, one day, my prince will so at the end of the movie I mean, the story the prince is like I've heard about this sleeping Beauty.

So whenever I have felt that I couldn't stand it, I would push that button. Then I remember seeing my daughter's face. I remember seeing her and her husband.And I don't remember ever communicating with them.

I remember another thing sitting sitting up straight in the hospital, watching in my bed, watching a new patient come in to replace the one next to me and went out just like that.And the nurse came in later and I could hear her talking. That's it. She was saying, Boy, she fell asleep sitting up. And I thought, I'm not asleep, I'm just gaga.And that's pretty much it. And I remember the therapy afterwards and pain and medication of the Vicodin. And I remember saying things that didn't make sense and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to deliver the new cabinets that my son in law was putting in my kitchen. And I remember asking him, I had just taken vitamin. And I remember asking him, now, who are you?And I knew very well who he was. And he would answer very slowly. And I thought, oh, he's trying to humor me. And I'd say, I ask you these stupid questions. And I was praying, and I said, now, let me I could hear myself say, now let me write this down.And so in in due course, about 3 hours later, these men showed up and I was back, sort of, and I said, they come in.

And they had not a seminar, but they called it a university. And it was like a week long, and it would always be one would be in the United States, and the second one of the year would be outside the United States. And this year it was going to be in San Francisco, and it'll be 20 years ago next month. And my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening, and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a lot of the background work and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week.And so Don stayed here and my sister from Dallas flew in, and that was the week that they had the San Francisco earthquake. And so we were at Fisherman's Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free, and we were waiting to go on the trolley car back to St. Francis, the western St. Francis. And as we're waiting in line, the earthquake hit.And it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that. And so my sister, just being the big sister, she always tried to calm me down, and she said that was probably a two or three. And how she came up with that, I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake, so we didn't know. But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off, so nothing worked.And so we walked 18 blocks back to our hotel, and in San Francisco, you know, it's pretty mean. It was quite a jump back there, and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel. So we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was we were concerned about Mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there, and we wanted to also call our two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called Mother, who never watches news.She doesn't like to hear the bad news, and there's hardly any good news that's told. So we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know, but my sister said, Mother, what are you doing? And she said, Well, I'm watching the news because so and so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco. So it was a lot of fear at the beginning.We were on the 19th floor, so we had to walk up to the 19th floor and then walk down with our luggage. So it was just the fear of the unknown."

So then there was to be a dance where the prince was going to maybe find a mate to marry. So the two stepdaughters two stepsisters were planning to go to the dance. The whole countryside was invited to this dance where the prince would be looking for a wife.And Cinderella was kept busy doing work around the house.

        "transcript": "And the first one was, I guess every new mother is nervous. I wasn't nervous to have a baby, except that she came so fast and when she came on her due date, which is precisely who she is, and I got to the hospital and was already at like eight or something, so there were very few options for me except to just have the baby. And I did. And I just remember her coming out and looking like this little Manchichi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And she was so brown, her hair was so brown and she had this brown hair all over, and I have light hair and her dad has light hair, so it was just pretty incredible to see this little baby with all this brown hair.Anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just don't it doesn't go away. I remember what I was wearing when I got there. I remember where I was sitting in the car. I remember the stoplights we went through. I remember the path to the hospital.I remember everything about it. And then bringing her home. Nothing was the same ever again. So it's like I remember every detail. And then my whole world just she was always there then, and then it was like she was never not there.And then her brother I was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have Grace because she, like I said, came so fast. And when I got to the hospital, there was nothing to do except have this baby. And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember my gynecologist know you had a very quick first born. This is going to happen again. And I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks.And all I could think was, when is this going to happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain going to come back? And that's not how it worked at all. Actually. He was also born on his due date, so now we've determined it's me who has to have things in the right place.But we rode to the hospital. I checked myself in. It was so calm. It was the exact opposite. And he came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face.And I just remember thinking, there are so many times when people say no two kids are alike, or boy, girl, two boys, two girls, doesn't matter. They were completely different. They are still completely different, but they are the best things I have. I look at my life and that's it. It's them.So that's, I guess, my most important story in two parts. I'm going to show you these pictures. Take a little time to look through these pictures. They do tell a story. So again, take a look at all of them and then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay? And you may begin when ready.So Jack was out in his front yard practicing for a soccer game that was coming up."

Well, one day she was looking out at the hill, and she saw the beautiful castle up on the hill, and she dreamed about what it would be like to live in a castle someday. But she had to go back to all her work. More cooking, more cleaning. But she was such a nice and gentle person that all the animals loved her and flocked to her.All the mice and the horses and the dogs and the cats. Everyone loved her so much. Well, up at the castle, there was a prince. And the king, who was the prince's father, decided it was time for the prince to get married. So he and his advisors decided to have a ball for the prince to meet all the eligible women in the kingdom so he could pick his bride.So they sent out invitations to the whole country for everyone with eligible brides or girls to come to the ball. Cinderella's house got an invitation, too. And everybody was so excited. Both stepsisters thought it would just for sure be her that the prince would choose. So they used Cinderella to help them get ready, get their dresses, get everything ready.And Cinderella wanted to go, too, but she didn't have time to get herself ready. So the animals got ready for her. They made her a dress and did her hair and got her all ready to go. And she ran downstairs to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go. She said that only girls, only the stepsisters could go.And she ripped Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was so upset, she went back to her room and she cried and she cried, and lo and behold, what appeared. But her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother said, cinderella, you can go to the ball. And she used magic to make her a new dress and to turn the mice into footman and to turn the pumpkin into a carriage. And off she went to the ball in the brand new dress that the fairy godmother had made by magic.For her, especially important was she was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet. So she went to the ball, and the minute she entered the ball, the prince had eyes for no one but Cinderella. And they danced, and they danced, and they danced, and they had a wonderful time. But then the clock struck midnight, and the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight. So the clock started striking midnight, and Cinderella had to run before the prince saw that she wasn't really a princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella.She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away. But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home and the Prince was sad, but he knew he had her glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside for whose ever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fit it would become his bride. And they went around and no one's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to Cinderella's house.Both stepsisters tried, but their feet wouldn't fit. Finally, they tried it on Cinderella and her foot fit perfectly. And she and the Prince got married and lived happily ever after. The end. And I keep talking.Can you tell me how you'd make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Well, being the methodical OCD person that I am, first I get everything out on my counter. I get out the bread, I get out the peanut butter, I get out the jelly. Or in my case, I used grape jelly.And I get out a knife. Two knives at a plate."

He's vomiting mostly in the morning. In fall of 2010, he went on antibiotics, got a little bit better, so we thought everything was okay. After a week or so, it started to go badly again. We took him back to the pediatrician, who ordered a CT scan of his sinuses, but also just, he said, kind of as a throwaway, like defensive medicine, almost always get a CT of his whole head.So I took him to Bloomington Hospital for the CT.On the way, we were listening to Judas Priest and he asked me if that was Iron Maiden, which seems silly, but it was the first time he recognized the style of music, which was the new wave of Bread of Sheavy metal and the operatic vocals that are consistent between the two of them. So that was awesome. We get into the CT scan. He does it. The phone rings out in the waiting room, and it's the radiologist.And first he says, who is this? And I tell him, I didn't mean to talk to you. He was trying to call the pediatrician and inadvertently actually got me. It was clear that he didn't want to break in retrospect, it was clear that he didn't want to break the news. Pediatrician called back and then said that they'd found a three and a half centimeter tumor in the back of his head and that he should go to Riley the next day.And about, I don't know, less than 30 minutes later, he called back and said, I spoke to the surgeon at Riley. He wants to see him now. So we just had to pack up stuff, take him to Riley. He underwent brain surgery. The next were prior to brain surgery for cancer.They took us out for the consent and the residents telling me about this potential complication called posterior fossil mutism, which is a rare complication based on the location of the tumor, and that in rare cases, it meant that he wouldn't be able to speak for a little while afterward, which is funny. Not funny. I mean, he has to get consent, but what choice do you have? Well, I don't want him to not have to speak for a little while, so I'm just going to let him have cancer in his brain. It'll be fine.What could go wrong? So he does it. What I learned was that posterior fossil mutism is just kind of an old, archaic, almost way of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior fossil mutism, posterior fossil syndrome, which is more the mutism."

        "transcript": "Cinderella's father married for the second time when Cinderella's mother had died and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters. And then he himself died, leaving her in the care of this woman, who treated her as the family and made her clean the fireplaces, hence the name Cinderella. And do other menial work? At some point the prince of the whatever principality it was, was in need of a wife, said his father and the, I don't know, minister of whatever marriages. So they cooked up a scheme to have a ball and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality.Cinderella got one, but she, of course, did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation. But then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach, with white horses and a footman and so forth. So she was able to go to the ball, but the provision was that she must, must leave at midnight. She went to the ball and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated. And the Prince danced with her and basically fell in love.Midnight came and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she had to be out of there. So she hurried away and in her hurrying she lost one slipper, which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her. She was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth. But she managed to get home anyway. And later the Prince was very depressed.He had fallen in love with this woman and she had disappeared. All he had left was a glass slipper and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else. So his father, who I guess was the king and the Minister of Marriages, went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on. And of course, it would not fit anyone at all, including the two unpleasant stepsisters, even though I believe in one story, one of them cut off a toe in order to fit, try to fit in, but it still didn't work and it got blood all over the place. But finally, the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper with Cinderella.And of course she was just a slady, but he insisted that she try it on."

        "transcript": "I work, I'm an educational aide in a special needs preschool classroom. So I deal with three, four, and five year olds that have delays in either physical behavior. Speech is one of the big ones. I have 22 kids and probably 16 of them have speech delays of some kind. The majority of them are language delays and we work with them a lot.So I work for these kids every day. We have a licensed speech therapist that comes in once a week and teaches a lesson and then we follow up on whatever she wants us to do the rest of the week. So our language kids, we really work hard with them on questions, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, on, off, under, over. And that's a lot of just talking to them and using the correct language and getting them to mimic what we want them to say so it just becomes natural and wrote with them. We have our severe kids with speech delays, which are their phonetics.Their sounds wouldn't call them severe. They're in the middle. So we work a lot with stopping them every time they're saying something incorrectly and prompting them to do either modeling or prompting them to say the correct thing, the right sound, and doing a lot of the tongue up, mouth open, back in your throat sound. And then our severe cases are we have two children with autism and one child that was born addicted to crack and the boy that was born addicted to one of the autistic kids aren't typical autistic kids. They're very low verbal kids.So we're just working with them on environmental sounds and becoming aware that I'm in their space and part of their world and to associate sounds and communication as a way to get me to do something for them. We're working a lot on recognizing that a sound means me and a sound means them.Our crack baby, that's not a good way, but that's what I'll call him because I'm not going to use his name. But he has physical issues too. He's a drooler, so we work with him a lot on physically reminding him shut his mouth and focus. And there's a lot of rote work with him also, but there's a lot of trying to get him to mentally focus on it's. A lot of just rote training and repetition and over and over and over.And sometimes we see results and sometimes it takes forever and we don't see anything. But that's how it is. Can you tell me okay, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid, or more recently, the same story or the different story from what you told last week? Just make sure if it's the same story, you tell it as if I've never heard, I'm going to tell you a different story.Okay. About 1999, I took my kids sledding up in Troy, Ohio, which is just north of here. My son was five and my daughter was three, so my husband went two and we were sledding and we were having a good time on the levee, which is a small hill, but just about right for a five year old."

        "transcript": "Okay, I will say most recently my mom has developed Parkinson's disease. And at first she's been fine through it all and it's not like she has tremors like Michael J. Fox, she kind of has like the bobbing of the head and whatnot and very emotional, which she never was before. So it's kind of like you never know if you say, I think it's going to rain today, if that will make her cry or not. So what I have found with her, whereas she doesn't live in my same town, so we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything.And without physically seeing her face, I have to start the conversation slow and see where she's at in her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues or if this conversation will just be about nothing. So I've had to do a lot more listening to her and listening to the cues versus normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, oh my gosh, this happened today and you just start rambling. But I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her now, so she takes it all to heart. So for me, I've really had to kind of let go of part of our relationship because I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's going to upset her or not. And it's sad.So getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody because she doesn't do FaceTime or anything, which to me that would be a clear indication I can read her face a lot better. So asking the right questions and just listening a lot more. I'd like you to think about something important that happened in your life and I would like you to tell me a story about this event. It can be happy or sad from childhood up to now, anything that stands out in your mind that you would like to tell a story about.Okay, I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy. So I really don't go to the doctors, I don't like to go to doctors. And that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I didn't read a lot about it.I just went through it because I was fine the whole way. And then when we got to the hospital, I had to be induced. I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know what I was signing up for. But when we walked into that hospital, I got panicked because I didn't know anything.And my mom was there. She came up and she saw my doctor. And I remember the first thing she said. She goes, Your doctor is as old as you are. And she was she was only like a couple of years older than me.But I really didn't think anything about it. And then I started getting nervous. I thought, well, I wonder how many babies she still."

And the Evil Queen goes up to the mirror and says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still snow white. That hasn't changed.And so the Evil Queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger for productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do because that seems like a very narrow minded and not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror. Anyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point the queen says to herself, well, I guess I can't do anything.Gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so dang lonely. And she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life, she's wishing for the one she loves, even though I'm not sure she has a true grasp of what that would actually entail. But basically one day she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet. She's kind of creepy.He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself, I'm wishing, I'm wishing for the one I love today. And then creepy prince comes in and goes today out of nowhere. And it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet.But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life and she's terrified, rightly? And so the prince goes away and she goes back to her lonely life. And this is the point at which the queen is like, well, clearly I need to kill her. This is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this huntsman and says, huntsman, you're going to kill Snow White.You're going to bring me her heart as proof. I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like Snow White. It's not like Snow White has a sewn on label that says Property of Snow White on her heart. But that's not the point. The queen is clearly a little bit few fries short of a Happy Meal.So the huntsman goes out and he chases Snow White a little bit through the woods. And then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure, he could never kill her. And so he falls to his knees in supplication and he says, I'm so sorry. And he drops the knife and Snow White's like and then he says, run away and I will cover for you, but you better run away and never come back because the queen is going to kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest.And he brings the heart of a wild boar to the queen and says, Look, Queen, this is Snow White's heart. Heart of a wild boar. Doesn't look like a human heart. The Queen is stupid, basically. And the Queen says, Ah, yes, cook that into a meal for me.And then she proceeds to eat this boreheart, thinking that it's Snow White's, which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids. I don't know about you. So Snow White has fled into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her, and she's making weird faces again.And eventually she makes it to this cottage where she breaks in. Breaking in ring also a common theme in these stories. She breaks in and she sees it's kind of dusty and kind of rows, but she sees all in a little row, a bunch of little beds, like for people who are maybe 3ft tall, if that. And she says, Well, I'm going to crash on one of those beds later. I guarantee it."

To beginning in the begin with and then he walked to school with umbrella.Okay.Now, take a look at this picture. Take a look at everything that's going on. And again.

So it got stuck and she yelled for it, but it would not come down. So she got her dad to try to get the cat from the tree. And while doing so, his ladder fell down and their neighbor's dog came and started barking at the tree.So the father was not able to get down. The fire station was called, and they're bringing a letter to retrieve him and the cat. Okay, Good.So now I'm going to ask you to tell a story. Have you heard of the story of Cinderella? I have. Okay, Cool. Do you remember much about it?Yeah. So these pictures might remind you of how it goes. You can take a look at the pictures in the book. And then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. So take a little time and look at it then.Whenever you're ready.So there was a girl and a father. The father met another woman that he wanted to marry who happened to have two daughters. The stepsisters were snobs and then the father died. Cinderella was left without anyone to protect her.

And she moved in with them and they were referred to as her ugly stepsisters. They were not very kind to Cinderella. They did not welcome her into the home.Cinderella had to do all the chores around the house. She was kind of like a maid and very isolated. So she made friends with all the animals around the house and learned to enjoy life that way. One day they got a notice from the royal castle that there was going to be a ball that the prince needed to find a significant other and there was going to be a royal ball. And Cinderella and the stepsisters and the mother were all very excited to go to the ball.But it turns out that Cinderella was not going to get to go to the it. The stepmother made it so that she had chores and things to do and was not going to be able to go. And she also didn't have anything to wear, so she got all of her chores done and all the animals, the mice and all the animals helped make her a dress to wear to the ball. And she got all ready to wear the dress and the ugly stepsisters tore it up and ripped all of her things off. And she didn't have anything to wear, so she wasn't going to get to go to the ball.And she was outside upset, crying because of it. And suddenly appeared a fairy godmother who used her magic wand to make Cinderella a beautiful ball gown. And she had a horse and a carriage to ride to the ball in. And she went to the royal ball and danced with the prince. And he fell in love with her.And they were having their night of romance. And suddenly she remembered that her fairy godmother told her when the clock strikes twelve, the spell would be broken, that she put on her with all and she would lose her fancy dress and then her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin and her clothes would go back to her normal raggedy clothes. And so she ran off and left the prince. But when she ran off she had on silver slippers, glass slippers, and one of them, she stepped out of one and left them on the stairway going down from the castle. And so she went back home and the spell broke and everything turned back to normal and she went on about her business, but she still had one glass slipper and then one left behind.So again the palace sent out a notice to everybody in the community that the prince was going to try to find his love. And he was going to go around to all the houses that had young women in them and have them try on the glass slipper to See If to Find His Love and See Who It Was That Left That Slipper Behind. Well, the stepmother locked Cinderella in her room. And the ugly stepmothers tried to, when the people came, buy two for the girls in that house to try on the slippers. The stepmother locked Cinderella in her room so she couldn't do it.And the Ugly Stepdaughters tried to get their feet in the shoe."

And so her mom called my mom and we realized I hadn't had chickenpox, so we knew I was going to get them. So it didn't take very long, and I got the chickenpox, and I remember feeling really weak and lethargic and I would be just on the floor. We had a room that was like a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it, and I just slept on the floor. And I wasn't experiencing any pain or terrible itching yet, but that did come.And I remember feeling my mom would create this mixture of some kind of paste that she would put on the chickenpox. And I think that it was like, I want to say like baking soda and water. It was some combination of something like that, and it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store, and she probably was not going to do that because in order to save money, but it worked. I do remember that. And I remember she would put me in the bath with that oatmeal kind of mixture, and it was very soothing.And then after the bath would put this again, this paste or this mixture on the different spots. But even though those things helped me physically feel better, the thing that I remember about when I started to feel better, like, really feel better, is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff, stickers and we had sticker books, and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers, and I focused on my sticker book instead of the chickenpox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the kind of itching and scratching, and it put me in a better mood. So I wasn't as lethargic and I got better.

Okay.So I have a teenage daughter, and I know that they say that teenagers can be difficult to communicate with in general, but she also has a personality type that is very private. And I would say she withholds communication withholds things not out of, you know, lying or any ill will or anything bad. She just only gives as much information as she thinks other people need to have, which is very frustrating as a parent, because I want to know more about what her day is like."

So why the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and were getting all ready to go to it. She got really sad. She was very sad, very sad.So the stepmom and the two stepsisters left to go to the ball.

I'll fix everything with my magic wand. Anyway, so she point her wand at Cinderella and she had this beautiful dress that peered on her beautiful shoes and her hair, and I think what that thing is tiara and everything.And then they went outside and they turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses and pumpkin carriage, everything for her to go.

And so he blithely went along his way, enjoying his wife, his two stepchildren, and every once in a while seeing his daughter, who was so sweet and didn't complain to Daddy. Meanwhile, in this kingdom that they lived so long ago and far away, the King and Queen Th decided that their oldest son needed to get married. It was time. And so they planned a great ball, which is a big, big party with lots of dancing and music and people.And they sent out a herald, that is a messenger who told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come, all the single young women, because they had to be old enough to get married to come to this big fancy party in their prettiest dresses. And so the stepmother heard about this and was very, very excited because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince. And she plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get. Meanwhile, poor Cinderella wasn't going to get to go. Her stepmother said, no, you have to help me get the girls ready and dressed.And then you have work to do. You have to keep this house clean. You have to make sure that it is thick and span when the prince comes to claim his bride. Poor Cinderella. After the girls and their stepmother left for the ball, she sat and sat and cried.She wanted to go to this fancy party also.

But what we do is, in case you don't remember everything about it, these pictures might remind you of how it goes.So I'm going to give you a chance to go through the book and look at the pictures. Then I'll put the book away, and you can tell me as much of the story as you remember in your own words.And they lived happily ever after. Okay? Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. When Cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house, and there was a stepmother, and the stepmother had two daughters.The father dies, and the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children, her two daughters, and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid. And they so to speak. So Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and all of that. And then the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes, and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella. And then comes the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for there to be a dance.And everybody is all looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the perfect outfit. And Cinderella is not going to go to the ball, and she is at home, and the sisters are all dressed and find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest.Wait a minute.I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing. So the sisters go to the ball, and poor Cinderella is home with her mice, and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance, I believe. So the fairy godmother creates the carriage to take her in, and the horsemen and everything is perfect. And her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball. So when she goes to the ball, she is the most gorgeous they are, and everyone just takes her breath away.She takes their breath away."

        "transcript": "Alright, so Cinderella starts when her father marries the evil stepmother and Cinderella is joined into this new family. And then the father mysteriously disappears for some reason, probably killed or murdered or maimed for his money, assuming that the evil stepmother is true to her evil her evil name. And then when she grows up, she is kind of like taken on as a maid for the evil stepmother and the evil stepsisters. And they all tell her to clean the floor and wash the dishes and make their food and stuff like that. And eventually one day the king of this kingdom that she lives in decides he's going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his son, the prince.The evil stepmother gets invited to the ball and she decides that it would be a great idea to have her two actual daughters go. And she schemes to have Cinderella stay behind. And Cinderella doesn't know this, so she is like mystified and she makes a dress and she gets prepared. And then when she shows up to go to the ball, the evil stepmother tears off her necklace and shreds up her clothing and says that she's not allowed to go because she's simple and she's not like one of the family. And so the evil stepmother goes with the evil stepsisters to the ball, and then Cinderella cries.And that's when her fairy godmother shows up and transforms some of her friends, her animal friends, into humans and transforms like a pumpkin into a giant chariot and gives her a magic dress and glass slippers and provides her with everything she needs for this party. And she heads out to the party in her pumpkin mobile, pulls up, hops out, stuns, everyone walks inside instantly. The prince is like, this is the future wife, and then walks over, they dance together and then the evil stepmother and stepsisters see that they're dancing and are shocked. I don't know if they recognize her, but they are shocked to see that they aren't the ones who are getting to dance with the prince. But Cinderella has to leave because her magic wears off at midnight, which is stupid, that doesn't make sense to me.If it's magic, it should just work. But she leaves, probably for a good plot point, and returns back home as herself, not in her gallant dress, but she left behind a glass slipper, which the prince finds. And the prince is mystified by her and decides that he has to go and find out who she is. So he roams the land fitting a shoe onto fair maidens, trying to figure out if they're the one who he danced with because apparently he just can't remember her face. I guess he just can only remember her shoe size.But eventually he arrives at Cinderella's house where the evil stepmother has locked her in a building. This part's from the movie, though I don't know if it was in the book. And then the animals help her get out of the room. And then she shows up downstairs when the prince is fitting the shoe onto the stepsister's feet and their feet are way too big and are squishing in. So he's disgusted.And then he sees her and kind of instantly knows it's her, but then has to put the shoe on because once again, I guess he can't just remember her face. And then shoe fits. They fall in love. And then evil stepmother."

And then as they grew up, the stepsisters made Cinderella do all the dirty chores.She had to clean the floors, had to clean the chimney, everything like that. So she was not happy, but she did her job. She wanted to keep her dad happy because he had already lost one wife. So one day in the castle, the king was talking to his right hand man and told him that he wanted his son to get married so he would have an heir to the throne. So the right hand man, which I can't remember the title for, I'm just calling the right hand man, went to all the houses in the village and gave them an invitation to a grand ball for all the people, all the girls eligible bacheloretes, to go to the ball, of course, being escorted by their parents.Well, Cinderella read the letter over her stepmother's shoulder and got excited because she thought, wow, I can go and I can be part of this thing. Well, her stepsisters didn't exactly like that. So Cinderella went and got it started to make a dress. She had the mice that were making dresses for her because hers wasn't very pretty and she wanted a pretty dress. So they made her a pretty dress.And the night of the ball came and she put on her pretty dress and went to where her stepmother and her stepsisters were waiting. And they were not happy. The stepsisters were not happy that Cinderella was even thinking about going. So they ripped her dress and ripped her necklace, took her, messed up her hair and said, you can't go. So after that, Cinderella went out into the garden and she was crying because she really wanted to go and she felt betrayed.So all of a sudden, up pops her fairy godmother.

So everybody was watching her dancing with him. But she remembered the one thing her fairy godmother told her she had to be home by the twelveTH stroke of mid."

        "transcript": "Okay. When Cinderella was a child, her father had remarried after her mother had passed away, and her new stepmother and two stepsisters moved in with them. As they got older, the stepsisters became meaner and meaner to Cinderella, making her do all the household chores and doing everything for them. Cinderella had no life of her own, so spent a lot of time with all the farm animals, telling them stories of how she would like to meet Prince Charming. Then one day, it was announced that Prince Charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife.So Cinderella got exciting, saying she would go to the ball and make a beautiful dress and meet Prince Charming. At the same time, the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball, also talking of how they would marry Prince Charming and live a wonderful life with him, too. So the night of the ball, cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made, put on some jewelry, and did her hair and was walking out when the stepsisters said, where do you think you're going? And Cinderella says, I'm going to the ball. And they ripped her dress to pieces and tore her jewelry off and messed up her hair so she couldn't go to the ball as they left and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her, cinderella was so upset that she couldn't go to the ball any longer, and she sat outside and cried.All of a sudden, the fairy godmother came along and said, what are you crying for? And she said, I can no longer go to the ball. My dress is all torn, and I have nothing else to wear. And the fairy godmother said, oh, dear, let me take care of that for you. And with the wave of her wand, she gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo, and she has some beautiful glass slippers.And Cinderella said, thank you, Fairy Godmother. But now how will I get there? And so the fairy godmother says, well, here's a coach for you to take you to the ball, but you have to leave at midnight or it'll turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella says, oh, no problem. I'll be home by midnight.Thank you so much. So off to the ball she goes, in her carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers. Cinderella gets to the ball and is in awe of how beautiful it is, and she sees Prince Charming. And Prince Charming sees her immediately and comes over to her and asks her to dance. And so they dance for hours, and then Cinderella hears the clock strike midnight, and she gets worried and says, oh, no, I have to leave.And she immediately runs out the door. And as she's running to the carriage, she loses one of her slippers and doesn't have time to go grab it. So she jumps in the carriage, and carriage takes her off into the distance, leaving Prince Charming to wonder who the beautiful woman was. So when Cinderella's home, all she can dream about is her night at the ball and how wonderful it was. And in the meantime, Prince Charming is wondering who this beautiful woman was and how he's going to find her, and realizes he can take the glass slipper and find out who it fits.And that will be his girl. So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on all the women to see if he can find her for him when he gets to Cinderella's house. His stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try the slipper on all the women. So they're convinced that one of them will fit into the slipper.When the man comes into the house and the shoe doesn't fit the two stepsisters, he sees Cinderella and says, you haven't tried the shoe on yet. And the stepmother."

        "transcript": "So we moved out to Michigan as a very young couple and shortly afterwards I found out I was pregnant with our first child. And oh my gosh, it was so exciting. I felt so healthy for nine months. I did have two fears was health fears but fortunately neither of those came true. Great pregnancy got up.I went to work every day. Due date was January 18 and first baby, the baby was not born. We did not find out the sex and even back then you could I wanted to be totally surprised. I love surprises. So on January 18 I had still not had the baby and had a scheduled checkup with the OB doctor and assumed it would be my last visit.Anyway, went in after work. My husband met me because first child he was at all the appointments and I am like, well before I moved to Florida, very fair and tall and fair tall and what was the other thing? Never like a muscular kind of person. So anyway, the whole time I'm carrying this baby, which by the way first baby, this baby barely moved and I had comparatively to the second, I had nothing. I thought it was fine because what did I know?Nothing. And every time I would push my stomach I would say, oh, she because my mother had three girls and my other sister had three girls and my other sister had a girl. So I would say, oh, she's going to have a really firm butt. This is wonderful. So last visit, last checkup, he does an internal and he's like, why don't we go across the hall?I want to do a scan or I don't know what they called it at the time. And he says yes. He goes, just what I thought. And I was like, Because I'm cloud. Like it was just such an exciting time because the baby is not in position so you're going to have a C section.And I was like a C section. That was one of my two secret fears of having a baby. I was like, absolutely not. You can flip this baby. You can do this.You can do that. He's like your first pregnancy. We really don't know why the baby didn't drop. I guess that was another thing on the image. He couldn't see the cord or he said a little bit, we don't really know how long the cord is.He gave me every reason this baby was not going to be flipped. So there's lots of things out there. Andrea. This was a Thursday. January 18.I should look to see if I'm correct in my memory and went home that night. There was no internet but like folklore, like upside down, leaning on an ironing board, flashlight between your legs, all this kooky kooky stuff. But anyway, monday. It was a Thursday. Monday I was scheduled for my C section.So on Friday I went for all my blood work. That was the only day I missed at work. I worked a full day on Thursday, missed Friday, and the baby was scheduled to be born on Monday. And Sunday night I went to bed and my water broke. And I was so excited because then I felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready.It's not like a C section, like, just ripping this baby out. So I was, like, all excited. And we were in Michigan by ourselves, so I didn't wake up my husband. I decided to go get my bag, and I got everything ready by the door before I woke him up. And I showered I shaved my legs.And now the contractions are getting worse. And I could not find the list of people he had to call."

Or you try to speak as clearly as you can, but they still don't understand even that much English, try to simplify it and they still don't understand it. Or they don't understand your accent, or if they repeat it back to you don't quite get it, what they're trying to say. When I was younger, my brother and I liked to go to my neighbor's house and he had a pack of Dobermans and we would tease the dogs because they were fenced in and we would go on our way. It was nothing, it was nothing.We didn't abuse the dogs, we would just mess with them and then we would go on our way home and inevitably the dogs would always get out and we'd literally have to run for our lives with a pack of Dobermans on our heels. And I was afraid of dogs pretty much my whole life until about 2000 because I had images of dogs chasing me for dear life, but they never did catch catch us and they never hurt us, but still I was afraid of dogs. This young girl has been caught in a floodwater or a raging river and someone saw this, called for help, help did arrive and he is in the process this fireman or rescue worker is in the process of trying to get her out of the water and take them both to safety. A young boy is playing soccer outside. He accidentally kicks a ball through a window and the ball knocks over a lamp.And there's a guy in that house who picks up the ball pretty surprised, and looks out, trying to figure out who kicked the ball or where it came from. There's a mom waiting by the door to say goodbye to her son and give him an umbrella. But the son decides he doesn't need the umbrella and leaves the house. He gets outside, he sees that it's raining. He walks on a little bit until it starts pouring.Then he goes back home. The mom is quite upset, he's drenched. He finally gets the umbrella, leaves and walks happily into the rain. Cinderella's dad introduces Cinderella to his new wife, who looks very unpleasant, and her two little daughters.And there's also a pet cat and a very sweet dog. Cinderella grows up to be a servant in the house. And her stepsisters grow up as well. Only they're not as beautiful as Cinderella is. Cinderella works around the house.She's working in the stables in the shadow of the castle.One day, Cinderella's stepmom gets an invitation to the castle. There's going to be a party. Cinderella makes a really beautiful dress and she gets ready and she's ready to go with them. But the stepmom encourages her daughters, who aren't very pretty, to destroy Cinderella's dress. And now she can't go to the ball either her.And then, incredibly, there's a fairy godmother who fixes Cinderella's dress, who gives her a carriage with horses and a really beautiful dress.

        "transcript": "It's all childhood stuff. That's okay. Yeah, go ahead. All right. Now we're going to middle school, where I was in homet class, and it was time to learn to sew.So I was sewing on a jacket with a little tiny one, eight seam, and as I was moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the a needle, and it does that, and I yanked it, so the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer, and he said he was going to pull it out, and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital, and they had to remove my fingernail and slice my finger open, take out the needle, and then X ray because they had little splinters of metal in there, x ray that and then sew it back up. And I had a huge Band Aid.And unfortunately, like, two days later, it was the middle school dance, and I was embarrassed because I had a new dress, and I had this great big old bandage. What helped me get over it, I think it was just time. Just time.I have more injuries. Thank you so much. Just one more for the road. That was great. Thank you so much for sharing.And, oh, my goodness. Today I do not sew. That was the end of my sewing days. And this homet teacher hasn't been retired long, and I was used. She said, here I am.Becca even had her when she was in middle school. She had to use me as an example through all of her years of teaching. So how's that?But I am curious. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? Okay, great.So in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did about it, if anything.I was special needs teacher for ten years and still go so does Bacca, for that matter. Still go to Eagleari once a year with them. And there are usually seven to eight that go, and we chaperone, and they have classes, but three of them are brothers, of which only one can speak. The others, you have to follow their hand communication. It's not that they sign language, but they try to because it's more in the grunting aspect of interesting enough, usually his mom knows what he's referring to, so I would say it's more being patient.And they eventually get their story out by pointing, by doing the same thing over. Or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you. And I think that is probably my nephew is autistic and nonverbal and pretty much it's the same thing. He just takes you by the hand and takes you to where he wants to go."

Once again she asks him, you really ought to take your umbrella with you today. No, Mom, I'm just fine.He walks out the door and starts walking to school, when all of a sudden it starts to rain. It starts raining harder and harder. He turns around, runs back and runs into the house. He's soaking wet, his hair's plastered down, his shirt is soaked, and his mom looks at him and says, now, didn't I ask you if you needed that umbrella? So he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school.Again, there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball, when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can. The ball sails quite a ways. In fact, it sails so far, it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room. When it comes through the glass after breaking the window, it even knocks over a lamp in the living room. The man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through, jumps up, grabs the ball and looks out the window.But the boys run away.There once was a young girl called Cinderella. She had three ugly stepsisters, and her family didn't like her very much and made her do all the household chores. She had to scrub and she had to clean, and she had to cook and sew and everything all by herself, while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun.One day, the prince was going to have a big ball, and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear, looking around, buying new dresses, checking out how they looked. But Cinderella couldn't go, when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says, what's wrong, Cinderella? Why are you so depressed? Cinderella says, I can't go to the ball that the prince is having, but my stepsisters get to go instead. And her fairy godmother says, well, nonsense.And she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears. And she says, well, you're going to need horses and a coach to ride. So she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage. And she gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball. But the stepmother said, the fairy godmother says, be sure you're home by midnight.The magic's only good for one day. At the stroke of midnight, all of this will disappear. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince. He just wants to dance with her all night when she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight.Oh, goodness. So she turns and races out of the ball. And in a hurry to get away, she drops one of her glass slippers, falls off of her foot, hops into her carriage, and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight, the horses change back into mice, the carriage changes back into a pumpkin, and her fancy dress gown turns into the rags that she wore in the kitchen. She sneaks into the house, and all her stepsisters were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady."

        "transcript": "It something important.Ah, I guess a lot of important things sort of happened, you know, be hard to I think in a sense I made my own important things. For instance, I grew up in a family. I was one of five children. And now, I don't want this to sound politically incorrect, but my father was Italian, of Italian descent, and he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college. And unfortunately four of us were girls, so he wasn't pleased with that either.And I was the third one. Can you imagine in a row. No boys yet. So anyhow, it was made very clear that college was not on the map. And his idea was that I've been supporting you all these years and now you owe me.You have to go to work and contribute to the household. So this was a built in thing. At the time, I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it that I'll be going to work soon. And the good news was that I was also an honor student and I got to high school at twelve.And the bad news was at 16 my education was complete and now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal. I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student, she actually wanted to call him. And I was very calm about the whole thing. I said, there's really no point, you're not going to get anywhere.This is the state of things. It's the state of the art at the Demiko household and that's that. So anyway, she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on Wall Street and who worked in a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust Company, which no longer exists. And they took great pride in that company. They were at One Wall Street and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street and this was verbalized.So anyway, she called her friend and I'll never forget her name was Mary Unru, who I went to say. So I put a suit on, went shopping and bought know, very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview. And I think I was a shoe in because her friend, the guidance counselor had called her. And so she hired me and I ended up in a sub basement. Not just a basement, it was a sub basement.I think I was lower than the vaults in a secretarial pool. Where else I could be a genius, but I was going to a secretarial pool. And good on me. I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to even though I had an academic course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study and I took typing and stenography. I thought this might help me.And maybe my job won't be so random. I have at least a specific skill rather than just a resident genius. Wherever I end up."

So as they were blending these families together, cinderella spent a lot of time with her mother. But her stepmother favored her children over Cinderella and had Cinderella do all the chores in their house. And the stepsisters didn't really have to do any chores.They were the favored ones. But Cinderella never complained. She made friends with all the animals around the house and was just a happy go lucky girl. And one day, there was going to be a big ball at the castle, and all the young maidens in the land were invited to attend the celebration. But Cinderella's stepmother said she couldn't go because she did not have a proper dress.But her stepsisters were going to go, and they had the best dresses around. And Cinderella found her trunk with a dress, but her mother said it wasn't suitable to go. So Cinderella was crying with her animal friends, and out of nowhere appeared her fairy godmother, who turned her dress into a beautiful ball gown and turned her animal friends into the carriage and the horse and the driver. So she was able to attend the ball. So she attended the ball.But her fairy godmother had one wish for her, or one statement for her, that all the dress and the carriage would expire at midnight, so she had to leave the dance before midnight. So she went to the dance and she danced with the Prince, and they had a wonderful time. And she saw the clock was getting close to being midnight, so she left in a hurry because she didn't want her gown to change back to just a plain old dress. And at that time, she accidentally lost her glass slipper. But she returned to her house and told her animal friends all about the dance and meeting the Prince.Well, unbeknownst to her, the Prince had kept the glass slipper, and he wanted to find out who the maiden was that wore that glass slipper. And so they took the glass slipper all through town to see whose foot would fit in the glass slippers. And when they came to her house, both her stepsisters tried on the slipper and it would not fit. So Cinderella came and said, may I try it on? And she did, and it fit.And her and her prince lived happily ever after.I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. First, you go to your cabinet and you take out the bread and the peanut butter. And you need two slices of bread for this sandwich, and you need a knife. And you spread the peanut butter it over one slice of the bread.And then you go in the refrigerator and get out your grape jelly and you put it on the other side of the bread and you close the two halves together and cut it diagonal."

And they grab a pearl necklace that Jasper drops and the pearls go flying on the place. And both mice pick up all the pearls and Lucifer was watching them, the cat, and they manage just to get the bead stuck on Jasper's tail and slide under the door, and they're safe.And the birds help, and the mice help, and they get the dress made up real pretty. They sing us on we can do it. We can do it. They get this song going and they get the dress made. And Cinderella comes in the attic and they surprise her with this beautiful dress.And she's so happy she can go to the ball. So she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and her stepsisters to wait because she could go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished all her chores. And the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks in her beautiful dress. And they see that the decorations are stuff that she quote unquote stole from their garbage. So they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back.And they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball. Cinderella goes running to the garden and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball. And this fairy godmother appears and does this bibity bobbity boo thing, whips up a real pretty white dress. And then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses, and she tells Cinderella to go dance with the prince, but she has to be back by midnight. The spell wore off.So Cinderella goes to the ball and she meets the prince, and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with. And she hears the clock strike midnight and she has to go. And the prince is like, but wait, but wait. I don't even know your name. And she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach, which will soon be a pumpkin.And as she's running down the stairs, one of her shoes falls off and she gets in the coach, and the coach takes her home and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin, and the horses turn back into the mice and dog footman turns back into a dog. And the next day, she's walking around in the house and she hears the Duke come to the door and says, the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride. But he doesn't know who she is, so he's going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that the Cinderella's left this maidens left behind. So he ends up going to Cinderella's house, and she hears the Duke coming to the door. She goes to her room and the stepmother locks her in her room, puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the duke into the house.The Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small. And as the mother's sitting there, the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rush get Cinderella. And again they run into the cat. But they escape the cat again. They go underneath the door and they hand the key to Cinderella and she unlocks the door.And as she's leaving, the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister. And one stepsister was too small. One's foot was too big. And as he's leaving, Cinderella runs down the stairs and says, but wait. I want to try this shoe on.And the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderella is the one the prince was dancing with."

And he kicked a soccer ball, and it went through the window and hit his dad on the knee. And his dad realized it was him and grounded him. Okay, great. Thank you.So we're just going to do again something very similar. I'd like for you to take a look at these pictures again. They tell a story. So take a look at the pictures and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, well, looks like John wanted to borrow his mom's umbrella, but his mom wouldn't let him.Or his mom tried to give him an umbrella, but he didn't accept the umbrella. And then he walked to school, and it was raining, and he got really wet, and he was upset and realized he should have listened to his mom. So the next day, he brought an umbrella to school. Okay, great. All right, and now I'd like for you to take a look at this picture again.It tells a story, so take a look and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, so a family's cat got stuck up in a tree, and the dad wanted to go up and try to get the cat, but he couldn't, so they ended up having to call the fire department to try to get the dad and the cat out of the tree. Okay, great. All right. So now, are you familiar with the story of Cinderella?Yes. Okay, so I'm going to get you to take a look at this book. This will just kind of help refresh your memory. So take a look at the pictures in this book, and when you're finished, I'm going to take the book back, and then I'm going to have you tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay?Okay, I think I got it. All right, so Cinderella was, I think, adopted and brought into a family. She had two stepsisters and a mom. She was really mistreated. She was basically treated like the house slave or whatever.She'd do everything for him. So she developed relationships like the animals and stuff around their property or whatever. And then eventually she meets this fairy godmother that grants her wish to go to this ball or something of that sort. And she meets a prince and has, like, a great night with him and everything and loses one of her slippers. And then at the end of the story, the prince comes back with the slippers, and the two evil stepsisters are trying to pretend, like, think, oh, my slipper might fit me.But then it ends up fitting Cinderella, and basically your dreams come true. Okay, great. All right, so we have one more thing. It's going to be a little bit different. So I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.I would get out the bread first."

        "transcript": "And my husband said, surely you haven't put something into my back. It's not right. And so the doctor came in at that time, and I said, he's afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity. So he goes out and gets the head nurse, and she comes up, does another she goes and cleanse it out again, which she said, I don't like doing this twice so soon, but I feel like I should. Well, the 11th day, I was at work, and they called me and they told me that he told me that he was shaking the bed, he was jerking.So well, he said, Get him to the hospital. I called the doctor, and he said, Get him to the hospital. And the bacteria we ran into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office, and she smelled at the area. She said it's back. So there they had killed all of those blood cells in there.No hope. So he had to wear a tube. They said it'd be in there for years, and it'd be there the rest of his life. And so this goes on for eight years. I had to change the bandage and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet.And it was very painful at first. I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time, to get the catheter. And all changed because it was a procedure that had to be done in the hospital. Well, my daughter was a nurse, and she kept wanting me to go to the VA because he was a veteran and get the things over there. And they had a Bacteria committee over there that might be able to help him.So we go over there, and while we were in this office, there was this cabinet there that had tape, silk tape in it, and it was wide. And so I asked the nurse, I said, Where do you get that wide tape? I said, I can only find the narrow, and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged. We were paying over 200 or close to $300 at that time, a month for his supplies. And she said, you can have anything you want.Well, the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was procedure, that he knew I could do it, but he wouldn't give it to me because it was a procedure done in hospital. So when she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her what size of catheter I wanted, sterilized pins and the solution to irrigate with and everything that he needed and sterilized gloves and all. So I go home, and the first time it needed to be irrigated, I do it myself. Well, after I got through, I sat there, couldn't get up, because I thought if that pin that went down into his cavity, they'd have to do surgery to go in there to get that tube out.I was scared to death. But he said I did much better job than they did in the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through them to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity.And that way I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He weighed 200 and some pounds, and then he went down to 126. When he went left the hospital and he came back up, nobody knew that he was sick. And the doctor said that he couldn't have lived if it hadn't been for me.He wanted to have the the doctor said the only thing that they could do is go in there, clean that cavity out and put in marbles in there to make that build it up to where he'd have more stability. And I says no."

We're living there for a while, and I was staying at a friend's house in Miramaram, which is about 45 minutes away, and driving back to Marl Plata to do the business and then going back to the other seaside. So at least a week, but it may have been more, but at least I did it until they saw this guy coming every day. What's he doing?Oh, he's selling the ticket. No wonder we don't get such a long line. He's taking the business. Okay, I have one more that's very similar. Again, if you'll look through these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.So this goes back to a time when my brother Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's house. Now a little bit about our neighbor. He was a bachelor gentleman. He was very nice, but he did not want us playing ball in our backyard, which was very close to his house. So what was supposed to happen, and I told know, one day one of us is going to kick the ball into our neighbor's window.His name was Mortimer. So we're going to kick the ball into Mortimer's window. We're going to be in trouble. He said, no, we shouldn't worry about that. Okay.It went with it until the day came when Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's Mortimer's window. So it went on into the house. Not only did it break the window, it also knocked over a lamp that Mr. Mortimer had told us was a very dear object in his house. It had a history of family inheritance and heirloom that I can't quite remember.But I do remember how much he appreciated the lamp. So we were both frozen when we saw Mortimer look through the hole that Sam had just put in the window. And I can't tell you what the consequences were, but I do remember that we had a very hard time after that incident.Thank you very much. Excellent. I could have gone on for 50 consequences. And then the suit went a higher court, and then we hired a different lawyer. Good restraint, because I have so many other tasks for you.Okay, here's a similar task. Please look through these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. I remember my aunt Charlote. My Aunt Charlote was a very wicked person.I did not like her at all. And I remember staying in her house one day. For some reason, we weren't allowed to stay at home because the painters had just finished painting and they didn't want us to sleep where there was paint, fresh paint, smell around. So I stayed at Aunt Charlote. Well, lo and behold, the next day it turned out that it was a rainy day, so I'm going to go to school, which was a much longer walk from Aunt Charlote's house than it was from my house.And it was raining. So I said, hey, Aunt Charlote, can I please borrow your umbrella? And guess what she said no. Which I knew she was going to say, no because that's how wicked she was. So I went out in the rain and eventually realized that I was going to get the flu.We did not have coronavirus in those."

        "transcript": "Great. After that horrible rotator cuff thing. Let's see. Oh, gosh, I'm going to just go with that and try I don't know, I hate to pain you with such a okay, here we go.Okay, so ten years ago in July, I had a right rotator cuff repair, surgery three. And it was going to be a little bit more involved that there was a growth somewhere up there, so he couldn't do it endoscopically, so I knew it was going to be open. Shoulder surgery went in, and the slight tear in the rotator cuff at that point, from the time of the MRI to the surgery, went from a slight tear to a full tear. He also saw for the first time that my bicep was fully torn and that the nickel size growth apparently now is the size of golf ball. So he graft bone from, I don't know, collarbone area.And the bottom line is he was from this area, he was all the way down bicep area, and that was that. It was supposed to be a day surgery. Later that evening, the nurse came in, monitored me, monitored me, and I had horrible pain all night. And then eventually around, I don't know, three or four in the morning, I really don't know what time she came in, and she jabbed my thigh with a thing of morphine and knocked me out. Finally, she had done that at midnight.And I forgot a really important point. Earlier in the evening, the evening nurse came in and rubbed my arm. Here, can you feel this? Can you feel this? Yes.And then when she got to like mid forearm, can you feel this all the way down in my hand? I said no. And she says, oh, no worries. Sometimes the block takes up to 24 hours to wear off. But I was kind of like kind of sort of freaked out about it, but anyway but I didn't know any better.So into the bad night morphine around three, four in the morning. And then the surgeon came in for his rounds early in the morning, like around six ish. I heard you had a horrible night. I said, yes, and I was supposed to be day surgery. Well, you're going to have to go home soon.It's only going to get worse, he said, so I'd be happy to give you another block. But I have to tell you, there's a 50 50 chance if they give you another block, you could lose feeling in your fingers forever. And I remember just being like, I've never heard this before anyway, so I didn't want it, but I was already starting to be in a lot of pain, and I only had had the morphine had only been, I don't know, no more than 4 hours old. So I was panicked. I said, Let me think about it.He said, you think about it, but I'm going to go around, do the rest of the floor come back to you. You have to have your answer by the time I come back. So I said, all right. As soon as he left, I was like, I can't chance it. And I was afraid to fall asleep.Bruce was coming. He was dropping the kids off in high school at that .1 of them was. So he was there by 745 in the morning, told him the same story I just told you, and I said, I don't want to risk having the second block. So I didn't. And there was a wonderful male nurse on that day for the morning shift, and he medicated me as much as he could with the orders, the standing orders, to make it to day surgery and get me through.Ended up being released around four. That was there was a lot of EEG and all sorts of tests and second and third opinions. Boston and York, they all said, Surgeon error. Meantime, I had done PT. I started OT I, which was a little bit dicey, because when a surgeon gives you PT orders, they typically refer you to the PT place they own, so therefore, those people are somewhat."

        "transcript": "So I ended up in a secretarial pool. And banks are notoriously very frugal. And back then things were even worse. And the Irving, as they called themselves, were a very conservative organization and I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved. So if somebody in the upper floor is above sea level, needed some help for a day or however long, they would call down to the trenches where I was.So I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in. It was sort of like I could imagine Little Orphan Annie at the or being at any orphanage where a call comes in and they pick you.A call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the 12th floor, he was a senior vice president of the bank secretary was unexpectedly out and they needed a fill in. So they selected me. Off I went and I walked in and you could hear a pin drop in this place. I could tell it was going to be I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of light heartedness. It was almost as though they should have had a font of holy water and you should genuflect before you to sit down at your desk.So there I am and it turned out that his secretary I'll fast forward a little. So here I was. My skills are good. I'm answering the phone. I'm taking shorthand letters.Things are getting things are humming along. Everything is great. And it turns out that the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back. She was pregnant and was having some difficulties, some complications. So the absence was going to be long term.And they hired me and I had a raise right away. I thought, this work. Life is a cinch. I'm here for a week and I got a raise.I got out of the sub basement. I'm in the light of day. Things were moving along so quickly that I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall Street. There's a trajectory I was on. So one day I was there for about three months, I guess, and I was out to lunch still trying know, explore the area.It's a very exciting know wall street. And I found the New York Stock Exchange and I was sort of like a pseudo tourist. So I was walking up Broadway one day and I encounter the Marine Midland Bank, a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube, huge. Went up a few stories and I thought, this looks like a much more light hearted place to work than the Irving. It was a great place.Light and airy, modern. I went in and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was. So I was directed there. I sat down, filled out an application, and I was drunk with power by then because I had gotten a raise. Things were moving so quickly.So I filled out the application. The interview with the personnel manager went very well. She told me about three different types of positions I could have and visited all three of them, and I could pick whichever one I wanted. So I picked the one in the international department. That sounded really interesting to me."

So when mom leaves, Carl immediately goes to the window and looks out to see and also to make sure she's gone. Then Carl goes over to the crib and stands upright so the little boy can climb over the crib and right onto Carl's back.Now we're having some fun. The little boy rides to Carl and they go into mom and Daddy's bedroom and they both well, really it's Carl who jumps up on the bed. The baby goes with him.

Now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank. I don't have to tell you what happens. Next thing we see, the little boy is in the fish tank and Carl, with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt, the back of his shirt and pulls him out.Well, safe again. Now we have him all dried off. And Carl goes into the room with the stereo and he starts playing, turns it on, chooses some music, and he starts dancing. So Carl is dancing in the middle of the rug in his hind legs. And the little boy is just thrilled.He ceases and he just giggles and laughs and he can't quite dance yet, but he really loves to watch the dog dance. Uh oh. We've gone to the kitchen. Carl has managed to open the refrigerator door, and the little boy is really interested."

        "transcript": "Okay. I would say my injury is my knee injury, and started high school football, went between Garden Center and got caught and bummed my knee out as a sophomore in high school. The track coach was ed because I couldn't run track the next year, and I had just broken a city record in the quarter mile. So he wasn't happy. So did that right after the injury.I'm thinking it was in March, maybe April. I had my first surgery, and then I've had two other arthroscope surgeries since then, and then all topped off by in May of 84 or May of 84? No, May of 2017. I had a total knee replacement. And it did okay.It got me better, but it didn't get me back to normal. So I'm still fighting with knee pain and not having fun. And that's my story. I know last week you did share that you've had experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. Just describe to me what the problems were and what you did about it.Again, this can be the same example you chose last week, or it can be a different one. I have to think of this a little bit. I would say I'm going to change stories on you this week. I've got a good friend. His name is Jorge.He's Mexican, and he and I worked together at a company called Netsolve. And what we did was it was remote diagnostics of router trouble, network trouble, and Jorge was great that he could talk to Spanish speaking customers, wonderfully, but when it would come over to an English speaking customer, he definitely had a problem. He didn't have terrible problems, but it was hard trying to get him to recognize that he wasn't saying things right, and it was hard getting him to understand what I was saying sometimes. So we got to the point where I joked with him about some of the ways he would say things like he would have a piece of paper instead of a piece of paper, and then it was just, Jorge, you sound like this. And he was totally shocked because he didn't know he sounded like that.And he says, JB, you are the first person that's ever told me that I'm saying that stuff wrong. So that felt good that I was able to help him and I was able to learn about his communications because he helped me. I had high school Spanish that's been a few years ago, but he helped me understand some phrases, and in fact, he actually helped my daughter with her. She went on a what do you call it? It's not an immersion in Mexico.And when she came back, we had Jorge and his wife over for dinner, and they talked Spanish the whole time, so I couldn't understand what they were saying. But Bonnie, my daughter, could definitely do."

Well, sadly, the father died, leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two her two half sisters or two sisters. The stepmother was not happy about this, and she did not see Cinderella as her own. So she made her more of a house servant than a daughter. And she made her wait on her two daughters and clean house and take care of them.Cinderella was not happy about this, but she felt like that was her destiny. So she cleaned and cooked and did everything that she was told to do. Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart. She made friends with the animals. They were her only friends.She was so busy, she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends.Cinderella's gentle heart would carry her a long let's back up a little bit. I am thinking about the pictures in the book.On the other side of the town was a castle, and the town was ruled by a king. This king had a son, and the son was of age. To be married, they needed a new heir to the throne, and if he wasn't married, he could not become king. So the king decided to throw a ball, inviting all eligible young women, so he would have a large number to pick from for his future bride.The invitations were delivered, and certainly the stepsisters were invited. In fact, every young eligible woman was invited. Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation, but the stepmother was not about to let her go. So she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives, once in a lifetime opportunity. But she was unable to go.So off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball. And Cinderella stayed at home, very sad, very lonely, when suddenly some magical event appeared occurred. And her very godmother appeared and said, do not cry. You can go to the ball. And Cinderella was very concerned about her dress, and the stepmother instantly created a dress for her and turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice into horses.And Cinderella was ready to go to the ball. But one warning she was giving was, if you don't return before midnight, everything, all the magic, wears off, your dress will become racks again, and your carriage will become a pumpkin again. She said, don't worry, stepmother very godmother, I will. So she goes to the ball, has a wonderful time dancing with the prince, and he's entirely taken with her. No one knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way.The stepsisters didn't even recognize her.Well, it's getting close to midnight."

She becomes this actually their maid and housekeeper and has to attend to their needs and the needs of the household. And evidently, Father was of no help in mediating any of this. So the girl ends up being in the household, but being rather a member of the household, being a servant. As I said, one day a ball is announced.She lives in, I guess, a principality headed by royalty and one day a ball is announced. If I recall correctly, it's because the prince is in need of finding a wife. His father tells him that it's time for him to marry. So a ball is organized, and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend. And the three stepsisters and their mother plan to go.And they get their gowns ready. And Cinderella has to help them with that, too. But it turns out that she's not going to be allowed to go. She, of course is very sad about that. Enter her fairy godmother.They go off to the ball. The stepsisters and stepmother go up to the ball. Fairy godmother Arrives On The Scene and Says To Cinderella, you're going to go too, and we're going To Get You There by Turning This Pumpkin Into A coach and These mice Into Coachmen. And I guess the mice, too, become horses. I'm not sure which animals become the horses, maybe the mice.She's outfitted Cinderella's outfitted with a gown and a pair of glass slippers. Why glass, I don't know but she's told she has to get home by midnight because at the stroke of twelve everything's going to turn back to what it was. The coach will become the pumpkin, the coachman will become the mice. She'll lose her beautiful clothing, so she goes to the ball, promises to leave by twelve, but she's having a great time and the prince is very much drawn to her and she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve, but gets out in time and gets back home in time. But as she's running out one of her slippers comes off and the prince picks it up and it turns out that she's the one that he wants and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the glass slipper.So a hunt is organized, so to speak, where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper. And the stepsisters, of course try and they don't it and they try to push their feet into that slipper and doesn't work and they're very upset. And lo and behold, cinderella's foot fits perfectly was her slipper. And they're very, very surprised, shocked and upset."

And the minute that he passed away, the evil stepmother started treating Cinderella very poorly. She would basically give her daughters anything and everything that they wanted.So she spoiled them rotten, but made Cinderella basically be the servant for everyone. She would have to scrub the floors, do the cooking, take care of the sisters. But one of the dreams that Cinderella had was to meet or to go and see the castle. Well, at the same time, in the castle, the king has really sort of frustrated because his son, the prince prince Charming prince Charming has not selected a bride. So he's trying to think of a way to get his son to sort of urge him along to get married.So he decides to throw a huge ball and invite all of the maidens from the entire kingdom. So, of course, the invitations go out to everyone. Cinderella's stepmother receives one, and it's asking for all of the young women to come to the ball. Of course, the evil stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited, and so they want to start getting prepared. But the stepmother does not want Cinderella to go, so she says she can go, but only after she finishes all her chores.But she overloads her with all of her chores, but she also has to help her stepsisters get ready, so basically, she has no time. However, Cinderella is friendly with all of the animals, the rats, the horses, and just everything. She can actually sort of talk to the animals. And while she is doing all of her chores, they're actually helping create her a dress. It was one that she had, I guess that was her mother's.So they fix it up and make you look obviously modern for the time and fix it up. And as she finishes all of her chores, she gets in and very sad because she thinks that she's not going to have time to get ready. But, alas, she is able to try to get ready to go, and she puts on the dress and steps out to catch the carriage to go with her stepsisters. But the rats and the animals had actually used bits and pieces of her stepsister's cast offs to make the dress. And when they saw that, they, of course, became jealous because they were spoiled rotten and not very nice.And so they started tearing her dress, the various pieces off, and so they left her dressed in tatters and left her in emotional tatters. And so she runs back to a room and is crying. But at that moment in time, she meets her fairy godmother, who is, well, a fairy, and so she is able to bippity boppity boo and cast spells, to make a dress, to make a carriage, to have just sort of a very royal type entrance. So she goes to the ball, meets Prince Charming. They have a wonderful time, but the spell would only last until midnight.So as they're dancing the night away, she loses track of time and it's about 1158. So she starts to flee the ball and she has to get away before midnight or everything goes back to the way that was. And as she's running away, she loses one of her glass slippers, which is one of the actually the glass slippers and mistranslation. It was actually supposed to be a five and leather sandal, but that's something totally separate. Loses one of her glass slippers, runs away, one of the Prince's helpers, actually, the King's helper, who is sort of like one of the Prince's friends, finds the glass slipper."

She was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them. The little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree.And little Sally was worried about the cat, so she went and found a ladder. She was going to put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and, oh, no, don't worry about it. I'll get the cat out of the tree. At which point the dog came back and scared the man and he ran up into the tree. Little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree.So she had to call the firemen so that they could come and rescue everybody.I will tell you about having my tonsils out at Christmas. I had had strep throat five times in one year, and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to have to come out, which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult and I still had them at all. So my sister came into town to stay with me during that week while I was going to be getting them out. And I had to go to Scottsdale. I think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done.But they did it, like on a day surgery. But what I remember about it most is it hurt. But my surgery was scheduled at like 1130 in the morning, but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there, I was like, a little bit dehydrated. So they couldn't find a vein.And they had to stick me, like six times in order to get the IV in. And that was very unpleasant.They finally got it in, took me into the little hospital room, and I remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, oh, that's going to be great. You're going to give me drugs, and I'm listening to Pink Floyd, so this is going to be a good day. So did that.Laid down on the gurney. They gave me the IV, and then the next thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery and my throat hurt. It was painful. I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurt so bad.They were trying to give me some water to help kind of soothe out my throat. And I couldn't swallow it, so it was coming back out of my nose. It was a mess. It was horrible. But the whole thing probably took, like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out.But it was like 12 hours of torture for that. And that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. People are like, oh, you always get ice cream.You get ice cream. But I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't have ice cream. So that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt and it was burning my throat. And it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that.And I've had people ask me, if you had to do it all over again, I'd just continue to have strep throat. That's what I would continue to."

So I remember my efforts to mentioning to my wife and father in law, let's talk about music, or let's play music. She was a piano teacher, but didn't make much of a difference.Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you? And it could be something happy or sad or anything in between from childhood to now, just something that stands out that you could tell me a short story about. Okay, so I've had a very fortunately, a very diverse life and very traveling and living in different so, let me see. So my trip on a kayak, a solo trip on a kayak in Argentina where I capsized and spent the night in a wet tent that the wind blew down and I was sort of in a bed that was all wet but too weak to do anything about it. And that may be one my entrepreneurial efforts in a train station where I was buying tickets from people who were standing in line and saving them the waiting period and then buying the tickets for the price that they would have got once they got to the window, which was a heavily discounted price.Could be as much as 60% off if the tickets were during the next 24 hours and then selling them for the official price at the line where they were lining up to buy the ticket. I don't know. What would you like me to elaborate on? I'm trying to think. Either one of those is a great choice.Yeah, just one of those. And just tell me a brief story about it. All right? Okay. All right.So I once went to a train station to buy a ticket for my mother who was wanting to go back from town a to the capital of the country in Argentina. And my mother wanted to travel the next day, so I went to buy a ticket for the next day. And there was a long line of people waiting to buy tickets for the next day. But then at the other end of the hall, there was a line for people returning tickets. So I found that if you were returning a ticket for the next 24 hours, you got 60% knocked off the price, you only got 40% of your money back.So I found somebody who was going to return a ticket for the next day, and I said, look, they're going to discount 60%. And they said what? No, that's impossible. I said, well, you can check with information office. And so this person checked and yes.So I said."

Okay, take a look at all the pictures in the book, and afterwards I'll put the book away and then ask you to tell me the story in your own words.It okay. I still am fuzzy on a lot of those details. Okay, now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can, and you can use any details you know about this story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Okay, so Cinderella is sent to live with a family, and she is basically a maid. And they're the two stepsisters.I think it's the wicked stepsisters. If I recall, they were rather homely. And Cinderella, of course, is very pretty, and she's very sweet and helpful. And these two are kind of spoiled and not very pleasant. And there's going to be a ball, and I believe invitations go out and the two sisters are going to go to the ball, and Cinderella is not invited.And somehow the fairy godmother steps in, and Cinderella ends up with, well, it's all know, right? The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach. And by dint of luck and good favor from the fairy godmother, cinderella does go to the ball. I believe the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight, so she's dancing with the prince, having a wonderful time."

So the ENT said him to the audiologist and the audiologist was in this little glass room, know, stuffed animals that moved and symbols and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this. And she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass because before she moved the drums, he was so smart.She looked at the drums and then she looked at him and then she moved the drums. And then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey at the symbol and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway, the ENT and I get into it in a big loud way because he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests.Anyway, we go through. So finally he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with a speech language pathologist. He was 2.8, I think, at that time. That fall.I'll never forget the first session, Madison. I was like, this is never going to work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early 30s. She looked like Cinderella.Blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him to the verge of tears every sessions. We were private pay.She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate the session. And she worked wonders.And we ate, drank and slept. Letters and sounds, that sheep in the Jeep book, alphabet cereal alphabet, pasta. It was like crazy town. So we did that with private pay with her. And then at three years old, the town would pick him up.So I thought, as a small town, we should at least have him have connections with that SLP just in case, with funding. And Susan Rose said, he has met whatever markers you guys can't would be not ready for me to take your money anymore. He was initially when she met him, consultation. He was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder, which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she dismissed him, you're good.He's all good to go. I was real paranoid and she's the only thing is 50% of the children with this diagnosis, the way they're taught traditionally taught how to read in public schools. They're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that know have to I don't know what? Go to private school, get another read.I didn't know what we were going to do. Madison. But I was like, So, anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP who had just graduated Madison. She was lovely, so sweet.He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on. Every time we went in there. She was so sweet.She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave. He would look at me and smile. Oh, my gosh. It was terrible.And then she went off to I don't know where. And then he got an experienced older woman who, again, cracked the whip with him. Tracy O'guerra."

Pacifier has her coat, hat and gloves on, starts at the door and tells Carl, who is big dog, to take your baby. Carl puts his hands up on the windowsills, looks out, watches to make sure the mother is gone.The baby is now standing up in the bed looking very expectantly at the dog. Dog walks over to the crib. The baby steps out onto the dog's back and they're off across the hallway to mother's bed where they have a wonderful time playing on the big bed in mother's bedroom. Then they move to the dresser where the baby puts powder on the dog's nose, has the jewelry out. The next picture has the jewelry and the top of the powder box draped on the dog's head and the baby has a handkerchief and a pin cushion on his head.Those breezes are blowing gently in the window curtains and the furniture in the room the size of furniture has changed. The jewelry box was suddenly a whole lot larger then the next scene. The baby is obviously in the hallway or in the bathroom is sitting on the edge of the laundry chute. The basket of clothes is beside the laundry chute. The dog, after seeing her baby sitting on the edge of the laundry chute runs way down the stairs, down into the top of the basement stairs.Look at the baby who's sitting happily on top of the dirty laundry after having fallen all the way down the laundry chute, goes down into the basement. The baby gets back on his back and they go back upstairs and he starts across the floor, running film mal sliding on a rug, which then upsets table in the living room scatters papers all over the floor and then goes up to the large aquarium that in one picture is sitting beside a window and in the next picture, the window is not there anymore. Anyway, the baby and the dog look at the aquarium. The next thing you see he has the baby by the shirt and is dunking the baby in the aquarium. And that baby is paddling along with his nose barely out of the water through all the fishies in the aquarium.The next thing the dog has the baby out of the aquarium sitting on the rug and has turned on the music and the dog is dancing to the radio and the baby is waving his hands in time to the music.The next scene, they have gone into the refrigerator which the baby can reach from the dog's back, opens the door.

When I was pregnant with my first child and and I read this book by Jenny McCarthy about when she was pregnant with her child and she ate all these brownies. And I thought, wow, look at her. She looks great.I'm going to eat lots of brownies too. That was a big mistake because I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time. And then my blood pressure went really high. And towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up with toxemia. And so they realized it when I had woken up one morning with like it was probably beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything.My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill my it was like a pulsating thing in my head. And I went in and I had to the clinic, which was close to my house, and I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often and it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken, then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and talk really fast and write everything down that he says, and then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day I came in, went to pee in the cup and then went to go to take my blood pressure.And I'd have to sit at this machine and it takes your blood pressure and prints it out, and then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did. I went put it in there, printed it out, I handed it to the nurse and she was just like, no, you have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay. So I do it again and it prints it out and it's just as high.So they are so irritated with me by this point, like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse, who's the professional, right, does it and realizes, holy crap, this woman's got like, really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away. And they said, we're checking you in right now because this is very serious.And they checked and they had like, I don't know, what is it, like sugar or something in my urine? So there's all kinds of problems happening with me, unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet. And after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down. But then they said, well, we could send you home, but we're not 100% sure that you could control this.So we think we should induce you because I was far enough along. And so it was a Tuesday morning, and they said, at 530 in the morning, we're going to bring you down to induce you. And this is kind of gross, but they made me take a suppository, which just really, everything's clean. But the fun part was that it was in a room where there were other people."

It's just really hard to tell from this picture, but hopefully they all get safe and get out of there. Little Boy is outside playing soccer and kicks it, unfortunately, with his toe rather than the side of his foot. Ball goes crashing through a living room window, knocks over a lamp in the house, and the gentleman in there jumps, stands up, picks up the ball, looks out the window and sees it's his favorite little neighbor kid, so he's not going to be too hard on him.Goes out, gives him the ball, and has him mow the grass to work off the price of the window.Looks like mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella. And mom keeps it. Little Boy smiling, though, says goodbye. He's walking to school and it starts to sprinkle, and then it starts raining harder. So he turns around, goes back home.Can I back up? Okay. Little boy says, no, Mom, I don't want to take the umbrella. I'm not a sissy. And Mom's angry because she really wants him to, because she can see them.It is going to rain no matter what. So he runs back home, shows Mommy's all wet, and says, okay, I guess I'll take that umbrella after all. And then he heads back to school in the rain, happy that he's got the umbrella. Okay, Cinderella. Walt Disney.Cinderella. There once was a little girl, a beautiful little girl whose mother had died, and her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her. Unfortunately, he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom, and she had two spoiled rotten little girls. And then, unfortunately, he also passed away. So the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work, all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the sewing.And she didn't have anyone to talk to. So she made friends with the animals. She'd go out and feed them, and they'd talk together, and they were her companions. One day, the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife. So he sent out an invitation to all the eligible young women in the land.And the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it. And her daughters were so happy, and they know, okay, sure, Cinderella, you can go, but you don't have anything to wear. So the little animals made her dress. They made it look beautiful. They sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do, there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball.So when it was time to leave, she came down and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be. And they said, oh, Cinderella, that's my scarf and my necklace. Ripped the things off because they said she stole it from them, even though they'd thrown the stuff away earlier. So now she really does have nothing to wear, and they take off and she's in the garden crying."

The father decides to remarry to a woman known in the story as the stepmother, wicked stepmother, who happens to have two daughters, the stepsisters, and they move in and after which point I think I've forgotten the actual order of it, but it seems like something happens with the father and it's just the four of them. And the Cinderella doesn't really have anyone anymore.She just has the animals who are her friends because otherwise she's cleaning the house and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters. And they take care they kind of are quite selfish and do whatever they want. And then from there, oh, there's the castle, far, far away. And one day they hear the stepmother hears of this announcement she reads in the book about how oh, yes, it looks like the prince is looking for someone to marry and they're going to have all of these young women come to the castle for a ball. So Cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the no, no, that one was made by herself.And then she goes and gets ready to go. And then the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are ready to go, but then they say, oh, no, you're not going to go. And they rip all of her clothes off. And then she's crying and very upset and goes upstairs and is in her room. And then I think this part is a little bit hazy.Maybe she goes out to a garden, actually, and that's when she meets her fairy godmother. And it seems like she sings a song with bippity boppity boo. Is that it? Or maybe another fairy tale. Anyway, so she waves her wand and then her dog becomes does her dog become a horse or one of the Carriagemen?And then the mice turn into something and then the pumpkin becomes her carriage. And then the rule was that after at midnight, you must be out of there because the magic will wear off. And she also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown and glass slippers. And then she goes off to the castle or the palace. And of course the prince immediately falls in love with her and wants to dance with her all night long.And the stepsisters and the stepmother do not even recognize her or everyone is watching and saying, who is that beautiful young woman? We don't know who she is. And then this clock starts to strike midnight and so she has to run out and she leaves the prince alone. And one of the prince's helpers goes chasing after her. And she's running down the stairs very quickly, loses one of her glass slippers and then goes charging away to get back to the house.And then the magic wears off and she suddenly is just Cinderella.

You don't have the bread.You put it on a plate. You take some peanut butter, you take a knife, you spread it onto one piece of bread. You take out the jelly, take the knife, spread the jelly onto the other piece of bread, put the pieces of bread together and cut the salmon in half. I had flu symptoms. Started throwing up.I got on a plane, flew cross country, thought it was better. Got more sick, strep throat, feeling fever, chills. Went on for days. Tried to get better again. Developed a cough.Went to the doctor. He said it was a respiratory inspection after the salute.I have an uncle who's from rural Appalachia and he has no teeth and he has a thick, thick accent. And she was chewing tobacco. And when he speaks, it sounds like a long slur of almost vowels. When he mumbles, it's almost impossible to discern what he's saying. What did you do about it?You have to listen really intently. I'm kind of used to the accent. If you're not used to the accent, you're not familiar with it. Between the lack of teeth, chewing tobacco in his mouth and the accent, you'll never figure out what he's saying.So I was river rafting and West Virginia, and there's this part where you get out of the raft and jump into a hydro, which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom. If you jump into the whirlpool, even with the light jacket on, it'll suck you to the bottom of the river. Normally, it spits you up five to 10ft after it sucks you down. If you hit it just perfectly, you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro and it takes you up about 50ft. I was about the fifth person to do it.The first four people jumped in and popped up 10ft later, I jumped in, hit it perfect and it carried me down to the bottom, dragged me on, started to pop me up about 10ft, sucked me back down. And I sucked in a big gulp of water as I came to the surface. Thought I was coming back down. I was about a foot from the surface. I could see the light, and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another 40ft.I thought I was going to drown. Had a light jacket on. It sucked me to the bottom.So there was a girl who got caught in a river.Doesn't look like a flood. Looks like she maybe fell in a river because they're not taking boats or anything. And there's what looks like either a cop or a fireman. He's got harness to safety equipment, safety lines, and he's wearing a life jacket and he's trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl.Kid was going to school. His mother told him to take an umbrella. He insisted. He didn't want to bring the umbrella. He didn't need it.He went to school. It started raining. He got upset and came home was soaking wet. His mother was upset that she didn't even listen to her. He changed the dry clothes, took the umbrella and left.Kid was playing soccer. He kicked his soccer ball through the window. It hit a lamp, broke the lamp. The guy inside the house jumped up, grabbed the soccer ball and looked out to see who kicked it.Anything else? No. There was a man who had a daughter named Cinderella. He was a widower. He married a new, evil, cruel woman who had two daughters of her own.The father then died, and the girl was raised by her stepmother and her two cruel stepsisters who made her do all the work and clean the house.One day the king was yelling at his son about how he needed to get married. So he was going to throw a ball and order all the single women in the kingdom to come. Cinderella and her sisters got the invitation. Cinderella was not allowed to go. Her sisters went.She was forced to stay home. The mice and the birds, though, felt sorry for her because they liked her. So they came and made her a dress and all the accessories so she could go. The sisters came home and found out about this and destroyed it. She was very sad.Then they left to go to the ball. Her fairy godmother came, made her a dress and gave her a coach and told her she had to be back till midnight, where everything went back to the way it was. She went to the ball. She."

And she gives the pretty, nice and badly treated daughter a beautiful dress and takes her to the ball. And of course the prince sees that there's this beautiful and virtuous woman who he's never met before and he wants to know who she is. And they dance and they have a wonderful time. But pretty soon the clock shows it's almost midnight and according to the legal stipulations of her contract with the fairy godmother, she must be home before twelve or else her beautiful carriage, drawn by the goofiest horses ever, will suddenly turn into a pumpkin.It's rather hard to get home in a pumpkin. So she rushes home and at some point the carriage does turn into a pumpkin. I believe I've kind of lost it there. But she gets home and on the way home she lost one of her beautiful slippers. And she doesn't realize it at the time, but that's actually a good thing to lose a slipper, because in the following days the prince, who's very upset because this woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball, he would like to see her again, he'd like her to become princess.But she vanished and the only thing left is the slipper that she lost. Unfortunately, it didn't hit anything hard on the ground or it would have just been a pile of glass shards. But he has a slipper and he makes the rounds of every household in the country. Of course not including the lower class ones, or the households that were owned by immigrants or foreigners who had been living there but couldn't become citizens, or any of the other rifraf, but just the households with eligible women who could, by means of class, be his princess. And when they get to where our heroine lives, the bad women try on the slipperer and of course it doesn't fit, but it fits on our heroine, who is then understood to be the woman that the prince danced with at the ball.And then all is well with the world."

I was tired, had one glass of wine. I can remember had one glass of wine, I had some tamales, I had beans and rice and a salad. And after that I just started really getting sleepy and tired.So I said I had to get going home. So I went home, I rolled the window down, I started dozing off a little bit and then I continued going home. At that time I lived in Upland and Upland has Euclid Avenue. It's a long street that goes north up to Mount Baldi. Well, I just lived in the foothills of Mount Baldi, so all these trees and everything, I was passing by, it was in the evening, real late in the evening, maybe like 01:00 in the morning.And all I can remember was waking up and the police officer was asking me questions and I remember it was blurry.And then I don't remember anything else after that. Then I woke up again and I was in the hospital and I woke up and there was patches all over my face. I couldn't barely see out of only one eye because my other face was covered. What happened is I ran into a telephone post and I had cuts. I still have a scar here.I had my fingers, my thumbs. I was holding the steering wheel like this. And when I hit the telephone post, I bent the steering column upward and I remember breaking through the glass with my hands. And luckily I didn't break my thumbs. I guess it got hit mostly on this arm.It pushed in this area. So that doctor stated that I didn't break my thumb because I was able to use this part of arm. But what I did do with a force and I was wearing a seatbelt, but I ended up twisting my upper torso, so I was so much in pain they fixed my oh, by the way, I cut my face somehow I tore my face right in here. I had to have plastic surgery and I had to go to a chiropractor because I couldn't even pick up my shield. So I went to a chiropractor and he took an x ray and my spine was like an S with the force of hitting that telephone post.So it took me about six months. I had acupuncture and the chiropractor was straightening my spine, pulling and tugging. He told me it was going to hurt and he gave me exercises to do with weights so I could walk straight and keep my posture straight. I was very lucky I didn't break my back."

And so he runs back home and he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he's not allowed to say, I told you so.And his mother relents and gives him an umbrella with which to walk to school, but he's already wet, so it's kind of immaterial at this point. Poor small child. You should not hit people with things. This wouldn't happen. All right.And this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again, with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right.It was a nice morning, and this bird was in the tree singing, at which point the cat thought to itself, I'm a cat. I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential. And so the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow, and the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he can't get down, so he may as well look like he did it on purpose.At which point, the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself, that cat needs rescuing because I am nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat, but the cat is too scared to come down and is certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms because it's a cat. They're ornery. And so the girl goes and gets her dad and the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there and he's not really about that.So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat. It's just a stray dog. It lives by the school that goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet. It's a nice dog. But it sees the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident.And so the man is stuck in the tree even though he could jump. That's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking, barking up the right tree. And so he pulls his cell phone out of his pocket. It's probably a flip phone, maybe a Nokia, like something really sturdy.He looks like an old fashioned kind of guy."

He's playing soccer, and he's kicking the ball, and unfortunately, he kicks it through, like, his neighbor's window, which seems to shock his neighbor, who knocks over the vase, and it wakes him up from sleeping or he's watching TV or something. It shocks him, and he's not expecting it. And then he's looking out the window with the ball to see who the perpetrator is, I assume. All right, great.We're going to do the same thing with these.

And they're excited about going to the ball, and she has no clothes but little mice and stuff, and birds make a dress for her. And so she goes to the ball in the chariot, which I guess that was her fairy godmother or something, gave her the chariot."

        "transcript": "Little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died. After which her father married a second time to a middle aged woman who he fell in love with, who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters. Poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother, her stepmother and the daughters. She did all the ironing, the cleaning and everything else. And because she was such a nice person, she did it willingly because she had a good heart.One day the old king approached his son and said, it's about time you got married. I'm going to throw a ball, and you, I hope, will find your future wife at the ball. The prince wasn't too keen on the idea, but finally he agreed. When the stepmother and the ugly sisters found out about this ball, they tried their level best to make themselves look as well as they could. They bought new clothes, they did their hair, they made themselves as presentable as they could.Cinderella, in the meantime, looked out of her window and saw the castle where the big ball was taking place, and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball. She was helped by her little friends, the mice and the owl. And they all said, oh, Cinderella, why don't you try and contact your fairy godmother? She might be able to help you. Well, Cinderella said, I don't know how to do that.And they said, well, look in the trunk. There's a book in the trunk. If you read how to find your fairy godmother, she might turn up and be able to help you. And she did that. And wham, the fairy godmother approached and said, cinderella, you shall go to the mall.And she suddenly, with her magic, was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made out of a pumpkin and coachman. She changed the mice into coachman and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress. And she said, you go and you have a good time, my child, but remember one thing when the clock strikes midnight, you must already have returned from the ball. So Cinderella promised to do that. She went to the ball.The prince fell madly in love with her and she with him. And they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock struck twelve. So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could, and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step. That was the only thing that the prince had to identify her with. Shortly after that, the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman he had no idea who she was.The only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper. So he sent a courtier round to all the families that had been invited to the ball with his little glass slipper and said, anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her. And of course, the courtier arrived at Cinderella's house and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet in the slipper. And of course, couldn't do that until Cinderella said, I would like to try. And she did.And of course the slipper fit, and the prince was delighted to have found her again."

And my husband was working for an international company that had its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. And they were looking to expand their work in John's particular area of expertise as far as marketing goes in Europe. And so they asked him and another guy who has similar job to his in the company to interview, to have a job over there.So turned out that they preferred John of the two, and so they asked him to move over to Switzerland. We were kind of obviously but we knew that we were going to have to leave our beautiful place in Vermont. I mean, Vermont, we lived there for 20 years and we loved it very much, but we knew we were going to have to leave eventually because this job was just going to take him somewhere else. So we thought, well, why not go to Europe? And so we decided to.He went over a year before I did and found us a place and did all the stuff that you have to do to get used to living in another country all by himself, which bravo him. And then I went over and joined him after our daughter got married in June of 99, we lived in a little village outside of Zurich. And it was an adorable little village. The funny thing was we lived in a very modern little apartment complex, maybe, oh, I don't know, 20 or 25 apartments in it, two levels, maybe not even that many, but anyway and everything else in the village was lovely and charming and old. And we did a lot of now that I think about it, when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of travel in Switzerland and walking around our village because Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl.So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms, and then they have walking paths everywhere because the Swiss love to walk. And so we could walk, like, to the next village and basically go and buy the fields, or we could walk through the woods. And they had passed going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company, meanwhile, bought a French scale company john worked for weighing in his case, it was weighing heavy duty, like trucks and railroad cars.And they bought a scale company in France. And so we were asked to move to France, which was like throwing me into the breyer patch because I was a French teacher. And so this was like the dream of a lifetime, actually. And so in Zurich they Speak German which was okay, that was kind of fun, too. But I had taken little German.My family is German. My dad, my grandfather spoke german as a child."

And the man and woman that took me, she was my birth father's sister and her husband. But first, another family had taken me because I weighed like less than three pounds, and they just kind of put me off in a room because my mother was really bad sick and they didn't think I was going to live. So another family had said they would take me.One of her brothers, one of my birth mother's brother and his wife. And I remember Mother telling me that when she and Daddy went up to check on Zalma, which was my mother's name, that they asked about the baby, and they said, oh, she's in the other room. She'll never make it. She's a little bitty thing.They saw about me while I was there, and they told them and said she needs a doctor and they had to go ahead and leave. And about a week later, my mother was still real sick. But my uncle, which would have been my uncle, he and his wife had taken me on to their home. And about a week after that, my mother died. And the lady and her husband that actually ended up raising me, the other uncle had called them and said, we can't take care of this child.She needs medical help. We don't have the money. We have a baby. Would you all come and get her? So they came and got me.And fortunately, they lived next door to a doctor. And Mother and Daddy were they weren't rich, but they were well off in many ways, not just monetarily. And the doctor lived next door to them. And Mother had help in the house. She and Eva McDaniel carried me on a pillow for six months until I actually was beginning to weigh about five or six pounds.And this doctor that lived next door, Dr. Price mother said that he took very good care of me. I was born without a lining in my stomach.I had some bones back here in the back of my neck that weren't very well developed, grew up in this fairly fashionable lifestyle, and I went to school under the name Meese until I was about eight, even though my maiden name really was Yancey."

They couldn't find out what was wrong, but I was slowly dying, and they knew that and that I was filled with infection and they couldn't locate it.And so finally, a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory. And I agreed because I knew that I was not going to make it. And so they went in and what had happened, I had, like, peritonitis and it had diverticulitis, and one of them burst, and that would have been peritonitis with the infection. But my body, being as wonderful as our bodies are, had tried to close it off and it had sealed it except for a little area that then it was leaking for several months. And so I was, I guess what they call septic.And so they did the surgery, and it was a long, long surgery. And I ended up with a colonoscopy. No, colostomy. Colostomy. It was the bag.And then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that. And then six months later, I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon, went back in the hospital, and they resectioned, and I was able to not have the bag anymore."

So is Cinderella assuming that she's going to go the Cinderella then pulled out the trunk and found the book and made a dress and the stepsisters ripped it all up. And I believe, let's see, then the fairy godmother gets in there and whips her up a dress with her magic wand and then reminds her that she has to be home by midnight. And let's see, she got to having a good time dancing at that ball and forgot about the midnight running down the steps. She lost the glass, one of the glass slippers.She got home and saw her one glass slipper. And Prince was pretty upset that his lover, his pride and joy had disappeared. So he did find the glass slipper on the stair and he had his guys go throughout the kingdom to see who this little slipper fit. And I remember in the movie, the stepsisters tried to put that on and even were cutting off their toes to make it fit. And oh yeah, she had gotten locked in there.The little mice let her out of the room because when they came, they didn't want Cinderella slipping out. So yes, she was able to put on the slipper and she lived happily ever after with her little mice. For your first prompt, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.First, I would probably go to the store and buy peanut butter and jelly because I do not keep that here, nor do I usually keep bread. So I would go to the store, buy all of those ingredients, probably a bag of potato chips too, because I do like to put potato chips in my peanut butter and jelly. So then I would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread. I do like my peanut butter first. So I would pull out a knife and I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread.And then I would get my strawberry jam because I'm not fond of grape jelly. So I would get my strawberry and I would put it on the right side. And then I would open my bag of chips. I would insert some chips into the middle as well as put on the side of the plate, close it up, probably cut it in half, and then."

And once the father's gone, the sister takes advantage of Cinderella by making her do all the work and treating her like a second class citizen in her own home.

I would come home and I would use really good multigrain bread, which I keep in the fridge. It's sprouted.And I would remove the loaf of bread from the fridge along with the jar of peanut butter. I would place it on the counter. I would take down a plate, and I would put two slices of bread on the plate. I would take a knife from the silverware drawer. I would actually take two knives, and I would spread peanut butter on one of the slices, one of the open slices.And then with the other knife, I would spread the very good raspberry jam.

But instead of treating her well, they made her the dirty work. She became a kind of scullery maid and she would take care of the dishes and wash the clothes she turned out was a lovely girl. While the stepsisters, of course had faces to match their evil characters, cinderella was kind of a dreamer. She read books and she often imagined that someday she would be able to meet her prince and live happily ever afterwards.The family one day received a letter from the palace plotting them to a bowl. And of course they accepted for themselves, mother and stepdaughters, but not for Cinderella. She had to stay home with all these little Disney like characters who keep flitting around her feet. So she thinks she can't go to the ball. But as she's imagining this, suddenly her fairy godmother appears and says, you may go to the ball.She furnishes them with beautiful clothes, coach horses, coachmen and so on, and says, you can go to the ball. Have a good time. She must be back by twelve midnight.Unfortunately, she doesn't make it. She does meet the prince, she dances with the prince and she turns to leave, but she doesn't make it. So everything disappears except her one little slipper, which she takes with her. The prince has fallen in love with her and doesn't know where she is because obviously she's not at court and she's hidden away, still doing her nasty little jobs at home. So he proceeds to scour the countryside because he has a slipper and he wants to find the one that will match his.So he comes to the house of Cinderella and her past stepmother and they hear that he is trying this shoe and he will use it to have anyone in the house try it on to see if her foot will match it. The original version of this story has the wicked stepsisters cutting off part of their foot so into a slipper. But even then it does not work until it comes to Cinderella. She puts a slipper on its fence, she marries the prince, they live happily."

My husband, my first husband and I we had in the bathroom was a crawl. Not a crawl space, was a cubicle. I don't know how to describe it. You had your linen closet and then underneath the linen closet was an open area which had an area inside of it to get to the plumbing at the bathtub.And we used that open area for dirty clothes, hamper. Except there wasn't a hamper in there. And for a reason, I don't remember, the children told me that there was a big animal looking out of this area. So I'm thinking, well, children. But nevertheless, I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out.And then we went outside and we saw a raccoon or possum, I'm not sure the difference with its big claws looking out at us from the air vents, I guess you call those that are in the foundation of the house. That really scared me. I thought if that thing gets in the house or gets out, it can bite the kids and it might be rabid. So I called the animal shelter, I think it was, and they told me that everybody was on lunch and so they wouldn't be there for an hour, which I blew my stack and told them that I wanted someone there now because if someone gets bit, I will sue the city. So somebody came out and the men were not happy to see this possum either because he really looked mean, him.And they took off the vent and somehow they caught him. And then they discovered, I believe they discovered a nest of baby possums which all looked very cute when they're babies, they're all kinds of babies look cute. So anyway, they took the possum and babies away and story ended happily ever after."

And I was in the Latin American Division and we covered Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. And it was very exciting because at the time, that was when there was the coup d'ETA in Chile when Salvador Allende and we had lots of money. We issued credit lines, essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin American area.So those were some pretty exciting times. And then I was there for a few years and my direct boss, who was he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office. I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor. So, of course, you know how romance always wins out. I had a boyfriend.I didn't want to move to Paris. Many people probably would have said been. I look back, I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didn't work out either. But that's okay. So I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a little more fast moving and exciting.I figured this is a good juncture to get out of banking. It seemed very stayed no matter where you were. So I got an agent. I had kind of felt my way around how things work down on the street by then. And then I ended up working for some brokerage firms.So to fast forward. Hope that wasn't too long a story.Then I had my daughter. I was a stay at home mom and the college thing was always on my mind. So I applied to Montclair State and I was accepted. I came in at the time was a second career program and the important thing was that I did it. I got my degree and I graduated summa cum laude.And I had marvelous experiences. And plus I was a day student. And that was another thing for me. I realized that I could still kind of live the life I might have. When I mentioned a day student, it was because I was always among young mainstream students and I thought, gee, maybe I'll be sort of ostracized from Maine society here.But I wasn't. And they liked me and I liked them. So it was a wonderful experience. So I got the degree anyway, and here I am."

And I couldn't lay my head down the pillow. It was excruciating.My scalp was very sensitive, so I couldn't lay my head down. I didn't really know what was wrong with me. I just thought I had a bad headache me. So I went out to the kitchen and just sat there for about an hour or two in the middle of the night and didn't really know what to do because I couldn't lay my head down. But I was exhausted, so I ended up going and there was someone staying in the room with me.I told him that I couldn't sleep, something was wrong with my head. And he was actually a neurologist. But he ended up giving me some pretty strong pills to help the pain go away. And it helped through the morning, but then the next day it continued to hurt. So I ended up going to the hospital.That evening, I was actually staying with three doctors. They took me to the hospital and they checked me in. They first did a Cat scan, Cat scan to make sure I didn't have a tumor in my brain because they want to perform a lumbar puncture and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me. So that was fine. So I ended up performing a lumbar puncture.It was a resident. It was a teaching hospital. It was UC Irvine. And he didn't do a very good job at it. So the doctor who was watching him took over.And it was painful, but they had given me morphine by this point, so I felt much better. I felt great, actually. Really warm and fuzzy inside. And I was still in the emergency room at that point and eventually the next morning got me into my own room and I felt fine by the next day. But they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much.But when I was 17, I was only eating one meal a day. But they said they wouldn't let me go home if I didn't eat more. So I had to eat three meals a day and they wanted to monitor me, but I felt great, and my thought was ridiculous. They kept me there and they kept me two more days. And they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go to check my white blood cell count.And it was pretty much the same as it was before, so it didn't show much of improvement. But I felt great, so they let me go."

No real swords or anything like that.That's not legal. But like I said, it was a reenactment. And at one point during a battle, at this particular battle, he was basically tackled by several members, which isn't usual. And when he fell, he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor. But they decided to step over him, and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids, and it wrenched his neck around.They had to call the paramedics from a nearby emergency center. We were out on the outskirts of town, on the countryside, phoenix, west Phoenix. And so the closest place was several miles away. They called the ambulance. They came out, put the neck brace on, loaded him.He was in a lot of pain. I was freaking out. I didn't know what was going on. I heard things like convulsions. I heard neck broken.I heard just it was craziness. So they loaded him up on the ambulance. I ran back to my tent because I was out there camping with him, grabbed my car keys and hopped in the car we had taken together and met him at the emergency room. When I got there, they had him in the x ray taking x rays of his neck. Turns out he did not break his neck, which was a great relief, but he was pretty badly bruised and banged up.He had severe neck whiplash and strain and was put on all sorts of pain medications and things like that. I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was, but that time in between what happened and finding out from the doctors, I was off the charts. What do you do with that? You have no idea. So it was that was really frightening to go through."

You finally it gets all better and it's all well and feels good, and you do forget about it, which is a good thing because it's no fun to go through, but it's worth it in the long run.

So he ran home, explained to his mom that he got caught in the rain and he picked up the umbrella and proceeded to walk to school.Okay, so for the first part, here's a picture. I'd like you to look at what's happening in the picture and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Go ahead and go.Are you ready for me? Sorry. Yes. You may begin. Okay, so there was a cat that got stuck in a tree, and the little girl went to have her dad get the cat out of the tree, and he climbed up the tree to retrieve the cat.He got stuck, and the mom, who's not in the picture, called the fire department to rescue both the dad and the cat up in the free."

And So Then They All Move In to Live Together, and Cinderella Tries To Befriend The Cat, and she she Has To Kind Of serve her sisters because maybe They're Kind Of lazy. I don't really know.But she does everything for them.And then it doesn't really show that in the book. But her dad does, I guess.So a letter comes and it's about going to the ball, which I think before that, Cinderella was dreaming about the castle in the far off distance. And then the letter comes and it's about going to the ball to get to dance with the prince and maybe find him a wife. And so Cinderella starts making herself a dress, and she uses a book, and she gets it all together. And then they get ready to go to the ball. And her stepsisters, out of jealousy, destroy her dress, while her stepmother looks on very proudly about what's happening.And so then her stepsisters head off to the ball and the fairy godmother comes and she makes all these wonderful things happen for Cinderella. And Cinderella gets to go to the ball. And she gets to dance with Prince Charming as her stepsisters watch enviously. And then she has to leave the ball in a hurry because she has to be home by midnight. And she loses her little glass slipper in the process.And the prince is I'm not really sure what he is, but he comes around with the glass slipper. Well, actually, I think she gets locked up. And then her little mice friends give her a key to let her out. But while that's happening, this little man comes with the slipper. And the stepmother is like, there's no one here.And somehow she gets out with her little key from the mice and she ends up with Prince Charming. All Right. Excellent. And last but not least, this first test, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before.Okay. You're going to need peanut butter and jelly, a knife or a spoon. And then you may want a paper towel or a plate or something. And then you're going to need some bread, I guess. We'll make a two sliced peanut butter and jelly sandwich?So you'll have two slices of bread and you'll take your knife or your spoon and you'll get some peanut butter and you'll spread it on the slice. And then with your other slice of bread, you'll use your knife or your spoon, whichever you prefer. You'll spread some jelly on it, and then you'll put the two slices together."

        "transcript": "Here's a little girl, and she has her tricycle, and she's holding her hands up to a tree. On the limb of the tree is a little cat. It's her cat, and she's begging the cat to come down, but the cat's holding on to that limb. But then her father must have come to see if he could help. And he had a ladder, but he didn't take the ladder.He just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch. But he's stuck there now because he can't get to him, otherwise that branch will break. And then he'll hurt himself. In the meantime, the little girl's dog comes and he's barking and barking, what are you doing up there? Come on down.I can't come up there. Another bird is taking this all in, but he's singing. He's on another branch on the opposite side, and he's still happy. But lo and behold, we see two firemen with a large ladder running toward the man because they're going to get the man out and certainly the cat off the branch. So they're parked and they're going in the back.But the thing is, the man should have taken the ladder and gone up safely, not to what he tried to do by himself. And the girl will get her cat back, because the firemen are going to get the cat down and going to get the man down. And the little bird, he'll just stay there because he's not going to be bothered. Birds are that way. They stick to a place if they like it, and the little dog will stop barking and go home with the girl.Or maybe she goes on a tricycle, she's going to go home with the cat, make sure he's all right, and the dog will follow. And the story is, when you have your tools, make sure you use them first. I need whole wheat bread, and there's a special bread that I like. It's called 17 grain bread. So I get the bread, I'll get two slices, I get peanut butter, and I like it with the nuts in it, so I wish that around my butter spoon, and I spread it very easily on both pieces.And then I have some jelly on a side. It could be raspberry or strawberry, whatever I happen to have. I'll say raspberry, and then I just put it over it very gently so the sandwich will stick nice. And then I cover it over and I cut it in four pieces so that it's easier to eat. Instead of holding the whole piece of bread, I hold us one piece at a time.And I know I enjoy that type of sandwich. Well, that would be my car accident back in quite a few number of years ago.I can't give you the exact date because I have it written down with other dates that I have."

        "transcript": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The first thing you have to do is go to the freezer and get the bread out of the freezer. And you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesn't dry out. And if there's only two of you in the house, you don't go through a loaf of bread a day. So it's important to keep it fresh.So you keep the bread in the freezer. So go to the freezer, grab the loaf of bread, take it out, untwist the twist tie, take out two slices of bread. Put the twist tie back on. Put the bread back in the freezer. Close the door, grab a plate out of the cupboard and get a knife out of the silverware drawer.Now go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter. Bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter. Go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly. Put the jar of jelly on the counter. Open up the peanut butter.Take your knife, grab some peanut butter on the knife, spread it on the bread. Put the peanut butter on the whole slice of bread on one side. Then put the lid back on the peanut butter. Open up the jar of jelly. Take the knife and take the other slice of bread and spread the jelly on the second slice.You never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with. So put the jelly on the other slice of bread and you find that because the bread is frozen, it's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly. After you've spread the peanut butter and the jelly, slap the two sides together. Turn them over like this. Cut them in half or quarters.You can cut on the diagonal, you can cut crosswise, you can cut vertical. You can cut them into as many pieces as you want. If you have a five year old grandson, you cut them into about eight pieces after you've cut them. Now you got to put the peanut butter back in the cupboard. Put the jelly back in the refrigerator and put the knife in the dishwasher.And now go get a glass. Pour yourself a glass of milk. Take the peanut butter sandwich, peanut butter, jelly sandwich and the milk. Sit down at the table and have a nice lunch. We have a crisis on our hands, folks.If this was the evening news, it would be reported by one of those talking heads that's very serious about everything. We have a little cat that's up in the tree and the cat belongs to a little girl. And dad has gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down. Climbed up on the ladder. Something happened.The ladder fell down. Now we've got the cat and the dad up the tree. The dog is helping by standing at the bottom of the tree barking a lot. Noise always helps. Somehow or other, the firemen found out about it, and they've come and they've got a ladder, and they're going to come over and set the ladder up and get dad out of the tree.And I'll probably get the cat out of the tree, too, and that dad will be happy, the cat will be happy, the little girl will be especially happy, and the dog will stop barking."

        "transcript": "You haven't gotten those cards probably when I first passed out the seven. So you're looking at your cards, and you need to try to build a hand of cards so that you will have gin. So typically, what you want to start with is if you have any pairs to start with, those are good. So you might want to put those over on one side. If it looks like you're starting run.Like if you have the queen of hearts and the nine of hearts and the ten, then you know all you need is the jack. So once we've gotten our hands all organized, we flip over the top card, and then we've decided that you're going first because I was the dealer. Okay, so you look at that card, you look at what's in your hand, and you decide if that card will help you at all. As you're trying to build your gin hand, if it looks like it would go with what you have, you take it and you put it in. Then you have to discard one of your cards, because you never have more than seven cards in your hand.Then it's my turn. If I want the card that you discarded, I can take that, and then I discard one. If you want the one that I just discarded, you can take that. We go back and forth and back and forth, but eventually one of us is going to want something other than what was put down there. So you flip the next card over, or you have to take so if you don't take that, the next card on the deck, you have to take it's your turn.Okay, so we go back and forth that way, back and forth, back and forth. Eventually one of us is going to have created a hand of Jen. And so what you'll have is you will have picked up a card, let's say it's the one you've been waiting for, into your hand it goes. And you've been holding on to this one extra card over here that you really don't need. And you take that card and you put it face down on the pile, and you see the person screams because they realize that you had the cards they needed, all of them.And then the way it's scored is you have to lay your cards out. If you have three of a kind, then you put that over to the side. If you have four in a row, we put that over to the side. Anything that you have that's left over that didn't fit into your hand of gin, we count up what that card is worth, and that goes on your score, and then we play another hand until we get tired of playing the game. And the person with the lowest score."

Because the mother was angry with the dog, spot was hiding under the couch when all of the birthday guests arrived to find the confusion. Tommy was very sad that his dog Spot had eaten some of his cake, but he told his guessed it was okay and they had brought him nice gifts and they went to Chuck E. Cheese and had a different cake that was better than the first one.The End first you get two pieces of bread and a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly and a knife. You take one piece of bread, taking peanut butter on the knife covering one side of the bread. Then you take the knife, filling it with jelly and cover the other piece of bread on one side, putting the two pieces of bread together with peanut butter and jelly. You've successfully made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When I was five years old, I had tonsillitis and had to have my tonsils removed.It was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become sore and aggravated. So I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out. The best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better. But afterwards, going home, I had to take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better, which gave me vivid dreams. And I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo.And when I woke up screaming, my mother had come in to take care of me. And it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cowhorns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake. And apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsilectomy. After about a week I got better and I was happy that I never had to do that again. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating?Yes. Please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it. I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired. And in order to work with her and explain directions and meet with her on a regular basis, we went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from my speech into sign language to explain what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates, meetings, et cetera. In addition, we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily to get around any communication barriers that we had because of her hearing impairment."

        "transcript": "Well, yes, I remember being hospitalized. The most recent one was in New York City. I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt Hospital, and my right lung had filled up with fluid, and so they kept me.I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked. The towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower. They didn't come. So I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel.I have veins that are very difficult to get blood, so I'd always say kiddingly to the people, are you really good at this? And one man named Joe L told me he was terrific. No problem. After about 20 pokes in my hand, I said, could you find someone else to draw blood? Because we're not getting it done here.And it was really all I could do to get better so I could get out of the place. Because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need. I can also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night. Of course, I wasn't breathing, and I was hacking and doing all these things, and she couldn't find the bathroom, so she just used whatever facility she could find. And when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient that's dying.So I was so unaccustomed to hospitals, and I'm probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before. And I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there. So that was my experience. That's probably the worst experience I've ever had in the hospital because everything else has always been done very well. It was crazy.If you know Roosevelt Hospital."

It hurt so bad about I stayed up all night. About 05:00, I told the wife, we're going to have to go to the emergency room. And that's really weird for me to do that.So I went to the emergency room and the nurse check me out, put some lubricant in my eye, give me a pain pill.And she called the doctor, and the doctor called when I got home, made arrangements to meet her at the office. So we got down the office and she checked my eye out again with another machine and said it was just a rub mark. It wasn't a scratch or a tear or anything. The lubricant would went. She'd give us a prescription for the lubricant.We get down the drugstore. It was for somebody else's name, another patient's name. Well, the first drugstore we went to, they wouldn't cover it. It was a Walgreens, but it's not the Walgreens that we normally go to. And they wouldn't honor the prescription.So they suggested that we get an over the counter lubricant, which didn't have any antibiotics in it, so I was reluctant to mix them. So we got home, we called the doctor again, and that was, say, 12:00 01:00. And by the time we finally got a call back from the doctor, I had a call twice to a service. When she finally called back, she laughed, said, oh, I should have known that. So what she did, that was around 06:00.So what she did was called in another prescription to a different Walgreens that's about 30 miles away from home. The wife went back up there again, and unfortunately, the doctor had called in another name, a third name. But it was close enough to the bride well name that the drugstore recognized my name. They hadn't filled the prescription because they weren't positive. They held onto the prescription until the wife got there.And then they worked it out. When they went on and filled the prescription for us, she brought went back home and well, I put another dose in there before I went to bed. I took another pill, and when I got up next morning, it was all but cured. So last night, meaning Sunday night, was the last time I took any of the lubricant. Now I'm supposed to take it every night for two weeks."

        "transcript": "Okay. I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather because he was one of the most important people in my life when I was a child. And it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten, it was in July and it was just a normal day. I was a happy, carefree child playing with my friend down the street. And it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom.You went out the door and came in for lunch. And then you went out the door and there really weren't very many parameters and there were lots of fun adventures to be had and came home to find out. That he had had a they didn't use the word stroke, but that's what he had that he had to go to the hospital from work. And so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home, he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like.I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that he wasn't coming home. And just as a child, an innocent child, kind of coming to terms with life and death, saying wow, and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home, she was around because she kind of lived with us for a while and it was just she actually I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard. Everyone went to all the adults went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that and I was hysterical crying.I was so, so sad and she didn't know what to do, so she actually slapped me to get me. And it worked. She wasn't being mean, but I was beyond being consoled at that point. And I felt very alone in my grief for some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather. But anyway, that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future.And I remember a time when I was in 6th grade and we were having a sleepover in my friend's backyard, happened to be with a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots, a girl who lost her young brother to leukemia. The other girl had lost her grandmother and I had lost my grandfather. And it was like they could make a movie about the bond. We were all in the tent and we were just talking and I can see us all sitting there and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there.It was probably the safest place to ever let it go and we all just let it out. And I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this. And it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life as I grew up. And also, as I had mentioned yesterday, that I didn't know about angels then.But now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe. And he can sort of watch over me, if you will."

And the prince found her shoe, and then she got back home and they went, and the wicked stepsisters came back.Then the prince was looking for the owner of the shoe, so he went out all across the village and the land looking for it and trying on the shoe. And they came to Cinderella's house. And at Cinderella's house, the wicked stepsisters were thrust to the front and they tried and tried to wear the shoe. But Cinderella wasn't given the chance until at the last, they saw Cinderella. And the shoe fit perfectly.And Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after."

And as the clock struck the first bell for 12:00, she looked up and realized how late it was and what was going to happen. With a gasp, she ran out of the ballroom, leaving.The prince was shocked. Not knowing what was going on. She ran out of the ballroom and down the stairs. She had to get out of there before the last bong, before the 12th bong bell. On the way down the steps, she tripped and lost a slipper, a beautiful little glass slipper.She made it home, and all the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited.So she had made it home safely without anybody figuring out who she was. And she went to her room and went to sleep dreaming about the prince. The prince wasn't happy because he didn't know who she was, where she lived, and he didn't know when he was going to see her again. So he took the glass slipper and had his servant go to every house in the city. And all the girls had to try on the slipper.And he knew that whoever the slipper fit was going to be the girl who he had fallen in love with. At the dance or at the ball, the two girls, the two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper, but their feet were too big. And the servant said, Isn't there anyone else? I've searched all the houses. There's got to be somebody else.And just then, Cinderella appeared in her work dress, and he said, ah, here's another girl. She needs to try on the slipper too. So Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper, and it slid in very easily. And she smiled. And the servant smiled and said, ah, at last I found you.And he brought Cinderella back to the castle while the sister stared after her with anger in their eyes. The prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella and they got married. Cinderella invited her stepmother stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them. And she was kind to them, and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her. And they all lived happily ever after."

Had a wonderful time and feel we must go back.We can never figure out how and when. Picked up our cruise boat on a Sunday. Got to meet people.Met most of our dinner. Very, very nice. Very compatible. As we were traveling with friends, we decided we better set up our side trips. Our first trip was London where we had been before but our friends hadn't been.Did a wonderful trip of seeing the highlights. High points there and then they dropped us off at Covenant Garden for a couple of hours. We grabbed a bite and meandered prices being what they are, we really didn't buy much but enjoyed ourselves the trip both for Paris and London. The ports are 2 hours by bus from each of them. So we enjoyed countryside scene.Following day was Paris. Took a tour of the city and a three hour boat ride on the same. Again. It was our first trip and their first trip to Paris. Again a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time.From there we had a day at sea. Enjoyed lacing around the ship itself. I would not particularly recommend but enjoyed being with the people we were with. From there we've spent a few hours in Vigo, Spain. Haven't figured out yet why they stopped there.From Lisbon again, a city we had been to before our friends had not enjoyed a tour of the city. Spent some time meandering in the square and of course, finding some pastry. My husband's favorite.From there we went to Cadiz in Malaga. A very nice city. Very friendly people, interesting architecture. Back to Genoa and then onto Genoa where we spent a night. And then we'll leave the airplane trip back in the realm of nightmares.At least from Charlote to Phoenix on US. Air. And don't ever ask me to fly US. Air again. And how is that for a vacation?"

Certainly it affected my ability to communicate at the level that I would have previously.It probably affected my ability to communicate them more by it, by by changing conversations more one way types of conversations as opposed to the bi directional style that we would have had prior to that. It was more information giving and required seeking responses in or placing questions in such a way that the responses could be given in sort of binary yes no sorts of answers or that could be expressed by facial expressions and so on.I guess to describe a particularly happy or sad event in my life, I'd select maybe a recent one. Back in mid February, my daughter left, flew out of Cincinnati, Ohio or actually in Kentucky greater Cincinnati area airport to Frankfurt, Germany to begin her studies in Heidelberg, Germany. And so her flight left about 11:00 in the morning. My wife and I then we drove her up to Cincinnati and it was both a very happy time and also a very sad time. Happy because she was leaving and going on to this new stage in her life.Sad because she is our only child and really she's lived close to us all of her life.But it was very good to get back and visit her over spring break to know that she's doing well and enjoying herself. And fortunately, with electronic communications as they are, we communicate. My wife and she communicates made at least multiple times a week, almost daily, sometimes using Skype. And it's really a wonderful thing to be able to have that sort of connection. Makes absence much easier to live with."

They got the tumor out, but at the same time, it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to understand well. It was difficult trying to develop lists of things that she wanted done around the house, but we managed to work out a pretty good system of she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper, which she always kept with her. And that seemed to help a lot because she could remember something short term, but an hour from now, forget it.But just by carrying that pad around with her all the time, she was able to make lists of things. So when I came home, I knew what she wanted done, and we were able to bridge the gaps for a while until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home. I've had a stress free life. Okay. When I was in high school, I was out with some friends at Prescott.There's no death in this story.And we were walking along, and it's all rocks along the edge of the Lake Superior. It's not a beach at that particular spot. And it was a big rock cliff on one side. And I looked over at it, and I thought I could climb it. And one of my friends said, I don't know.It's awful high. Oh, no, I think I can climb it. Well, I managed to climb almost to the top. It was probably a 60 or 70 foot cliff. And I got up within about 510ft to the top and then ran out of handholds.Now, I was looking down. I didn't want to look down anymore. It was way far down. But I was able to move off to one side, and there was a tree that was actually hanging over the top of the cliff. And I was able to reach up with one hand and get a hold of it and then pull myself up.But at that point, I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was. But there was only one way to find out, and it was strong enough. Since I'm here."

It was during practice.We were doing a drill, and I had the ball, and the other guy had to tackle me. And I was kind of supposed to let him tackle me. So I go and I let him tackle me, and as he tackles me, he throws me to the ground, and my shoulder pad actually comes up, and I end up just landing on the ground on my shoulder, and it kind of cracks. I go, Terrible, terrible pain. And I go off to the side and coach checks me out and says, yeah, you need to get checked out.Then I end up the next day, I think it was that day, I go to the hospital just to have them look at it. I don't know if I consider hospitalized overnight, but I wasn't overnight. Just go they look at it, they say, well, you're I'm sorry, I skipped the part. I go to my sports doctor first. He says, it's probably a dislocation, not a separation.If I got this right, the difference between a separation and dislocation is the distance. Anything past 8 CM is a separation, anything less is a dislocation. And mine was at seven, so 7 CM separated. I still have it to this day, a little bump that has formed from it. So, yeah, he tells me that, says, go to the hospital.Just to have them get you the correct equipment and stuff for it, just to take care of it, like a sling and some other stuff, and they put me in a sling.Wasn't really too painful, it just hurt when I landed on it.And I mean, I was out football for like I think I was only out of football for like, two weeks because I really wanted to push myself and I didn't want to miss that much.

In case the cat comes down, she has a tricycle in front of her.

On the right side is another branch which has a few leaves on it. And one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing at the same time.

Okay, so first you go to the store and buy bread, jelly and peanut butter.And make sure that you have a knife and a plate ready and possibly some napkins. So you will take the bread out of the Bread plastic bag if it is sliced Already, and you will put out two slices. Get the knife to be ready to spread on peanut butter on one slice. And first, you unscrew the lid of the peanut butter jar, put in the knife, give a nice glob of peanut butter and spread it on one slice. And and if you want to contaminate your jelly, you can use the same knife.If not, you might want another knife to spread jelly on the other piece of bread. And once you're done, make sure everything is closed and put back in the fridge. And you can put the two slices together and you're done."

Oh, it's a guy gene. It's a foreigner.I have some kind of problem because I'm a foreigner. So then it seems to be working. It seems like, okay, I'm on the way going to have this baby. And then it just kind of stopped. And they said, okay, well, it's not going to work today.We'll try again tomorrow. Tomorrow's Wednesday, so we go through the same thing again. Actually, I think I started on Monday. So it was Monday, Tuesday and then Wednesday. So I was induced three days in a row, and it seemed to work less every single time, like the medicine or whatever it was.And I tried to tell them, I'm like, I'm not a doctor or anything, but I think you're only giving me the amount of medicine that you would for a small Japanese woman, and I am not a small Japanese woman, so you need to give me more in order for this induced thing to work. And they said, no, on Thursday, our plan is we're just going to give you a Caesarean and we're going to take the child out surgically so the story doesn't end. So then they go and bring me in and of course I'm completely naked. They had a gown on, but then of course they take it off. And that's pleasurable to be in a room full of people completely naked and pregnant and foreign and all of that stuff.And they had me lean naked on this woman who was a nurse. I had to lean forward on her. And they went to put this shot in my back, but then the doctor kept not getting it, so they did like three different shots and finally it worked. So then they had me lay back in this tea fashion and put up a curtain. And men are not allowed, so the husband's not allowed in Japan.I just remember I didn't really feel any cut or anything like that, but then I felt like a tug, tug, tug, and then heard the baby crying and everyone's like, oh, so it's a boy, it's a boy. And then it was all good after that. So that was a happy it was kind of like a scary story, but then also happy in the end because I got my son, so."

I don't think we find out how she got to that situation, but clearly her father did not marry well. And the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a slave. She always she had to do all the cleaning and all the cooking and all the washing and take care of them, and didn't get treated nicely, and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes, and she wasn't given the best food to eat.And anyway, she was just treated horribly. One day, the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an invitation from the palace to come to a ball. Cinderella, thinking she's a member of the family, thinks she can go along, but she can't. So she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get ready for the ball. And then they go.After they leave, she's very disappointed because she really wanted to go to the ball. And somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she can go to the ball, but she has to be home by midnight. So she gives her a beautiful dress to wear, lovely new shoes, and turns a pumpkin into a carriage, turns the mice into horsemen and horses, and the only rule is be back by twelve. So Cinderella went to the ball. She had a wonderful time.Nobody knew who she was. Everybody was saying, oh, who's that woman? Who's that woman? The prince danced with her the whole evening. She had a lovely time.And then, as the clock was striking twelve, she realized she had to leave. So she ran out. In running out, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper, made it to the carriage and got home just as the carriage turned into a pumpkin. Following that, the prince found the missing slipper and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper. So he traveled all over the kingdom, trying the shoe on women's feet to see if it fit.It didn't fit anybody. Finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly stepsisters and he tried it on their feet. It didn't fit any of them. And he saw Cinderella and said, why don't you try it? Or possibly she said, Why don't I try it?And he tried it on and it fit. And he was ecstatic because he'd found the love of his life after having danced with her for a few hours. And she, of course, being swept off her feet, agreed to marry him, not understanding what it would mean that she would just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and cooking. But the book doesn't take you that far. It only takes you to the part where they meet and they fall in love and live happily ever after."

Well, my mother is the one that comes to mind, and we FaceTimed a couple of days ago, I guess it was Friday. And what was interesting is she does not remember from day to day or even minute to minute what has happened. But it's clear she can still acquire skills because she's gotten better at holding the little phone or iPad in front of her.She managed to keep it on her face this week or last week, but the conversation was the same, which is she's delight always in the moment and happy to see me, but cannot follow a conversation very well. Forgets what you've asked. Actually, I've just stopped asking her questions, but rather sort of prompting her with ideas or words or whatever. Sometimes I ask questions, but not all the time, but her memory is much like there's just no beginning or end. I think the metaphor I used last week is that she'll look through a series of pictures endlessly and make relatively the same comments.So mostly if she starts talking and she talks less than she used to, I'll redirect if she gets into something that is agitating to her or kind of super sad if she keeps repeating it. But that doesn't happen very often. Most of the time she kind of discovers anew that she's talking to people. Like you can see her look away and then she'll look at the screen and kind of, oh, hi, delighted to see you. So she's getting a little better at understanding that.She seems to be able to remember that she's done something like this before and that if she looks in a certain place, we can see her and she can see us. And her memory has been fading over the last decade. But looking back, I realized she had trouble even before then but had better coping skills and it was manageable. She made a lot of lists. She relied on my father, who was then still alive, to prompt her for things.So the decline has been steady and longer than we thought at the beginning, but she seems very happy to be in the moment, so that's good."

So I was in a lot of pain.I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things. And so Dr. Geiger put me under, and when I woke up, my throat hurt horribly. Apparently they had told me they were going to shove what are those things called? A ventilation tube down my throat.And that hurt more than anything else when I woke up. And they gave me some medication and sent me home. And two weeks later I got pregnant. Woo. And now I have a third baby.The end."

Of course, the stepmother had no idea that it was Cinderella, but they were bringing the prince and his entourage around to try that slipper on, and whoever's foot the slipper fit, then they would be recognized as the new princess.The stepmother locked away Cinderella once again so that she wouldn't have the opportunity to even be addressed and tried fitfully to make sure that her daughters had the opportunity to get their foot in the slipper, which they didn't fit well. And Cinderella was unable to escape and make her appearance. But when the stepmother realized what was going on, she actually broke or caused the breakage of the glass slipper, thinking that this would prevent them from being able to place it on Cinderella's foot. But then Cinderella was able to produce the other slipper from her gown, and so they put it on her foot. She was recognized as the new princess, and she and the prince were married and ruled the kingdom.And it was always my hope when I heard the story, that she made the evil stepmother and her two sisters the stablemates for the castle.

I've done yoga from a really young age. I'm very blessed. But I had a really, really crazy time in college, and I kind of knew that that chapter was closing and something new was opening, but I was I did not work again. And so I was in the Havill Public Library, and I swear by this, the book fell off the shelves.Like, I didn't touch this book. This book fell off the shelves, and it was called Spirit Jumping Book. And my whole life changed after that. She broke down the gift of healing, of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I had never heard of. And I went to a Catholic school and was kind of like, religion of politics, it's not for me.And she just opened up this door that you can heal through this way of prayer and of asking for help, something that was so foreign to me to just ask for help. And so I started doing her writing exercises. I started doing her meditations. I just threw myself into this lifestyle. I started praying every night.I started praying every morning. And I started noticing that my life was getting lighter, that I was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have before because I was blocking myself. And she was showing me this box. So picking up that book and dedicating myself to spirituality and the biggest thing being meditation, she had no exception. She wasn't like, oh, you can't really meditate.Like, do two minutes. She was like, Sit down for five minutes. You have time for this. This is so important. And that book led me to daily prayer, to meditations, to traveling, like, far beyond what I ever thought that I was brave enough to do.That led me to India, where I became a yoga teacher. It's led me to meet Gabrielle Bernstein on several occasions. I listen to her podcast regularly. I share her message. And I swear I've been on this earth for 24 years.But on that shelf now, I think about my job and how I can get backed up in people and how I can keep traveling, how I can care for my family and how I can care for the people that I love. But the number one priority above starting a family or starting a career is to continue to just make that my foundation. Displays of peace.Wow."

You would say sick, but I've had a lot of problems with arthritis, and I have of osteoarthritis in my knees.They gave me a lot of problems over a long period of time. I went to the orthopedic surgeon and he said, we're not ready to operate on you yet, but we'll do an arthroscopic approach. But, you'll know, when it comes time to have surgery, real surgery. So in 1996, when we went to Italy and we were going through the ruins from Mount Vesuvius, my knees were in such terrible pain that I told my friend from San Francisco, if you had a pocket knife that was really sharp, I'd lay down your work on these knees at the present time. So my knees hurt me for a long time.So in 1997, I decided that it was time to eliminate that process. So I went to see the orthopedic surgeon. She said, well, we'll do one of them, and then we'll do the other one later. And I said, no, let's do them both at the same time because I'm a coward. And if you take that first one, I'll probably never come back and take it and have the second one done.So on February the 19th of 1997, I had bilateral knee surgery and both knees replaced. And on the February the 20th, 97, the nurse came in and said, get out of that bed. You got to get up and walk. And I said, you got to be crazy. So they rolled me out of bed and got me up on my feet and then dropped me and I fell into a chair that was near the bed.So it really didn't hurt me a whole lot. But the next morning, they got me up. I had to walk across the room. And the third morning they got me up, I had to walk all the way to rehab. And I've been walking on those knees for 13 years since."

Meanwhile, back at the castle, the wicked stepmother has discovered that Snow White is not actually dead because she asks in the mirror and the mirror persists in telling her that she's still not the fairest and the land of the Snow White is alive and well and she's playing music and having fun with the seven dwarves. So going against her original ambitions, the wicked stepmother transforms herself into a more unattractive person and poisons an apple and I guess, finds her way to the seven dwarfs cottage.And the seven dwarfs are out at the diamond mine and they sing a famous song. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go. And Snow White is left at the house alone.

And so he picked up the ball, looked at the lamp, and then looked out the window and saw that it was Little Johnny.And that's when the story ends. So looks like Little Johnny's probably going to have to mow the yard many times to pay for the damage. All right, great. And then same thing with these. So just take a look at them and then tell a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end.Whenever you're ready. Okay, so here we have little Danny, and he's getting ready to walk to school, and his mother is asking him to take his umbrella along with him, and he's refusing because he's a stubborn little fella. And as he's getting ready to go, his mom tries to say one more time, do you need to take your umbrella? And he said no. So on his way walking to school, it starts to rain, and he realizes this was not a good decision and starts to rain even harder on his way back home.So he gets back home and he's soaked, and his mother not wanting to tell him, I told you so, but was a little frustrated with him, and he got his umbrella, and so he left and then walked all the way back to school. All right, excellent. Same thing with this. It's a little bit different. It's kind of an entire scene.They look at everything and then tell me a story at the beginning, a middle and an end. Okay, so Susie was outside playing on her tricycle, and their cat Scruffy was out there with her. And Scruffy decided to climb up the tree. And just like most cats, likes ignoring humans. So it crawled up the limb and crawled up way far out.And so she went inside and told her dad to come and say, hey, can you help me get the cat down? So the dad decides that he's going to rescue the cat Scruffy, by getting the ladder and climbing up there. So as he gets the ladder, puts it against the tree, the dog Sparky, came over and actually knocked the ladder down. So not only was the cat Scruffy, in the tree, but the dad was, too. So meanwhile, someone had to call the fire department to come and help because the dad was too far up, it's too high to jump.He can't climb down because there's only a few branches. So the firefighters are on their way to come and save the day. Not only are going to save dad, but they're also going to save the poor cat. Scruffy."

Obviously, I wasn't in school, so my aunt was doing homeschooling for me if you wanted to keep me right up with the class. So I never did miss any schooling in my class. And when I was able to go back to school, I picked up right where I left off, if you will, or right where they were at that time. But basically we did nothing.It healed itself, and I went to the doctor. We lived about three or four blocks from the doctor, and at that time, I was using the scratches to walk around on, but prior to going to the doctor, I was playing in the doing something in one room, and I got up and I walked over to the other side of the room to pick up something. That was the first time I'd walked without crutches for ever, for six, seven, eight weeks. And it was very miraculous that I could do that. So anyway, we went to the doctor that afternoon, and when we got to his office, we walked in the door, and my aunt said, Show him what you can do.So I put the crutches on the ground, and I walked over to his desk. And he said that's absolutely astounding he said, I did everything I could do to help you. But he said we had a little bit of help from somewhere other than what I could do. And from that moment on till today, I've not had any problem, except occasionally, since it was a tender area, I was not able to wear high boots or high shoes because it would irritate it to the point where it would heal. But we finally got over that, and I went through the service.I wore combat boots and had any problem at all, and I've never had any problem since that time, never had any limping or anything else. It was foreshortened by about maybe a half an inch, but my body adjusted to it and my right leg bowed enough so that I never had a limp. But that did create a problem where I had to have a knee replaced a few years ago because of the angle and the pressure on that knee caused by this over the years. But at 82, I'm still having no problem. When I was 50, I would run around the block every day in the morning when I got up, but lately I haven't been able to do I haven't done it, really.I haven't done that too much. I walk the dog now, and that's about to extend them. But that is what happened to me back in the 30s that I remember. What."

And at the time I was talking to the doctor, I said, you know, my wife hadn't had a physical for I don't know when. I said, why don't I just make an appointment for her and you give her a fiscal while I'm gone.And so I was gone for two weeks. And when she met me at the airport and we got in the car, settled in, and she says, I'm going with you. And I said, what do you mean? She said, Well, I've got gallbladder trouble. Said that.The doctor said of the 2 hours I should be operated on first. And I said, you're kidding me. And it all came out that that's the way it was. We both checked into that hospital the same day. Prior to that, I'm a Scotsman.And the doctor said he was going to operate on me for $600. And $600 a lot of money. At that time, I'd still picked up off the floor.So I said, well, what are you going to charge me for my wife? I said, There should be something. He says, which one of you do you want me to slight? I said, Well, I don't want you to slight either one of us. And he said, well, it'd be $600 apiece.And to finish up the story, we both got out all right. We both were in the hospital at the same time. I had a room that had a TV in it, and she had a room that it was air conditioned mission. So she'd watch TV in my room and I'd go up there in her room where it was cool and both operations were a success. And here I am telling you about it.End of story."

And immediately the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree, where the cat ran to an outer branch and felt safe that the dog wasn't going to be able to get her out there. Well, then Joe realized the cat was in the tree and rode her tricycle out to try to get the cat out of the tree. But she couldn't reach the cat, so she called her dad, and her dad put a ladder up, went partway up the tree and couldn't reach the cat, and ladder fell down. So then somebody called 911, fire department came, and with any luck, they will be able to put their ladder against the tree and get dad back off out of the tree.And I think the cat will be up there until it feels like coming down.Typical cat.

Got back down here and was still not feeling well.And then I started to realize what I was having was a severe form of my IBS, which I have very seldom, but occasionally, which causes the pain, causes me to pass out. So I tried to find my particular little pills that cut down on those stomach cramps, and I couldn't find them. Unfortunately, I was standing at the time. So I passed out from a standing position down onto our hardwood floor. Scared my husband to death.He came in and tried to wake me, and when he couldn't wake me, he called 911 in Nashville.

So she gets a good head start, even though she's wearing heels, glass.She runs out of the ballroom, down the palace stairs toward her coach, the prince chasing after her all the while on the bottommost stairs, she loses one of her shoes. She doesn't have time to stop and pick it up. She leaps into the coach. It starts right racing out of the palace crowns and down the road as the clock slowly strikes midnight. And on the way, it transforms back into a pumpkin and her clothes back into rags and she has to run the rest of the way home.The prince has been unable to catch up with her in time. He did not have a coach at the ready, being in his own palace and all. But he has the shoe. And he looks at the shoe and it's very delicate in tiny anything, because I have a clue. And I shall not rest till I find this woman because truly, she's the hottest lady I've ever seen.It's got to be her, nobody else. So he sets off the next day to Tori's kingdom, which is actually quite modest but still kingdom, and goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person, every woman of eligible age, and it doesn't fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason. And finally he gets to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother. And he tries the shoe on the first stepsister and it doesn't fit. And he tries it on the second stepsister, and it doesn't fit.And he's about to leave when he sees in the corner of the courtyard this little servant girl and she's sweeping away all of the dust. And he just has a sense. He has a sense. He says, I don't know. She's kind of dirty, but she looks kind of hot.I don't remember if she's as hot as the lady I saw last night, but let's give it a go. So he calls her over, and the stepmother the whole time is like, oh, no, it couldn't be her. She's just a gutter wench. You don't want anything to do with her. She's dumb, she's ugly, she's infertile.Why not consider one of my know? They might not be your first choice, but they're a pretty good second bet. The prince continues to waver away, and he approaches Cinderella and he asks her to try on the shoe, and she does, and of course it fits. And he thinks, good enough for me. And he whisks her away and they marry.And depending on your sense of vengeance, possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters. Possibly they just feel really bad. Supposedly, everybody lives happy. Everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after. The."

And so we packed up without any motorhomes, just tents and sleeping bags, trailers, trailer and chainsaw and axes, lots of food and cooking supplies for my mother in law. And early Saturday morning we drove up to Paison. We followed along a dirt road that the ranger had recommended and we found a nice place to camp with lots of dead trees around us.After we set up camp, we unloaded our ATV and we started dragging huge logs back up the hill to our camp. We cut the logs, we cut the long tree stumps into logs and laid them next to the camper where we would load them the next day. But mother in law was going to be sleeping in the camper or not the camper, but the trailer, so we couldn't load till the next day. My husband and I stayed in a tent on the air mattress and it was so nice. It rained as we were going to sleep, but we could still hear the crickets, the popping of the fire just outside the tent.That's how I went to sleep. It was beautiful. Sometime during the night I woke up. We woke up because it was a coyote howling close by. So we got up and we opened up the tent.The rain had passed, the sky was clear, there's a million stars. And we sat and listened to the coyote. And it was so dark out there besides the stars, there was nobody else around us. And I was able to get out of my sleeping bag and wander around in just my underwear and sneakers. And it just felt so good because nobody could see me, nobody cared.And seems like I stayed up half the night looking at the stars and listening to the coyotes and got up in the morning and Grandma cooked pancake sausage over a propane grill and we loaded up the firewood and went on home. It was one of the best weekends I'd had."

        "transcript": "Okay, what I'm going to describe is an acoustic neuroma and a craniotomy for the acoustic neuroma. I discovered this when I was talking on the telephone working at the office. Had the telephone up like this, on this ear. So I can write like this, take notes. It was a fairly long phone call.I get a stiff neck. So switched the telephone around to the other side and the volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to this side, and it was much quieter. So I figured there's something wrong with the ear. My left ear is not hearing the way it should.Anyway. Went to an ENT specialist, and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma, which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull. We did some research, found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery. Went out, had the surgery performed. For the surgery itself, first thing I do is shave this side of your head.I got a haircut before I went out so it would be short, so I wouldn't look like I had real long hair on this side. I remember the prep. I remember the shaving for the surgery. Then you're under. You're totally out of it.I didn't wake up and have consciousness until what I think was the second day following the surgery. They keep you out because they don't want you moving around. The surgery involves cutting a hole in the head so they can get into where the nerves are, get the tumor taken off of it afterwards. It was a recovery that took a week or ten days before we recovered enough to be able to come back home. I had a nice scar up this side of the head, kind of shaped like a light bulb.And they put a stereotype on it to kind of hide it, keep it sterile. The nice part about heading back was we'd go to the airport and I'd sit in the chair, and I'd sit so that that side of my head was toward the ticket counter. And my wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say, my husband's had some brain surgery and he's not feeling very good. Is there any possibility that we could move up to first class? Class?And everybody would take a look at me slumped over, looking half dead, this big scar running up the side of my head. We got moved up to first class on every flight. Kind of neat. But my wife is clever, and she does things like that."

But in the meantime, a really aggressive dog has discovered that this demented man is in the tree because it's just a really kind of a jerk dog, is really getting after it, barking at him very vicious, to the point where is completely ignoring the child, trying to get her cat, who's also now scared out of the same tree, when if the dog really wanted, she's right there to bite. But for whatever reason, he's locked on to this man. There may be a history between the two of them, but we don't know that part.So that's the situation as it plays out here and this little girl and her cat are completely unrelated to what's happening.

She just knows that her cat's stuck up there. She dragged her own ladder out to try to get him down, but evidently it failed because she just left it lying on the ground. So that's the situation as we find it.I'm sure that eventually the dog will have to be taken to animal control or given back to the owner with an admonition to do a better job of keeping him restrained. And since the firefighters are there, they go ahead and get the man and try to locate where he belongs. I'm sure there was a silver alert issued form at some point, so that's the outcome as it relates to him. And then since they were there, they went ahead and got the cat out of the tree for the little girl, kind of as a bonus."

And so they all came to live together.And unfortunately, his daughter, Cinderella was treated rather shabbily by the stepmother and the stepsisters. She was made to do all the housework, and she was made to take care of everything. Her only friends were the mice, and so she was living a rather miserable existence. In the meantime, in the castle in the distance lived a king who wanted his son to get married. He said, okay, it's time.You need to find a wife. So they decided to have a ball, and they sent out invitations all over the land for people to come to the ball. Of course, the stepmother got the invitation and was simply thrilled. All the girls were very excited. Surely one of them was going to get to marry the prince.And they got all this finery. And night of the ball came, and Cinderella put on a pretty dress that the mice had somehow arranged for her, and they told her, no, you can't go. You stay home. So they went off to the ball. Cinderella was rather dejected, and she went out in the garden, and there was a fairy godmother.And she said, what's the matter, Cinderella? And Cinderella said, Well, I want to go to the ball. I can't go to the ball. The fairy godmother said, I will arrange for you to go to the ball. She waved her magic wand and dress turned into a beautiful ball gown.She waved it again. The pumpkin turned into a coach, and the mice became the horses to carry her to the ball and possibly a footman. So she went to the ball, and the prince was smitten with her and danced with her. Oh, the fairy godmother had told her she had to be home by midnight. So now she's dancing with the prince, and she hears the clock start to strike.So she realizes she has to leave. One of the pieces of finery the fairy godmother provided was a pair of glass slippers. So she runs away from the prince, runs down the steps in the course of running down the steps, steps out of one of her glass slippers, leaves it behind, runs to the coach, and goes home. Now, the prince is left with only a glass slipper and a memory of this gorgeous young woman, and he decides to go throughout the land and try to find her. Whoever will fit in the slipper will be his bride.So he goes around. He gets to the house where Cinderella lives, and the wicked stepsisters can't fit in the shoe, although they try.

He'd go out and build things and mow the lawn and do all of these different activities for his entire life, and that's what defined him.But then all of a sudden he wasn't able to do that and he grew really quite cantankerous and very frustrated.

She's with the farm animals, she's cleaning, and her ugly sisters get to have a good time with beautiful clothes. And Cinderella has all the menial tasks around the house.And the little mice in the house seemed to be her friends, and they helped her.

Suddenly her fairy godmother appeared and said, would you like this beautiful dress?And Cinderella said, oh, yes. So the fairy godmother touched her with a wand. And Cinderella was the most beautiful person at the ball. And at the ball she danced with the Prince.And the clock struck twelve and everything returned as it was. So Cinderella wasn't in her beautiful dress. Her beautiful carriage had turned into a pumpkin, and she lost her glass slipper as she left the ball. And later on the Prince came by saying, whoever belonged to that glass slipper would be his bride. And he tried it on Cinderella.It fit her. It didn't fit her ugly stepsister.

And she had a mirror that she consulted frequently about who was the most beautiful person in the land. And one day the mirror told her that the queen was not the most beautiful anymore, that Snow White was. So the queen hired some one to kill Snow White, but the hired person was unable to actually do so.So he put her into the dark forest and she was terrified and ran through the forest and ended up coming upon a little house in the middle of the forest. And she went in, there was nobody there. She decided to clean it up and did all of her cleaning and eventually got tired and fell asleep. And meanwhile the seven dwarves who were the owners of the house came home and they found her asleep. They were all a little bit freaked out, but they decided to keep her since she had cleaned their house up for them.So they lived happily for a while and she cooked their meals and cleaned their house and they went off to work every day. And meanwhile the queen discovered using her mirror that she was still not the fairest in the land and Snow White was still alive. So she decided to disguise herself as a witch.Go back out there. Why? Because I asked you to.She decided to disguise herself as a witch and take a poisoned apple to get Snow White to eat right here. You have to be quiet.Sorry.Let's see, where are we? So yes, the queen disguised herself as a witch and came to the little house while the dwarves were away at work and cooked Snow White to eat an apple that was poisoned. And she fell into a deep sleep and they thought that she had died. And the Doris came home and discovered it and were heartbroken. And while they were holding her funeral, the prince came along and kissed her and she coughed up the apple and awoke from the spell and they lived happily ever after.And the witch, the leaf got struck by lightning and fell off of a cliff and died."

But hopefully he just gave the kid back his ball and fixed his window and remembered what it was like to be a boy. Here are some more pictures that tell a story, so take a look at all of them. And then I'd like you to tell me a story about what you see with a beginning, a middle and an end.Little boy was going off to school and his mom told him to take an umbrella with him because it was supposed to rain. And the little boy said no mom, I don't need an umbrella, it's not going to rain today. Mom said, okay, you can go, but it's going to rain. Then he went outside and it started raining and he turned around and came back. He's like, oh, I should have listened to you the first time, mom.She said, yes, you should have listened and you wouldn't have gotten all wet. Well then she gave Johnny the little umbrella and he went back out to school and stayed drier. So for this next task, here is a picture. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. So I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.It was spring or fall day. I'm going to go with spring because I like that better. And this little girl was out riding her tricycle and she saw a cat up in the tree and she looked and then she saw a dog barking at the bottom of the tree and the cat was afraid of the dog. So she was trying to tell the cat that it was okay, jump down, let me help you. But she couldn't get the cat out of the tree, so she got her dad who brought a ladder and the dad climbed up the tree and the ladder fell down so he couldn't get down again.And the cat and the dad were stuck in the tree. Then the fire department came with a ladder of their own and they were working to get the man and the cat down safely and not get bit by the dog.Hopefully they did that."

The sisters are very terrible to her, really rude, but she still tries to be very sweet. She has really good relationships with animals, and that's where she finds kind of her comfort and friends and stuff like that. And the king is trying to find his son a wife to get married to. So they throw this big grand ball.And in this ball they cordially invite all these girls. They invite the stepmom, the stepsisters, and Cinderella. But the stepmom and sisters say Cinderella is not allowed to go. And she has her dress made. She's so ready, she's all dressed up.And when she goes downstairs, they literally laugh at her and say like, you're not going? Absolutely not.

So right before twelve, she leaves him.And as she's running away, she leaves a glass slipper. And this glass slipper is what the prince finds when he runs after her.

Okay, to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, to start, you would need a plate, you would need a knife. You get a can of peanut butter and a can of jelly. And then you open the two pieces of bread. You would spread peanut butter on one side.You can have crunchy or smooth, any kind. So you take the bread in your hand, dip it into the peanut butter and spread it over. And then you dip it into the jelly on the other side and put it all over the other piece. Put them together and you have a peanut butter jelly sandwich."

Like, I don't think it's possible for anybody to catch a six year old that doesn't want to get caught. And so she runs out the door and the wolf's kind of staggering drunkenly after her in this nighty and Mobcap and Snow White, red Riding Hood is legging it for the woods. And then the woodcutter comes out and says, I've been following you discreetly this whole time because you're six and we really shouldn't let you out in the woods alone.Also, I'm your father.

And lo and behold, there is, in fact a wolf in her grandmother's clothing chasing her.And the Woodcutter says, you get back to the cottage. I'll take care of this. And he holds up this huge axe. And in the original version, he proceeds to chop up the werewolf and then they cook and eat the wolf. I said werewolf.Again, they proceed to cook and eat the wolf. But that's not what happens in this light hearted children's story. What happens is he chases the wolf into the woods, brandishing his axe menacingly, and Red Riding Hood goes into the cottage and finds her grandma tied up in the closet or whatever, still humming Led Zeppelin because every grandma loves Led Zeppelin. And she finds her grandma some more clothes because nobody wants to look at that. And puts her grandma back in bed and gives her all the stuff from the basket.And eventually her mom comes because her mom's still pretty stupid and just followed later. She's like, My kid will be fine in the woods alone. I'll just go up in an hour or two when my soaps are done. And so she came up in an hour or two when her soaps were done and they shared a hearty meal from this basket of goodies. And the woodcutter came back and said, I chased that wolf so hard, he is probably never coming back.Also, he ran on his back feet and he talked English. Also, I'm your dad.

He's kind of a crotchety old dude anyway.And so he stands up, he's looking out the window, he's getting ready to chuck the ball back at the kid, probably in a very kind of spiteful way. He also wants to know who the kid belongs to so that he can charge the parents for the replacement of his lamp and his window.

So they said that I needed to be admitted to the hospital for that reason, not because of the other issue that I'd had.And they and when I was in the hospital, I was put on a complete liquid diet for a couple of days and had continued to have tests, blood tests that I think told them what was going on. And at the end of several days, they said that I was recovering and so I could go to add a few more liquids, but I guess, like oatmeal and things like that, that was the first time in a hospital, because I've had other hospital experiences, that I had a hospitalist caring for me. And it was really interesting. He was a great guy and was very, very helpful in helping me understand that what I really needed to do to keep myself safe and healthy from the pancreatitis. And so he told me that if I ever had flare ups of it now, of course, I didn't have a flare up at all.I mean, what I had was not a flare up of that. But if I did have a flare up, which involves pain usually, and see it's a different place, pain that I should immediately go to a liquid diet again, but also that I would immediately need to stop drinking alcohol completely and that I should be aware that drinking alcohol would do one of two things either kill me or give me type one diabetes. Neither of which sounded really good options to me. So, yes, at that point, I stopped drinking alcohol completely and have not had any recurrence of that. And my assumption is that I still have the possibility of it, but I haven't had any problem.So apparently stopping alcohol is what what made me not have it keep bothering me, even though, wait, it didn't bother me at all in the first place.

Therefore the cat and the father are both up in the tree and neither of them can get down.The little girl is crying because she wants her cat.

That may include the jar, peanut butter, jelly, if you want jelly on it, the bread, you must select whether you want the whole wheat bread or white bread. You might select other ingredients that you would like to put on the sandwiches, such as raisins or bananas or nuts, whatever else. So you arrange all your ingredients. Then you take out your slices of bread and spread them with the peanut butter.The next step would be the jelly, if you want the jelly on. And then you pile on the other ingredients. Put the two slices you spread with the peanut barrel one slice of bread. And then you put the two slices together and cut the sandwich either in half or diagonally and put it on a plate.

And poor Cinderella stuck at home doing the chores until that nice old fairy godmother comes along and waves a wand and she ends up dressed to be all and ready to ride in a carriage. It's fancy as it can be to the castle or the palace and has a good night on the town. There was, of course, one stipulation. She had to, I think, be out of there by midnight or something like that.In the interim, she had to run off. For some reason or other. She had danced, I guess, with the prince and made a pretty good impression on him.So she ends up having to flee the place and he loses track of her, except I believe she had thrown a shoe, if you would, a slipper, and that was his only contact with her. As it evolves, he cast about his domain and goes around trying to find the young lady that the tiny slipper fits. And lo and behold, it turns out to be Cinderella.

        "transcript": "Me, the first thing I'm doing would be to go to the pantry and make sure I have peanut butter. My favorite peanut butter can be of any brand, but I like the chunky style because I eat a lot of peanuts, I eat a lot of almonds. I just eat them for the nutritional value. So I do eat considerable peanut butter. From a sandwich standpoint, it's a little bit different for me to even think of eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich because I usually eat most of my peanut butter on salting crackers.But in the case that I am really hungry and I'm not just eating a snack, then I would, after locating my peanut butter, place it out on the counter. I will then go and find some bread. Sometimes I keep my bread in the refrigerator so it doesn't mold so quick. And if I had done that, I will usually toast the bread because I don't like it to be cold when I eat it. Otherwise I may have taken it off the counter.For my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread because that would give me the extra flavor of the crust. So once I located my bread, I now have my peanut butter. I would go to my drawer where I keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife or a dinner type knife and begin spreading the peanut butter onto the bread. What I like to do this is where the jelly messes you up, is that when I make I usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of the well on one side, but on both slices of bread. In this case, I have to go and alter my pine and have them put the peanut butter only onto one piece of bread, and I would use the jelly on the other.Now, since I don't have a whole lot of jelly in my house, I do keep at least one bottle or jar, whatever you call it, in my refrigerator. And it'll usually always be strawberry because I dislike strawberry and it's a good default jelly. So after I got that out of the refrigerator, I would do the same with that, spreading it onto one slice of bread and then smashing them together and eating it and enjoying."

And very different part of France than you usually think of because it's in the low country.So it's much more like Holland or Belgium up there. And in terms of architecture, in terms of the people, they're much, much less stereotypical French people up there. In other words, let me give you an example. In France, in Paris, and certainly in southern France, people are very loath to wait in line. People cut in line, they end up in this great big, huge mob instead of lines.And it's frustrating for people who are line standards by nature, which Americans tend to be and British tend to be.

So it was much, much wider than normal avenues, even avenues are in French cities. So it was spacious and beautiful. And I made friends.We did wonderful. A lot of traveling at that point, a lot of traveling in France, but also in other countries in Europe, because that was John's job, partly. We went to England a lot. Went to Denmark, Spain, germany. Not really.I forget why. We didn't go to Germany very much. But anyhow, it was amazing. And my French got extremely good, much better than it had been.

They really thought that the prince was going to fall in love with one of the stepsisters, even though they may have been fooling themselves a little bit about this. And the next day, it was put about in the city that the king needed to find the owner of this shoe, because the prince would never be happy without her. So the prince's servant carried around a pillow with the glass slipper on it and walked around to all the houses in the land to have each woman who had been to the ball try on the slipper to see if it would fit. And apparently, nobody actually looked at Cinderella to see what she looked like, so they could try to find her that way, but that's how it often happens in fairy tales.So finally they came to the house of the gentleman and his new wife, and the stepsisters and Cinderella and the stepsisters were convinced that all they had to do was fit into that shoe, and they were willing to do anything to fit into that shoe. And we will not go into details about how they did that, but there is Cinderella kind of sitting there in a corner, and the prince's servant looks around and sees her and says, shouldn't this one try? The stepmother says ho. Ho. How ridiculous.It can't possibly be her. And Cinderella comes out, sits down, puts on the shoe. It fits perfectly. And not only that, she has the other one and puts that on her feet.

Strawberry, grape, whatever kind. And then you're going to open up the bag of bread.You don't want to get the first slice. Get the slices after that, and you lay them flat like this. And if you're like me, you're going to cut the crust off first with the knife. But just don't take any of the actual bread off, just the crust. And then you're going to take that knife, and you're going to dip it in the jar of peanut butter.Get some peanut butter out of that knife and smooth it over the bread. Just one slice. And then you're going to take that same well, no, you're going to get a spoon, and then you're going to scoop some jelly out, and you're going to dump it on the other slice of bread that you didn't put the peanut butter on. And you're going to smooth it over that slice of bread.

So she left the stepmom, and the stepmom was evil and made her do all the chores and the stepsisters. And one night, the Princess Kingdom was having a ball, and Disney Prince and the stepsisters were going with the stepmother, but Cinderella wasn't allowed to go because she had to do some magic mice and made her this beautiful dress, but it got ruined by, I think, the cat or something. And so she cried because she couldn't go to the ball anymore. And then the fairy godmother appeared and made her this wonderful dress and turned the pumpkin into the carriage and all of her mice and her mortise and took her to the ball.But she had to be home by midnight because the spell would be broken. And while she was at the ball, she met the prince, and they danced all night, and they fell in love. But she had to leave at midnight. And as she was leaving, she left her glass slipper on the stairs, just one of them. And the prince wanted to try and find her, so he demanded his third person to take the glass slipper and try it on all of the girls in the kingdom.When they came to Cinderella's house, her stepmom locked her up in a tower room or something.Prince couldn't find anyone who fits this glass slipper. And somehow she got out of her room. I think the mice got a key or something, got her out of her room. And when she went downstairs trying the shoe, remember, the slipper broke, but she had another slipper and tried it on, and it fit, and then she made a sense, and it was halfway up there after actually had someone tell me the story the other day, and she knew every character's name. Oh, my.That's not normal.All right, so now we're going to look at some pictures. I'd like for you to take a look at these pictures, and I'm going to leave them out while you're telling the story. But they do tell a story. I want you to take a look at all of them and then tell me a story with the beginning, middle and an end, and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. Okay?"

So one time a few years ago, I was working probably harder than what I should have and should have taken a break when I didn't listen to my body and just kept working and working and working. And then then I developed a bit of a cough and I ignored it and kept going. Going. Because, of course, why would I take time to go to the doctor?And then my cough got worse, and I developed a fever. And the cough changed. I don't know how to explain it, but it became really painful. And I don't know, it sounded different. I can't explain how it sounded different, but it did.And so I started really kind of feeling awful. I think it started off with having the chills. And so I filled up our bathtub with really hot water and took a nice long bath. And that still didn't quite warm me up. And then I went and tried to sleep, and that didn't work.And then I finally because I don't like to use medicine so much, but then I finally decided, okay, I should probably take some kind of fever medication. So I tried to get my fever down. Still coughing, coughing, coughing. Lots of pain in the chest. And then I realized I can't go to school tomorrow because I'm clearly sick, so I have to call in.And I don't hardly ever call in sick. But then I had to do it because I thought, well, I could be contagious. So I decided that I would try to listen to my body and go to sleep. But it was too late for that. So just sleeping isn't going to work.And so I went to the doctor and I went and had them. They did X rays because they could hear my coughing and then found out that I had pneumonia. So I thought, oh, well done, Howell. So they had to give me I don't remember, some kind of medication. And then after the medication, I began to feel better.And for a while, I actually listened to my body when I started getting these signs that I should slow out and take a break. How is that?"

So as her whitewater and the further down they got, the rougher the water became.And as they continued to go down, the water got so rough that her life vest fell out of the boat. And seconds later, the boat tipped over. So both of them are in the water with the rapids hitting rocks, with the heavy flow of the stream going by them. Fortunately, the man, since he had floated, he was able to stay afloat and last long enough to float to the edge and grab a branch. His girlfriend was coming quickly behind him, and as he's hanging onto the branch, he's reaching for her.Early one morning, it's time for Little Johnny to go to school. Little Johnny's about to walk out the door, but mom stops him and says, johnny, you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast and I think it's going to rain. Johnny says, oh, Mom, I don't need an umbrella. Umbrellas are for sissies. And besides, a little bit of rain isn't going to hurt me.She says, I think you should take it. No, I don't need it. I'll see you later. Mom says. Johnny is walking to school.It starts to rain at first a little bit and then harder and harder. And as Johnny is walking, he's putting his hands over his head, trying to stop all the wetness from falling on his face. And he's hating himself for not having to get that umbrella. So he races back home. He races back home, and when his mom opens the door, he's soaking wet.And his mom looks at him disappointedly and said, see, you're all wet because you didn't take the umbrella. Maybe next time you'll listen to me. So Johnny took the umbrella and went outside while it was still raining. And this time he used it. And he figured, hey, I guess umbrellas aren't for sissies after all."

And my brother, who's a doctor in Lexington, called me and told me that if I wanted her to know me, that I perhaps ought to consider coming home on emergency leave. Though I was due to be home about eight months, seven, eight this later. So I did do that.I came home on emergency leave and visited with her. And at the time, she could give yes and no answers, but it was very difficult for her to construct a sentence at that time. And then I wasn't around her every day, not even really every month. I was off in the service and my dad basically was the caregiver. And she just slowly would go down and it would be kind of a plateau.I would get down to see her and eventually she got to the point where she couldn't say anything and you never really know. You try to talk to her about how she's doing, some experience that the kids are having or something like that. And at first you thought she maybe was relating to it, but later you really didn't know whether it was getting through at all. And this was about 1980, and then about five years later, four and a half so years later, my dad had coped with everything for that time. It about killed him because he was approaching 80.He thought it was time for it to go into a nursing home. And my brother and I went down to town from up here. I was up in Scott County at the time, but my brother's here in Lexington, we drove down and we're going to help him get her into the nursing home because he just couldn't do it. And my brother being the doctor, he didn't want to say anything or tell her anything either, which was strange, I thought. So I said to the mom, I said, It's time that we took you out and put you in the nursing home.And the strangest thing, I could not believe her, but she stood straight up and was ready to go. I think she would finally and she knew what I had seen."

He wasn't paying attention. Cinderella had to have fun.Then the community decided to have a ball because they had a prince that needed a woman. And so everybody was going to go to the ball except Cinderella because she's cleaning girl and she has to clean the fire ashes out of the fireplace, et cetera. So of course we're back to manifesting. Cinderella knows how to manifest. So she manifested the fairy godmother.The fairy godmother has a wand and she's going to create a dress and wonderful glasses for the girl but we don't tell anybody because she'd get locked up and not be allowed to go. While the sisters who aren't the most conventionally attractive girls go to the ball, cinderella gets to go when the fairy godmother makes her pumpkin into a carriage. And so she goes to the ball because she's got this glow about her because not everything is of this earth. And he decides that this is the one he chooses but has to be home before midnight because he's going to return to his gullible maid and the pumpkin is going to lose its wheels and the horses will end up being mice again. And so that's what happens.And she barely makes it home in time to serve breakfast the next morning.

She's a lovely, absolutely lovely woman, and we ended up getting divorced.However, after my divorce, I went to a thing at seminar at a place called Landmark Education, and I learned about it was a weekend seminar start on Friday morning and went through Sunday night. There's about 125 of us there. There was about 15 men and 100, some OD women mostly. Maybe not exactly that, but it was that kind of proportion. And I had felt very kind of down after my divorce, and I had prayed, and this was kind of the Lord leading me to this session.So I listened, and I listened a lot, and the conversation dealt with abandonment. And it turns out that in summary, I think most women I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do. And I learn very significant things about abandonment and how people feel and learned that you have to forgive an abandonment. But I also learned that which this was reinforced I was told by a priest back in the 70s that when your wife speaks to you, just listen, and what you remember is one or two things is what's important, don't solve every problem. Well, this reinforced that.And women have a that's why if you go back that story, I might have said this women have a need. Men do too, but they don't verbalize it. But women verbalize it a lot more. When things build up after day, they have a need to come home and dump. They do.And they need somebody to listen. They don't need any dialogue on it or not, but they need somebody to listen. So I learned to just sit and listen. And what I remembered from it is then afterwards, after partner is finished, what you remember one or two things. You talk about that, and then your partner is pleased because then that shows that you've listened to them, and that makes them more effective communication."

She was like an office manager secretary, but whatever, she just kind of get on with it. And over time, she just kind of talked a little bit slower and would use shorter sentences. And of course, she had the arguing with my dad dynamic going on, so she pretty much tried to hide it for it was they didn't really diagnose it for a while.And then she went to University of Michigan where they have this neurology or aphasia center, some type of where they do a lot of research in it. Thing is, she didn't like the doctor and she told him to buck off and whatever, so didn't really get the whole research thing on it, but over time, she just got less and less communicative. They thought she was having many strokes for a while. And what really got her pissed off was it was actually the evening of her sister's funeral. They went out to dinner and she passed out, and they rushed her to the hospital.And the doctor well, the strange thing when they rushed to the hospital after she woke up that evening, she was talking perfectly normal. I mean, it had gone away. She full sentences and as if she'd nothing happened. I take the clock back ten years. She went to bed that night, she woke up, and then she was back to where she was before it happened, so no one could figure that one out.But meanwhile, the doctor pulled her driver's license because she passed out and considered a seizure or something, and that really pissed her off. And she took her my dad had to take away the keys. She actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up. And we actually kept her car until she died. She couldn't sell her car because when you get better, mom, you can have her car back.But eventually she ended up losing muscle control and she was working with a walker. And then within a year after that, she was in a wheelchair. She was in the nursing home for about the last year and a half. And when she went in the nursing home, she could still speak three or four sentence three or four word sentences, and towards the end, she could get one or two words out. But the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time, and then eventually she died.She just decided she was not going to eat, and she didn't eat and the last that was it."

I was in the hospital with surgery within four days.Was in the hospital ten days, had skin grafts, losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer. The skin grafts were taken from my left hip.I don't know which was worse pain, the wound and back or the skin grafts on my hip. But you can't hardly get comfortable in bed. You just sleep under lights that dry up the skin wounds. And then I was out of the hospital. I was back at work within six weeks with still the sort of a semi open room over my spine in the back, which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years.In order to close the wound on the back, they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar, take the flaps of skin, close them back over the original scar wound.I had, for about six weeks, a lump on my back where they were in flowing saline blooms every week so that I would grow my own skin for the repair. That was done. And I had ten years with an oncologist, and now I have a queen bill of health. So that's about all I can remember."

Bad sore throat Friday night, slept all day Saturday, slept all day Sunday and felt like crap, but a little bit better. Went to work Monday and then still kind of felt tired the rest of the rest of the week. And that was swine flu. So it wasn't as trum manic as I thought it would be, but still felt like crap."

And all I knew was I couldn't stand up. And it was right about the time my father came home from work.And my mother said, well, just stay down there. Your dad will be him in a few minutes. So sure enough, he came by in about five minutes from work. My mother told him I fell off the porch and I can't stand up. So he checked and said, well, you got a broken leg.Oh, my God. So he picked me up and put me in the car and drove me over to the clinic at that time. And I remember being on an examining table and he had taken an x ray picture, and he showed me where the brake was. And I said, well, you're going to be able to fix that? And he said, oh, yeah, sure.It'll be all right. But I wasn't sure if I believed him or not. So he said, well, first we're going to put a cast on your leg. So he got a bucket and some plaster of Paris and water and mixed it all up. I'm sitting there with my eyes big as saucers, wondering, what is he going to do to me?And sure enough, he stretched the leg out and reached in the bucket of plaster of Paris and formed it all around my leg, from my knee down to my ankle, and said I should come back. And I can't remember several weeks. And my father carried me out to his car again, put me in the seat, drove home, and of course, I couldn't hobble too much. And I said, Well, I got a wagon, so I'll just live in the wagon. So that's what I did.Whenever I wanted to go anywhere or play or do anything, I would always have one leg I could stick out the side and propel myself. And sure enough, we went back to the burden of the clinic and they checked me over and said, okay, time. I take the cast off. And he reached in the drawing and pulls out this electric saw, which was again more terrifying than making up a bucket full of plaster of Paris. I think it was going to cut my leg, and it buzed and it cut into the plaster of Paris, and you could hear it grinding away.The next thing I know, he holds up two halves. Here's your cash. You have it as a souvenir. So I said, wow, that's great. That's cool.So I took it home and kept it for many joints he'll find."

Now I'd like you to take a look at this series of pictures.They tell a story and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. The beginning. There is young lad outside playing soccer, playing around, looks like by himself. Middle of the story is the soccer ball goes through the window into the family room of a neighbor. I'm going to call it a neighbor who was very surprised.End of the story is once again the neighbor decides to keep the ball and does not go after the little boy. The end. So here are some more pictures that tell a story. Please take a look at all of them. And then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.The beginning of the story, the little boy is heading out to school. I see a backpack on his back and mom hands him an umbrella to let him know that it's getting ready to rain. Will be raining somewhere during the day. I assume he attended class and was walking home. Middle of the story is in the way home he gets drenched.It starts raining and he is soaking wet. End of the story is he's a little perturbed that his mom was correct and moral of the story at the end is he took his umbrella with him. Next time he went out. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.I would say the beginning of the story is the little girl was out riding her bicycle when she happened to notice that her cat had climbed the tree and had gotten stuck. Middle of the story I would say dad came up and decided he was going to try to help out the kitty cat and he as well got stuck. End of the story would be the fire department was called to come rescue both of about being."

But because of that inability to communicate on the same point, which they really understood was the saddest thing, communication never developed. Two years after the man was fired, the captain, he came back to that area by himself, his wife, and his children, and he made a personal apology to everybody, which made the US. Government even more hungry.So I still remember this day thinking the US. Wanted to keep Japan as friends, the Japanese wanted to keep the US. As friends. But what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble. Stupid.When my wife was seven months pregnant, we got news from her family that her mother in law was dying of intestinal cancer. We were living away from them at the time. We were living in Japan. Excuse me? We were living in Germany, but they were back home in Japan.My wife's pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy, and it was her first child, so I had to go back to represent her in the Japanese mine. Anyway, for my wife and I to see the mother in law in a period of three months, I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about.The biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died. Because I knew the mother was going to die. I talked to the doctor, but the father didn't know. They kept that information from the father. They didn't want to tell him.I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying. The mother didn't know she was dying. So I was afraid that my wife couldn't get home. The sense of being afraid or scared is, I lost my father while living in Hungary, and I will never be able to answer that question of what if? So that, to me, is a scared situation that I clearly remember.Okay?"

She gets in the carriage and the carriage had already disintegrated, she was sitting on a little pumpkin. Ultimately she gets home, back to wherever she was working. I'm assuming she was some kind of a maid or something.Anyway, then it appears as the prince's father or his servant came over with a slipper and he was searching for whoever the slipper would fit. And he tried the other sisters or made or other people that lived in the house. I forget now whether it was her sisters or whether he was just or she was just a maid for them. And she tried all them and it didn't work. So then finally he looked at Cinderella and tried it on Cinderella and it fit her foot.So then whoever the servant was, he rushed her off, she run to the prince, she got all dressed up again and they got married and lived happily ever after."

And so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across. What I do is I offer her extra time.Sometimes extra processing time helps. Sometimes we can do a panamime with if it's an object, maybe we can pull the object like a cell phone or whatever. Sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a little better than actually finding the word in her mind, but visualizing it. And then because we lived with each other and we're together so much, I can kind of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs. Like today, I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring.And I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card. So for the most part, I can kind of guess. So. A little bit like Vanna White. Is it this?Is it that does it begin with the letter? Sometimes beginning letters help. So that's how we work it out.My husband and I were in Washington, DC. Doing some sightseeing. And it turned when we came off a boat trip. It got a little darker and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel. And so we were walking along.It was pretty isolated street. There wasn't a lot of people around. We're trying to get to a bus stop or a station. And as we were walking, we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us maybe 20 yards back. And it was three young kids, three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough.And so I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing. And my husband said, if they come after us, I'm going to take the movie camera. And I'll hit them, and you run like hell. So we were picking up the pace. As we picked up the pace, they picked up the pace.And as we turned the corner, there was a bus station and people were waiting there. So we were just so grateful to see other people.

So she wanted to go to the ball, but she was too busy. Her stepmother said, you can go if you get everything done for everybody else because they all had to have their clothes cleaned and ready to go. So she started to get everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball.And in the meantime, her friends, the mice, put soda dress together for her and got her all set that she could go to the ball. Once she got everybody off and going, she can then get ready and go. But the sisters found out and they tore up her dress and she thought she'd never get to the ball. And then she met her fairy godmother. She went out in the yard and was crying, and the fairy godmother came.And the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the mice into horses and the dog into a horseman and gave her a beautiful dress and sent her off to the ball but told her that she needed to be home by leave by 12:00 midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point. So she went off to the ball and she met the prince, and they fell in love. And all of a sudden she heard the clock chiming, twelve midnight. So she had to run out and she ran down the steps of the castle and left the prince. And she lost her shoe on the way.So the prince thought he would never see this girl again. And so the next day, the father and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that this shoe fit on. And that was Cinderella.

Another milestone was getting a job at Montclair State.I was a speech clinician doing work as a speech language pathologist. But I missed interacting with students.I had some experience in doing that because my undergraduate degree was in history and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that, but then things sort of changed, obviously, but I missed that kind of interaction. I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician, and Marie was teaching English at the high school level, and she would come back home with stories about working with students and discussions they had in class. And I was sort of jealous of that. And so when I was invited to become an instructor here, I jumped at the chance. And that changed everything.And I was warned that from friends, colleagues, that I was taking a big risk in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure, that I was going to be taken advantage of. I don't know where they got the idea, but that I would work for X number of years. And when it came time for tenure, I wouldn't get tenure. But I wanted to be in the classroom so much, and it was more that than doing research, actually. It was actually teaching that drew me to it, that I said, Heck with it, I'm going to do it.And so I did, and that changed everything. And that was a very, very positive event.And I spent 45 years after that and being here."

We've lived all over the country and our lives have kind of paralleled each other until when I was in Massachusetts and she was in Virginia. So anyway, we would meet once a year. We both now well, we were always married when we knew each other.And now we have kids and kids. They were middle school age. We started these girls weekends and it became an annual thing. And typically we went to Philadelphia. We would drive or fly into Philadelphia, and we met there or sometimes Baltimore.And they would always start. The first night would be like up late, which every time we said, we're not going to do it because it always killed our first full day together. But we'd be up late and we would just drag the hotel chairs in front of a window and wine. And we would pack cheese and crackers and grapes. Whoever drove packed whatever they could.The other person would pick up a bottle of wine from the liquor store on the way in. Anyway, we would sit the evening and catch up. And then the next day we would get up and have a delicious breakfast out or just a cup of coffee, and then we would go. In Philadelphia, there was this first time which then became a tradition. We stumbled upon the store we couldn't figure out.The lighting was a little weird. The flooring was a little off. Anyway, it turned out to be a great consignment shop. And unbelievable clothes. I mean, like just unbelievable clothes.We would spend hours in there. We would try on and we'd go home bags, and then we'd bring those back to the hotel. And then we'd go out for our happy hours somewhere. And then we'd go out for dinner. No kids, no cooking.And then sometimes on some of the weekends, we would do typically the weekend enough was too expensive, so we would just do like a treatment, like a facial somewhere. The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became. So we'd go for like, a facial or something. And then on Sunday, we would always go out for a breakfast again.

Anyway, it was a 16 bed, short term crisis unit, so two weeks or more, and they either pulled their act together or they got shipped off to Capitol District psychiatric center. So that was a huge motivation for them to be earnest in their endeavors. So it was a mental health population.So depending on the diagnosis and where they were that day depended on how communicative they could be or chose to be.We had all sorts, and depending on their age and depending on their diagnosis and depending what was happening, there was a certain percentage of population that were chronically mentally ill. So we did have repeat people, not all old, a lot, late 80s. So a lot of the psych hospitals were starting to close down if they had been compliant with their meds. So we did a lot of listening, a lot of urging, sometimes just quietly sitting with them. And sometimes that was the best thing not to talk at all, just try to quiet the chatter if they were hallucinating medication, we did I think in my time there, I did have two people that were actually catatonic.That was very fascinating to watch that, because so we had individual therapy, we had group therapy, and then basically every interaction on the unit was a therapy per se, just sitting around the coffee table, the coffee table, kitchen table, while they were they could smoke at the kitchen table. It was a nightmare. I've never been a smoker. It was horrible. Anyway, so we would try to just watch for that individual's cues and just follow them.The."

But he couldn't get any farther. And the ladder, he ended up, by accident, pushing the ladder down. Thank goodness the ladder didn't hit Annie.But meanwhile, Annie's still very upset. So somebody, perhaps her mom, called the fire department, and so the fire department, the firefighters, have brought their truck along with what looks like about the same size ladder, and they're going to help either the dad or the cat out of the tree, although perhaps both. My guess is the cat can get out of the tree anytime she wants to.My guess is, once they help the dad out of the tree, then they will go in the house, something nice to drink, and the cat will come down on her own. And the dog, especially if they get the dog back in the house with them so that he can stop barking at everybody. So I think that's what's going to happen. The dad got down from the tree, they went in the house. The cat casually climbed back down out of the tree and disappeared behind the house.The end."

And so the difficulty she had communicating was remembering what she had just said and remembering what she wanted to say. And so I was not living with her, I saw her once a month, she was living with her sister and so I didn't have the brunt of the difficulty my aunt did. And so what I ended up doing when I came to visit was primarily trying to support my aunt in her supporting of my mom. But what I discovered one time I had to stay with my mom while my aunt was in the hospital and I was finding it very frustrating and difficult.What I discovered is that if I was really frustrated and having a hard time kind of doing what I needed to do, if I would ask her about her childhood, I could get all kinds of fabulous stories and she remembered lots and was able to tell me stuff that I hadn't heard before, which was wonderful. And later on after my mom died, my aunt ended up with just age, just very old. By this time she was 92 or three and was very hard to communicate with because she basically didn't follow what you were saying and couldn't really understand necessarily. And so what we did then I say we because it was me and my cousins, her children basically just tried to tell her that listen to her when she wanted to say something she would tell jokes, which just used to just amaze me that she would tell was crazy. She always loved goofy, dumb jokes, and so she would continue to tell those, and so we enjoyed that, and we made sure she knew that, and we just tried to reassure her about who she was and where she was and who we were.And sometimes she had moments of clarity and sometimes she didn't, and we just had to keep up with her, whatever she was doing."

And so when he was little, you really couldn't understand what he was saying.He had to take speech classes when he started going to school because he really couldn't understand what he said. So you had to just try to go by either what he was pointing at or his body language to try and figure out he was saying. But now that he's had the speech classes, you can understand him a lot better. Now, let's see. I was driving down the street with my kids in my car and my husband, and we were stopped at a traffic light, and I happened to look up into the rear view mirror and saw a van coming at us.And everybody else was stopped and the van was still coming. So I got scared because I knew we were going to get hit by that van. So I put my foot on the brake to try to keep the car from sliding forward when the guy in the van hit us, which he did hit us. And we did go forward. We had some shaved ice, and when he hit us, the shaved ice flew all over inside the car.And I had stopped the car, put the brake on, and so we didn't hit the car in front of us, luckily, but we were very scared. We got out of the car and the guy took off. And so we just pulled into the next place and called the police and waited for the police to show up.Okay. It looks to me like in this picture, it looks like that there was some bad weather, a lot of rain, maybe some flooding, and it looks like a lady might have got have been in a car and either got out of her car to try to get out and get out of the water or whatever, and she was floating down the river and got trapped or stopped by a tree branch. It and someone on the side may have looked and seen and called the paramedics or 911. And there is a firefighter trying to rescue her and he is trying to get a belt around her to get her out of the water. And it looks like he's having a hard time rescuing her."

And one day, they found out that there was going to be a ball at the castle. And so the stepsisters had their dresses made, but Cinderella couldn't go because she was a maid.She didn't have a dress. So her fairy godmother decided that Cinderella needed to go to the castle and be happy. So she waved her wand, made her a dress oh, my goodness. It was beautiful.Did her wand, and made the pumpkin into a beautiful coach. And she rode into the castle with a beautiful dress and glass slippers and saw the prince.

So he was the second child. The first child spoke kind of she was a big pointer in one worder, princess, until, like, her second birthday. So second child, I really didn't have high expectations for early speech.He spoke so much more. He spoke incessantly, and it was such garbled speech. She never spoke. He spoke all the time. When she finally spoke, it was crystal clear articulation and pronunciation, and he just never stopped talking.And nobody knew I knew what he was saying. His sister knew who was for what he was saying, but nobody else could understand. So at his second checkup, I brought it to the pediatricians. While he's a boy, let's give him a little bit more time. So in between that time, I would just stare.I had a stare at his lips and his eyebrows, the expression. He was so demonstrative in this constant chatter. And myself and my daughter, his sister, were the only two who could understand it. My husband would come home from work, and he would smile and nod, and he would give the shifty eye, and I'd be, like, explaining everything that he was saying so that Bruce would then interact with him. And then his second birthday was in February.That checkup was February. He went back for May, and the pediatrician was like, he's definitely just I have no idea what he's saying. So meanwhile, the whole time, he had fluid in his ears, and he had constant ear infections. But this was our first year with this pediatrician. We had moved from Michigan to Massachusetts.So anyway, we get referred to an ENT and to a speech pathologist. Speech language pathologist. And we go and we see the ENT. Yes, he has chronic fluid in his ears. So I said, okay.And he went to see an audiologist. Are you an audiologist?"

When he had the therapy at Community Outpatient Services, one of the therapists there made him a communication book in which he could point to a picture and show me what he wanted. And that should have worked, but it didn't. He just didn't really want to use it. So now we have lived together for about two and a half years without hardly any vocal communication from Ted other than what I told you.But I have sort of figured out what Ted wants most of the time, and I can usually ask him, do you want drops? Do you want a face? Want are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you cold?Do you want a jacket? And he can tell me yes or no. Recently, we have tried something else called well, it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles, and I put them into letter boxes for him to see if that might work, if he could make some words to show me what he wanted. And we have had a very limited success with that.But I would not say it's the magic bullet. Ted can make a simple word if I ask him to, such as cheese. What kind of sandwich do you want? Cheese or bacon or what do you want to drink? And he will sometimes write juice with the letter tiles.Only on two occasions, though, has he been able to take the letter tiles and tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out. So I don't know if we can make that work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it 10,000 times. But most it's just Ted can indicate that he wants something.And then I ask him, do you need the urinal or do you want to take a nap? Or are you hungry? Are you telling me I should make supper? And you can tell me yeah or no? So that's pretty much how we communicate."

And if it's the wintertime, I get on my jacket and winter shoes and I would go around the block for a walk, a cup, two, three times.Arms, especially when it's colder, you kind of have to cut the walks short.

It's just something I got used to and it works really well for me. But I drink really good coffee and but brown sugar. I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant.So I'll walk to work. It's about a twelve minute walk, twelve to 15 minutes walk, depending on the weather. And then when I get there, I'll have another half a cup of coffee. Well, maybe almost a full cup, but with brown sugar again. And then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative tasks to get done.And you check your email and voicemail and all these other things that are not chargeable time in the firm. So administration consumes a lot of time. And by then it's 08:00.

And she must have been a real cat lover, because there were stray cats everywhere around the outside the house, inside the house, the carpets just ripped of cat urine, the walls were crumbling, the plaster was cracked, there was water damage everywhere. I guess she'd let the windows open and the rain had come in and the place was an absolute wreck. So anyways, we did a little bit of renovations, but we haven't done much since then. That was 25 years ago.So, anyways, we hired somebody to put together some plans and stuff like that, and hired a contractor. And at the moment, what's happening is that the contractor and the architect are arguing and fighting being really difficult, extremely difficult to get along with. So they're arguing about everything.

I'd like for you to take a look at these pictures, and they tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. So whenever you're ready, just go ahead and tell me that story.This mom is telling her son to take an umbrella with him to school, but he doesn't feel like he needs it. He leaves it, realizes that it's raining, and then it starts to rain a little bit harder, so he goes back to his mom. His mom is a little bit angry at him, or just a little bit, I guess just angry Adam, for not taking the umbrella, and he finally decides to take the umbrella with him to school. Okay, great. So now I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.You can see there's a lot going on here, but together, it tells a story. So I'd like for you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.So it looks like the little girl was playing on her tricycle and probably noticed the cat that was stuck in the tree. And then the man that is in the tree probably came by and was either trying to help get the cat out of the tree, or the dog chased him up the tree and was earth because he was trying to bite him or the combination of the two. And then he probably decided, since the girl was looks to be really young, to call the fire department to help them get the cat out of the tree as well as himself."

And you do have a short window if it's the same as a stroke, in my case, there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong, and and you do have time to be cognizant of being in big trouble. In fact, I remember one time I fainted. I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house, and I was really afraid of the fact that I was in a hard tile room and my daughter was downstairs.I guess she was maybe around seven or eight. And I just in a panic. I said, Dolly, call 911. So I knew I was in trouble, and then I was able to just slowly go down myself, and then I went out of the picture, and the paramedics did take me to the hospital, and I had food poisoning. And when I got now, that was really frightening.As they're racing me through the Er, they're asking me all sorts of information, and the pocketbook disappears, and then testing and monitors and all that, and they said, Your potassium level is in the basement. And you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either in the hospital or even dying. And they told me, yeah, when the potassium levels go down to those sort of sub levels, organs can start shutting down rather quickly. So it was truly an emergency situation, and my daughter, as young as she was, know, I credit Natalie with, you know, the fact that it wasn't worse, that she she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed 911. Yeah.So I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice, I think, right?"

And then I open up a jar of jelly.And I usually use a spoon for that. Put that on the other slice of bread. Take the same knife that I used to serve peanut butter, spread it over the bread and put the two slices together. A little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike and noticed that her cat was caught up in the tree.Her father came along and said, what is it, dear? He says, dad, my cat's in the tree. Well, I can get the cat out. Let me go get my ladder. Father went and got the ladder, climbed up the tree, and then a neighborhood dog came by and noticed a man up in the tree and started barking at the man up the tree and accidentally knocked down the ladder.So the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat, and the fire department had to be called to rescue them both. I guess about seven years ago, I really hurt my back. There's this family that I go and visit that has a little child. And from the time that child was born, it's a little boy. I always picked him up and swung him around.But as this boy was getting older, as I was getting older, I guess I can't do some of the things that I normally do. This particular time, I picked a boy up and I was swinging him around, swinging, picking him up by the arms, and I spread my legs wide open, and I was swinging him backwards and forwards, and I felt something snap in my back. I was in excruciating pain. I almost dropped a kid.I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids. But this was pain like I have never felt before. Because even just to walk or roll over in a bed, to move a leg, even to move your arms, it's all tied into the back. It would be like a knife was twisting. So that's injury and it put me out of commission for a couple of weeks."

Susie came up to me and said, mother, something is wrong with Grandma.And we had noticed a little bit, but it just got worse and worse. And then my mom and dad were in a sister living out in Fountain Hills. Then we lost dad. So we put mom into a nursing home up in Flagstaff, where my sister lives. And she was up there for four years.And at first she could talk. She went through all the different stations of aggression and meanness. And she would call me, or dad would actually, because she couldn't really dial, but dad would call and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes, and she was much thinner than I was or taking money. Dad would call and hiding in the garage. And this mother, who's maybe 110 pounds at the most, he was kind of frightened of her because she got really mean.But then she got back into a very calm state and slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever. But I learned, and dad and I went to an Alzheimer's support group, which really, really helped us, especially dad, because my mama did everything. She had been the one to do all the shopping, send out the cards. And I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards. But finally there was a point where when dad died, that she needed full care.And the last six months, she couldn't talk or do anything, and she broke her hip, had a fall. And the saddest thing was that up until the last year, she was very physically, very healthy. So she died at age 87."

And if they feel they're going to get better, they will. So when I was in the hospital on my mother's birthday in June, I had asked one of the nurses, will I ever be myself again?

And I just didn't think that if I don't help myself, I'll never get out of here or always stay in this condition. And she would leave after she washed me up and sit me in the chair, and I would get in my chair, and I would because the chair had wheels on it, but it wasn't a wheelchair.I would just kind of try and move my legs, and she'd be like, Where are you going?

Like they asked questions for which the answer seemed obvious. Why would anybody say the obvious?So people said the obvious and they were rewarded. So those are the people sought after to be in the study groups, not me. So I did almost everything alone for the entire year. And when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes, she said she had to get permission from her group because they couldn't share notes outside the group. So I said thanks, but no thanks, don't bother.And somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't give a shit. Anybody who wanted to could be part of it. That was me. So I was part of that group for some classes. At the end of the year, in the subway station I met someone who I'm still friends with, who I just adore.But we had been divided into two groups of 50 or 75 people and she was in the other group, so I never saw her.

And there's a ladder there that's quite a ways from the tree.So I don't understand how it got that far away, but maybe it tipped over backwards. And then there's a dog, probably their dog, barking up the tree. Why? I have no idea what dogs do. And then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree.And then evidently somebody called fire department, and there's a fire truck and there's a couple firemen carrying the ladder towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there. But maybe it's not a good enough one. And that's pretty much it. So evidently father climbed up the tree to get the cat out, and for some reason, either the dog, the wind, or the father knocked the ladder down. And somebody, assumingly maybe the girl, called the fire department and they're responding and they're going to get him off.Looks like it's low enough he could just jump down. The thing was that I never had a heart attack, and other than having a very little chest pain, it was kind of somewhat of a surprise. So I had went and had electrocardiogram at my primary care physician, and he said that was all right, which they don't show anything anyway. He said he suggested a stress echo. So I had a stress echo and I went to it and I failed it.I was kind of shocked and I was going to do things afterwards. And I just called my wife and talked to her, and then I went home.

But I remember one time again living in my own home in Waukegan, my neighbor who was going to be my husband, but of course, I didn't even know that he rents out I call it a garage. It would have been a garage if it hadn't been designed as a small apartment to live in while the house was being built. So anyway, he rents out the garage and there's a Spanish speaking couple there. I don't speak any Spanish.And the lady comes over to my house and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself out of her house and she had to get to work. So I went over to her house and looked at the situation. And I didn't have any children that would fit through this tiny window. And I don't even remember if the kids were home. But then I took her down the street, two houses down to a family that Spanish and spoke Spanish.And so then we found out for sure what the problem was and I volunteered to take the lady to work. And that wasn't feasible because she had to have her ID, which was locked in the house. So then we went down the street further where I knew a slim child lived, and asked this child to help. But of course, he answered the door very cautiously and told us that he couldn't come out of the house because he's not allowed to come out of the house when mom and dad aren't home. Okay, well, when mom gets home, come and see us.So it wasn't too long. Mom came home, he comes up the street, he climbs in her little bitty window and opens the front door and end of story. Again."

So they got a cat.The cat, as cats are want to do, not super friendly, and decide to climb the tree because that's also what cats do.So out of the kindness of his heart, the dad tries to get up into the tree to rescue the cat, only to discover that he's not really qualified to do that.It's not his wheelhouse. In the meantime, his dog that he also didn't want, but they have anyway and is super attached to him, is trying to get him down so he can sit on his lap and all that kind of good stuff that dogs prefer. The daughter has been instructed to call for somebody to help, and so she does. And so the fire department arrives to get the cat out of the tree, even though she's still trying to get the cat to come down. It's not going to come down.So the firefighters arrive only to discover that not only do they have to rescue the cat, but they have to rescue this incompetent dad who bit off more than he could chew. Both in getting a dog that he didn't want, followed by getting a cat that he didn't want, and then getting stuck in a tree because he was too ambitious for his own good in trying to rescue the cat, Ultimately, because the firefighters were there with a ladder to get everybody down, they were able to do that.

But they gave me a screen test when we went. My mother and I went to California for my sister's wedding and the suggestion was made that I have a screen test, which I did. And when I came back and started my sophomore year in high school, they called and said they wanted me to come back, offered me so much money a week and so forth and so on.The interesting thing was making the movie with very interesting work. And I met lots of stars and I was in one movie with some of the biggest stars of the day. Bing Crosby was a friend. Bob Hope was a friend. And just the day to day activity, I had to take lessons.I had to go to school because I was 15, but I also had to take singing lessons. I had to take dancing lessons. They wanted me to get rid of my Southern accent as quickly as possible, which I think I did pretty well in those days. It's all come back, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. What I did not like and what eventually caused me to leave my contract was the control.They controlled your life. You could go where they said, you could do what they said, but you did not have the freedom to just come and go as you pleased. They had interviews planned and photo sessions planned and introductions planned and this sort of thing. And that rankled with me. I did not like being I mean, all my life I had done what I wanted to do, pretty much.So at any rate, the war was on and my sister, who had married, lived in Palm Springs, which was a base for air transport to the war zones. And I went down to visit her several times and met a man, fell in love and got married. And how much more of my life do you want to hear?"

Fortunately, the people in the other car were not particularly injured, although that was in the days of bench seats and woman driving. And her child were just pushed out the driver's side door and up onto a curb and they were fine. The not, the driver of our car was not hurt, but the other fellow who was riding in the middle and myself slammed into the windshield and broke the windshield. So that fellow in the middle got a number of cuts on his head and so forth.I had injury to my left hand and finger from, I think, reaching up and trying to pull him back and that nearly severed one finger and deeply cut another finger.

And after I jogged about a mile or a mile and a half, I first felt some tightness in my chest, difficulty in breathing, then kind of a tingling down my left arm. And I thought at the time that a heart attack was possible because I had heard of this, but I didn't think I was having a heart attack because it wasn't exactly what I thought a heart attack would be.So I slowed down and walked. I was pretty close to our house, and I walked into the house. My mother in law was there, so my wife was with her because she had Parkinson's and we were keeping her for six weeks. And so I just went on into the bedroom, took a shower. I was feeling better, a little weak, but not bad.So I laid down and I was watching that time the Bulls were in the playoffs and I'm a big Bulls fan, so I watched that. I went on and went to sleep. And I woke up at four in the morning and I was sweating profusely, and I could tell that my heart was beating very fast. So my wife took me to the hospital that was very close to our house. And I remember the doctor told me while he was taking the EKG, he says, Mr.Jacobs, you are having a heart attack right now. And that was pretty shocking to me because I was sitting up at the time and I didn't feel that bad. I knew something was wrong, but it wasn't what I thought a heart attack was. And so they immediately took me and put a balloon in and probably the best science class I ever had, because I was watching the monitor as they were doing this, and they put the balloon in and the doctor cardiologist said, and I'll watch it as we go up. And it went went up and said, okay, here's where the blockage is.And all of a sudden I could just see the blood just going right through as the balloon went up. It was wonderful, but not what I thought a heart attack would feel like."

We stayed with another sister up there and we had planned to stay that. We went up one Sunday afternoon. We went out to dinner that evening.The next day we had planned to stay all day long and come back on Tuesday sometime and just pot around up there with them, which we have done often before. And about 09:00 in the morning I got a telephone call from one of my sons here in town and he gave us the news that our eldest son had died in his sleep. Of course, that was a very traumatic and unbelievable thing. So I got this in one room and I had to walk in the other room and tell my wife. And that was very difficult.I've never had a more difficult time, I think, in saying anything except to say know, our son Jean died in his sleep. So we threw our clothes in the car and we took off for Lexington. And we got here as rapidly as we could to come back down here to see what was going on. He had been an epileptic, had found out when he was in his late 30s, early 40s that he was epileptic and he was taking medicine. And apparently he had had an epileptic seizure in his sleep and he died.And a few days later, three or four days later we had the funeral. And he's now buried at Calvary Cemetery here. And that's where we talked earlier about taking the dog in the car and going to the cemetery rides like that where we do that often throughout the week we go out. But that happened in 1991, so it's been quite a long time ago and we still think about it. Obviously, it's a very traumatic situation to lose a child out because in the general scheme of things it's been said that the parents ought to die before the children.But that doesn't always happen.

Neither one of us had ever climbed camelback mountain, so we didn't realize exactly where to go or where to start. We just picked a spot on the northern side of the mountain, walked in between some of those very expensive homes, and started climbing me. Little did we know we really had gotten ourselves in a lot of trouble doing that. There were times where we were actually hanging on to cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs just to get from one point to another.About halfway up, we're sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot. And I said to him, I says, man, there's no way we can go back the same way we came. And he says, I know. And I said I'm serious. He goes, so am i.And so we knew the only way the only thing we figured what we'd had to do is make it to the top, and hopefully there would be an easier way we come back on the other side, but then we would still have to hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car. To make a long story short, we were all scuffed up. We were tired, scratched up, clothes torn, but we could finally see where we were kind of getting to the top. As we were approaching the top, we saw more people up there and older people, younger people. And we couldn't believe it that all these people hadn't made it to the top when we had such a difficult time.So when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people, we asked them, how'd you get up here? They said, oh, we took this trail down here on the other side, and we couldn't believe that there was a trail. So after that experience, I thank god for helping us through it, because it really made me understand why people had to be rescued from camelback mountain, understand how people can get stuck, why helicopters have to come in and rescue people off of ledges. But prior to that experience, I couldn't understand how could people get to a certain place and not get back down the same way."

And gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying, you need to get here now.We need to figure this out. What's going on.

And I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again.And they took me to the emergency room and I had to stay in the emergency room for a little while, or wherever they take you, it was not in the recovery. They run me down the hallway.They were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that.So the next day I woke up and I was fine, and they got me walking around and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees. I did have some pain pills, but it wasn't morphine. And my knees, I was getting along fine without a walker and without a cane and all of that. Ten days after I had my knees replaced, I could walk, do whatever I wanted to do. I drove two weeks afterwards, and I've had very little problem with my knees since then, except they don't have a lot of strength in getting up out of this low chair that I'm sitting in right now.I'm going to have a half, so but my knee replacement was very successful. I would suggest anybody to have it done, but."

And my mother in law flew from Delaware to Boston, not really at my and call, but my then husband asked her to come and she wanted to be in the delivery room with me. And I did not want her to be there. At one point, she was massaging my feet and most likely either of you have had children, but you don't necessarily want someone touching you when you're rows of labor. So anyway, I essentially kicked her out of the room and I was in labor for 8 hours.And so she's off in some visiting room. She hasn't had any dinner. Anyway, so long laborious, labor, successful birth, everybody's gone. And I am now in my private room at the hospital. And I think it's probably two in the morning and all the lights are out and it's quiet.So I rang the nurse and I didn't have the baby with me because back then you had to request to have the baby in the room with you. Otherwise they would just keep them in the baby area so that the mother could sleep and they would bring the baby to you when it was time to feed. But they really wanted the mothers to sleep. And I understand that because once you're home, forget it. That's it.But I hadn't really gotten a chance to see her, so I rang the nurses and I said, could you please bring my baby? And they said, well, we haven't bathed her yet and she's asleep. And I said, I don't care. So they brought her in and they left the door open a jar. So there was just enough light coming in the room holding this perfect, beautiful baby.And it was just like this joy welled up. And she didn't wake up. She just laid it. But it was like this tableau, this glowing moment of just like perfection. It."

So that's kind of what I do. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened in your life? It can be something happy or sad, something from your childhood or more recent, just some important event that you could tell me a story about.And it's okay to take a few minutes to think of something you said happy or sad, any sort of emotion at all. Yeah.Well, currently the sad situation is that my daughter was scheduled to get married on March 27, and because of the COVID-19, this has had to be postponed. So that was a sad time. And it's still up in the air as far as if a wedding is ever going to take place.My daughter currently lives with me, and she's having a rough time with it, too.

She looked up into the tree, and there she saw her cat, Muffy, sitting way out on a branch.Muffy looked happy enough. Muffy didn't look concerned.

He'd had triple bypass surgery and had a hard time recovering from it, but he was coming along and getting better, and then he acted funny. He just didn't act right him, and I thought maybe he'd had a stroke. So we went to the emergency room and they did X rays and this, that, and the other thing, and they also thought he'd had a stroke, so they put him in the hospital and gave him medication.And one of the medications they gave him was Prednisone, which is a steroid. And he got better right now with and that worried the doctors, because with a stroke, you don't get better with prednisone like that. So they looked further and found a tumor in his brain, and he went down. He lived for almost a year, but he was constantly and perpetually losing ground, and he was in a coma for the last six weeks or so of his life. And I thought the pain I was feeling then was the worst pain I could have, knowing that he was dying.But when he died, the pain was ten times his back. And if it hadn't been for Hospice of the Bluegrass and their Bereavement program, I don't know that I would have made it. When you lose someone like that, you have to do your grief work. You can't go around it, over it, under it. You got to go through it.And if you don't do your grief work th you're ruined for the rest of your life.

It's interesting.I'm trying to think of certainly while teaching, sometimes having students, particular students who really are struggling and you feel like there's not clear communication. It's not a coherent reason for why it's not working and a resolution kind of thing. And you're struggling to understand. Certainly sending emails to find out, taking a moment, saying, I want to talk with you. I'm feeling these are my concerns.How can I better support you? Is there anything going on that you wish to share with me? Like those trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy and whatever they'd be interested in asking them. I think it really helps to just start with these are my concerns. I e.Missing rubric or behavior in class or something like that and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is, is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of where to go next with that. I'm trying to think I've had some really difficult situations with students of basically just really disagreeing over the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences. And I'm trying to think specifically, I mean, involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because then it's not just you and the other person if there's an agreement, if an agreement isn't achieved, it helps, from my perspective, to get other people involved and to find out from also other people who work with this particular individual. Is it just in this situation or is it a broader picture problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers? Those are things I can think of."

And you're supposed to be 18 to drink three, two beer and 21 to drink 6%. There was a little place out in the country called Pop Cassidy's where he served us beer when we were just years old. And we went out there and we were playing a pinball machine, and we were playing it for a couple hours, and we said, this is boring. Let's do something exciting.So they said, well, okay, let's go out to the old haunted observatory. Now, this is observatory to study the stars. And Cincinnati has a very famous observatory called Adler Observatory. And they've just built this as a works project, administration project, just someplace to get them to do it. So, I mean, immediately after the war, they said, we don't need two of these things, and this thing doesn't have this stuff.So they abandoned it. And the road was just a gravel road. It grew out with weeds and things like that. And it was out in the country, and I was out in the moonlight, and kids used to go out there and neck, and they used to smoke not cigarettes. They didn't smoke pot in those days.So we got there first, and we parked our car alongside the road. And then my buddy and I were walking down the road there, and he said, let's hide, and the girls are coming after us. And when the girls come, we'll jump out and we'll scare them. So I said, you get on that side of the road, and I'll get on this other side. So I hid in this big lilac bush.Well, instead of the two girls coming next, there's two more of our buddies coming down the road. And this boy named Dick Smith said he said, let's hide and jump out and scare the girl. And he got in the same liglac bush that I was in, and I tried to coordinate my breathing with him so he didn't know I was there, and he didn't have a clue that I was there.

We decided to go out when we got there later in the day when it was still snowing, and take a quick trip around the area to get our bearings. There were five of us on snowmobiles and this was my first time I had been on a snowmobile, even though I had told them I had ridden them before. We began to run through a series of roads in the backwoods areas of Vale and it got darker and darker and the snow became snowier and snowier.As we got through the area, the group began to spread out. I wasn't going as fast as everyone else and I lost track of the people in front of me, so I couldn't see which direction to go and drove off the side of the mountain in my snowmobile. I tumbled down the hill about 100ft, crashing through the darkness, falling off the snowmobile and eventually landing and stopping in the snow. I was momentarily, I think, unconscious, and when I woke up it was dark and cold and silent, which I thought was very bad because I didn't know where I was and I was in a snowstorm in a mountain and Vale somewhere lost. I began to move around to see if I was injured and I had hurt my back and my head, but could still move around, find my flashlight and start looking to see where I was.I had actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a 45 degree angle towards the top where the road was, and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was. So I began signaling with my flashlight and trying to yell for people when I heard a snowmobile coming. I saw the light and flashed my flashlight. He saw me, stopped and went to get help from the other group of people that we were with. About ten minutes later, they all came back.And after about a half hour, they managed to pull me up and the snowmobile and get us back up to the road to look over my damage and the damage to the snowmobile, which was pretty extensive. But we did managed to ride the crippled snowmobile back into town to the camp where we were where I proceeded to get medical attention and rest for several days."

And so the Prince started looking for her and he couldn't find her, but he found the glass slipper. So he said, I'll go find whoever this fits.And that'll be her. So naturally the stepsisters decided, oh, this glass slipper's got to fit one of us. Well, they tried it. Their feet wouldn't fit in it because Cinderella had a dainty little foot. And so finally Cinderella got to try on the glass zipper.So he knew that she was the one and ended happily ever after."

They actually were just in their front yard when they realized that their cat was following them. And so they stopped near the tree, and the dog came racing out and chased the cat up the tree. They tried everything they could think of to get the cat to come down. And meanwhile, the dog is continuing to bark and scaring the cat, so the cat isn't interested at all in coming down.So the dad ran to the garage and got the ladder, brought it out to the tree, and climbed up the ladder to get onto the branch near where the cat was sitting.But as he moved from the ladder onto the branch, the ladder fell away, so he wasn't able to get back down and, of course, was not able to reach the cat. The little girl was pretty cynthia was pretty upset. Still really scared for her kitty. Not that worried about her dad.So finally the dad realized this wasn't going to happen, so he yelled to Cynthia's mom in the house to call for help. The only people she could think of to help would be the firefighters. And so she called them, and they came racing towards the tree with a ladder to help the dad down.The dog was barking at the firefighters also, but they managed to ignore the dog and got the dad out of the tree, at which point, of course, the cat just gracefully walked to the the branch, joined the tree, and climbed right back down the tree.

And so the prince goes in search of the maiden whose foot fits this glass slipper. They come to Cinderella's house. The stepsisters try to say that it's theirs, and they try to cram their feet into the slipper. It doesn't actually fit.And in one version of the story, they start cutting off toes and heels, but in the children's story, they just try to cram the foot in there, and it doesn't fit. But lo and behold, it would be Cinderella's, but she wasn't there because the evil stepmother had locked her in her room, but her animal friends were able to get her the key. She comes out, and as the helper is going to help her try on the shoe or the slipper, the stepmother trips him, the slipper breaks. So now everyone's sort of distraught because how are they going to figure out where it is? And Cinderella says, well, I'll have the other one.She pulls it out, and it fits. They get married. They live happily ever after while the step family loses everything and is sort of just Spencer's and terrible people for the rest of their lives. Excellent. Very good.That was the best Cinderella story I've heard from the guy yet. Nice. Good job. Well, thank you. All right.And I'm going to tell you have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Okay, so to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you need bread, peanut butter and jelly. Depending on how hungry you are. You want to start out with two slices, maybe more. So you have put out a plate, put the bread on the plate, get your peanut butter, take the top off.Use either knife or a spoon, whatever suits your fancy. Get some peanut butter and spread it over one side of the bread. Set that down, close the peanut butter, open up the jelly. You may want to clean off the spoon, or you can just roll with it and scoop out some jelly. Put that on the other side.And then you put the two pieces together. Put everything away because you want to be nice and neat and tidy. And then, lo and behold, you have a wonderful sandwich that you can enjoy."

And so they would go throughout the kingdom trying to find a girl that fit. Eventually, the prince, or his prince, I believe, came to the home of the two stepsisters and mother and Cinderella, where he tried on the slipper to the two sisters, which were sure it would fit them, and of course, it did not. And they were very upset. And so the prince said, well, are there any other daughters in the family?And initially the mother said, no. And the sister said no. But Cinderella appeared and he said, well, may I try the slipper on motor? And he did, and it fit. And she became the princess.And they all lived happily ever."

But I had a full airplane and we were coming in to land. And the pilots decided to go around because they couldn't see the runway.

While we were coming in and they decided to go around and they didn't pull the gear up when they went around, so they stalled the airplane.And what that feels like is your whole airplane is like shaking and shuddering and going like this. And we could see the tops of the trees and somehow they put it in a nosedive to get speed up. And then they were able to barely able to pull it out. And everybody's looking at me and I'm a flight attempt, I have to smile. And my crew is normally they're allowed to make two attempts.And they said, that's it, we're done. We're going back to Denver. We're done for the day. And I guess the guys that work on the ramp are the ones waiting to flag us in. Saw the airplane come in and they saw what happened.And we almost crashed right over this really fancy area called Starwood where all the celebrities live. Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and Don Johnson, they all had their homes up in Starwood Dundenver at the time, but we almost cried. They said they saw us disappear, open a mountain and our hearts just went their throat. They were sure we were gone. They were just waiting for the flames to come up.But I was trying to pass out candy afterwards and beer, and I had this basket of candy and I was trying to act like, really normal, but the candy was popping out of the basket because my hands were like I was like it was really strange because it goes really in a slow motion.

Mother and daddy always told me my birthday was May the 13th, 1938. I sent to Frankfurt for my birth certificate. My birth certificate had a number of problems. It said my birthday was May the 15th, 19 and 83.It said to this woman had been born seven other children, all of which are dead now. The midwife had signed it June the 15th, and she signed it the right year. She signed it 1938. But June the 15th, she either signed it on the day I was born and nobody remembered, or she signed it a month later. So I had to get an attorney to get the year, and they wouldn't change the date.They said, you need to notify your Social Security and your insurance companies that you had used the wrong birth date. And the only way I had to find an attorney that knew me that would certify that I definitely had not been born in 1983, that it was very obvious that I had been born in 1938. And he referred to the birth certificate date, too. So that's my story. And I don't know that that will ever do anybody any good.But nobody believes me when I tell them. But it's true."

And by the time I got to Vermont, which is where we went, I could tell this was coming back. So I had to call the doctor far from far away, get more prednisone, get more antibiotics. And it went on like this one more time, and she sort of threatened me.The nurse practitioner was very funny. She said, now if this doesn't get any better and send you to a vein man, which scared the living whatever out of me, because I know that meant horrible little doppler things on my legs and I have very bad backers veins. So didn't want that. So lots of exercise, getting on my bike, riding the bike. I had to avoid walking for a while.That seemed to be not particularly good for it, but my exercise bike did a great job, and gardening, mowing the yard, that kind thing, it's just keeping that up. Gradually, the blood vessels return to health."

I like preserves, so that's what we're going to go with.I also like strawberry, but they come in different flavors. So you get your bread out of your bag, and if you have good manners, you put it on a plate. You then use a knife to put peanut butter on one piece of bread. And then if you have good manners, you get a different knife and you use it to put jelly onto the other side of the bread. And then you put it together and you eat it over your plate, your mouth."

And she also didn't have anything to wear, so she got all of her chores done and all the animals, the mice and all the animals helped make her a dress to wear to the ball.

And she went to the royal ball and danced with the prince. And he fell in love with her.And they were having their night of romance. And suddenly she remembered that her fairy godmother told her when the clock strikes twelve, the spell would be broken, that she put on her with all and she would lose her fancy dress and then her carriage would turn back into a pumpkin and her clothes would go back to her normal raggedy clothes. And so she ran off and left the prince. But when she ran off she had on silver slippers, glass slippers, and one of them, she stepped out of one and left them on the stairway going down from the castle. And so she went back home and the spell broke and everything turned back to normal and she went on about her business, but she still had one glass slipper and then one left behind.So again the palace sent out a notice to everybody in the community that the prince was going to try to find his love. And he was going to go around to all the houses that had young women in them and have them try on the glass slipper to See If to Find His Love and See Who It Was That Left That Slipper Behind. Well, the stepmother locked Cinderella in her room. And the ugly stepmothers tried to, when the people came, buy two for the girls in that house to try on the slippers.

And so her mom called my mom and we realized I hadn't had chickenpox, so we knew I was going to get them. So it didn't take very long, and I got the chickenpox, and I remember feeling really weak and lethargic and I would be just on the floor. We had a room that was like a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it, and I just slept on the floor. And I wasn't experiencing any pain or terrible itching yet, but that did come.And I remember feeling my mom would create this mixture of some kind of paste that she would put on the chickenpox. And I think that it was like, I want to say like baking soda and water. It was some combination of something like that, and it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store, and she probably was not going to do that because in order to save money, but it worked. I do remember that. And I remember she would put me in the bath with that oatmeal kind of mixture, and it was very soothing.And then after the bath would put this again, this paste or this mixture on the different spots. But even though those things helped me physically feel better, the thing that I remember about when I started to feel better, like, really feel better, is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff, stickers and we had sticker books, and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers, and I focused on my sticker book instead of the chickenpox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the kind of itching and scratching, and it put me in a better mood. So I wasn't as lethargic and I got better.

Okay.So I have a teenage daughter, and I know that they say that teenagers can be difficult to communicate with in general, but she also has a personality type that is very private.

Her stepmother said, no, you have to help me get the girls ready and dressed.And then you have work to do. You have to keep this house clean. You have to make sure that it is thick and span when the prince comes to claim his bride. Poor Cinderella. After the girls and their stepmother left for the ball, she sat and sat and cried.She wanted to go to this fancy party also. All of a sudden, a light started shining and a balloon came down and it got bigger and bigger and brighter. And she heard a giggle and she looked. And there in front of her was this sweet little bouncy bubbling lady. Why are you crying?Cinderella asked this sweet, bouncy bubbling lady. Because I want to go to the ball to this fancy party where the prince is going to be and dance with everybody. Well, we'll have to see about that. And by the way, just so you know, I am your very godmother, and I am going to help you, see? Get to the mall.Now, let's see. We got to get you a coach. We got to get you some clothes.

But what we do is, in case you don't remember everything about it, these pictures might remind you of how it goes.So I'm going to give you a chance to go through the book and look at the pictures. Then I'll put the book away, and you can tell me as much of the story as you remember in your own words.And they lived happily ever after. Okay? Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. When Cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house, and there was a stepmother, and the stepmother had two daughters.The father dies, and the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children, her two daughters, and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid. And they so to speak. So Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and all of that. And then the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes, and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella. And then comes the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for there to be a dance.And everybody is all looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the perfect outfit. And Cinderella is not going to go to the ball, and she is at home, and the sisters are all dressed and find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest.Wait a minute.I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing. So the sisters go to the ball, and poor Cinderella is home with her mice, and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance, I believe. So the fairy godmother creates the carriage to take her in, and the horsemen and everything is perfect. And her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball. So when she goes to the ball, she is the most gorgeous they are, and everyone just takes her breath away.She takes their breath away."

        "transcript": "Alright, so Cinderella starts when her father marries the evil stepmother and Cinderella is joined into this new family. And then the father mysteriously disappears for some reason, probably killed or murdered or maimed for his money, assuming that the evil stepmother is true to her evil her evil name. And then when she grows up, she is kind of like taken on as a maid for the evil stepmother and the evil stepsisters. And they all tell her to clean the floor and wash the dishes and make their food and stuff like that. And eventually one day the king of this kingdom that she lives in decides he's going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his son, the prince.The evil stepmother gets invited to the ball and she decides that it would be a great idea to have her two actual daughters go. And she schemes to have Cinderella stay behind. And Cinderella doesn't know this, so she is like mystified and she makes a dress and she gets prepared. And then when she shows up to go to the ball, the evil stepmother tears off her necklace and shreds up her clothing and says that she's not allowed to go because she's simple and she's not like one of the family. And so the evil stepmother goes with the evil stepsisters to the ball, and then Cinderella cries.And that's when her fairy godmother shows up and transforms some of her friends, her animal friends, into humans and transforms like a pumpkin into a giant chariot and gives her a magic dress and glass slippers and provides her with everything she needs for this party. And she heads out to the party in her pumpkin mobile, pulls up, hops out, stuns, everyone walks inside instantly. The prince is like, this is the future wife, and then walks over, they dance together and then the evil stepmother and stepsisters see that they're dancing and are shocked. I don't know if they recognize her, but they are shocked to see that they aren't the ones who are getting to dance with the prince. But Cinderella has to leave because her magic wears off at midnight, which is stupid, that doesn't make sense to me.If it's magic, it should just work. But she leaves, probably for a good plot point, and returns back home as herself, not in her gallant dress, but she left behind a glass slipper, which the prince finds. And the prince is mystified by her and decides that he has to go and find out who she is. So he roams the land fitting a shoe onto fair maidens, trying to figure out if they're the one who he danced with because apparently he just can't remember her face. I guess he just can only remember her shoe size.But eventually he arrives at Cinderella's house where the evil stepmother has locked her in a building. This part's from the movie, though I don't know if it was in the book. And then the animals help her get out of the room. And then she shows up downstairs when the prince is fitting the shoe onto the stepsister's feet and their feet are way too big and are squishing in. So he's disgusted.And then he sees her and kind of instantly knows it's her, but then has to put the shoe on because once again, I guess he can't just remember her face. And then shoe fits. They fall in love. And then evil stepmother."

And then as they grew up, the stepsisters made Cinderella do all the dirty chores.She had to clean the floors, had to clean the chimney, everything like that. So she was not happy, but she did her job. She wanted to keep her dad happy because he had already lost one wife. So one day in the castle, the king was talking to his right hand man and told him that he wanted his son to get married so he would have an heir to the throne. So the right hand man, which I can't remember the title for, I'm just calling the right hand man, went to all the houses in the village and gave them an invitation to a grand ball for all the people, all the girls eligible bacheloretes, to go to the ball, of course, being escorted by their parents.Well, Cinderella read the letter over her stepmother's shoulder and got excited because she thought, wow, I can go and I can be part of this thing. Well, her stepsisters didn't exactly like that. So Cinderella went and got it started to make a dress. She had the mice that were making dresses for her because hers wasn't very pretty and she wanted a pretty dress. So they made her a pretty dress.And the night of the ball came and she put on her pretty dress and went to where her stepmother and her stepsisters were waiting. And they were not happy. The stepsisters were not happy that Cinderella was even thinking about going. So they ripped her dress and ripped her necklace, took her, messed up her hair and said, you can't go. So after that, Cinderella went out into the garden and she was crying because she really wanted to go and she felt betrayed.So all of a sudden, up pops her fairy godmother.

So everybody was watching her dancing with him. But she remembered the one thing her fairy godmother told her she had to be home by the twelveTH stroke of mid."

        "transcript": "Okay. When Cinderella was a child, her father had remarried after her mother had passed away, and her new stepmother and two stepsisters moved in with them. As they got older, the stepsisters became meaner and meaner to Cinderella, making her do all the household chores and doing everything for them. Cinderella had no life of her own, so spent a lot of time with all the farm animals, telling them stories of how she would like to meet Prince Charming. Then one day, it was announced that Prince Charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife.So Cinderella got exciting, saying she would go to the ball and make a beautiful dress and meet Prince Charming. At the same time, the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball, also talking of how they would marry Prince Charming and live a wonderful life with him, too. So the night of the ball, cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made, put on some jewelry, and did her hair and was walking out when the stepsisters said, where do you think you're going? And Cinderella says, I'm going to the ball. And they ripped her dress to pieces and tore her jewelry off and messed up her hair so she couldn't go to the ball as they left and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her, cinderella was so upset that she couldn't go to the ball any longer, and she sat outside and cried.All of a sudden, the fairy godmother came along and said, what are you crying for? And she said, I can no longer go to the ball. My dress is all torn, and I have nothing else to wear. And the fairy godmother said, oh, dear, let me take care of that for you. And with the wave of her wand, she gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo, and she has some beautiful glass slippers.And Cinderella said, thank you, Fairy Godmother. But now how will I get there? And so the fairy godmother says, well, here's a coach for you to take you to the ball, but you have to leave at midnight or it'll turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella says, oh, no problem. I'll be home by midnight.Thank you so much. So off to the ball she goes, in her carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers. Cinderella gets to the ball and is in awe of how beautiful it is, and she sees Prince Charming. And Prince Charming sees her immediately and comes over to her and asks her to dance. And so they dance for hours, and then Cinderella hears the clock strike midnight, and she gets worried and says, oh, no, I have to leave.And she immediately runs out the door. And as she's running to the carriage, she loses one of her slippers and doesn't have time to go grab it. So she jumps in the carriage, and carriage takes her off into the distance, leaving Prince Charming to wonder who the beautiful woman was. So when Cinderella's home, all she can dream about is her night at the ball and how wonderful it was. And in the meantime, Prince Charming is wondering who this beautiful woman was and how he's going to find her, and realizes he can take the glass slipper and find out who it fits.And that will be his girl. So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on all the women to see if he can find her for him when he gets to Cinderella's house. His stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try the slipper on all the women. So they're convinced that one of them will fit into the slipper.When the man comes into the house and the shoe doesn't fit the two stepsisters, he sees Cinderella and says, you haven't tried the shoe on yet. And the stepmother."

        "transcript": "So we moved out to Michigan as a very young couple and shortly afterwards I found out I was pregnant with our first child. And oh my gosh, it was so exciting. I felt so healthy for nine months. I did have two fears was health fears but fortunately neither of those came true. Great pregnancy got up.I went to work every day. Due date was January 18 and first baby, the baby was not born. We did not find out the sex and even back then you could I wanted to be totally surprised. I love surprises. So on January 18 I had still not had the baby and had a scheduled checkup with the OB doctor and assumed it would be my last visit.Anyway, went in after work. My husband met me because first child he was at all the appointments and I am like, well before I moved to Florida, very fair and tall and fair tall and what was the other thing? Never like a muscular kind of person. So anyway, the whole time I'm carrying this baby, which by the way first baby, this baby barely moved and I had comparatively to the second, I had nothing. I thought it was fine because what did I know?Nothing. And every time I would push my stomach I would say, oh, she because my mother had three girls and my other sister had three girls and my other sister had a girl. So I would say, oh, she's going to have a really firm butt. This is wonderful. So last visit, last checkup, he does an internal and he's like, why don't we go across the hall?I want to do a scan or I don't know what they called it at the time. And he says yes. He goes, just what I thought. And I was like, Because I'm cloud. Like it was just such an exciting time because the baby is not in position so you're going to have a C section.And I was like a C section. That was one of my two secret fears of having a baby. I was like, absolutely not. You can flip this baby. You can do this.You can do that. He's like your first pregnancy. We really don't know why the baby didn't drop. I guess that was another thing on the image. He couldn't see the cord or he said a little bit, we don't really know how long the cord is.He gave me every reason this baby was not going to be flipped. So there's lots of things out there. Andrea. This was a Thursday. January 18.I should look to see if I'm correct in my memory and went home that night. There was no internet but like folklore, like upside down, leaning on an ironing board, flashlight between your legs, all this kooky kooky stuff. But anyway, monday. It was a Thursday. Monday I was scheduled for my C section.So on Friday I went for all my blood work. That was the only day I missed at work. I worked a full day on Thursday, missed Friday, and the baby was scheduled to be born on Monday. And Sunday night I went to bed and my water broke. And I was so excited because then I felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready.It's not like a C section, like, just ripping this baby out. So I was, like, all excited. And we were in Michigan by ourselves, so I didn't wake up my husband. I decided to go get my bag, and I got everything ready by the door before I woke him up. And I showered I shaved my legs.And now the contractions are getting worse. And I could not find the list of people he had to call."

Or you try to speak as clearly as you can, but they still don't understand even that much English, try to simplify it and they still don't understand it. Or they don't understand your accent, or if they repeat it back to you don't quite get it, what they're trying to say. When I was younger, my brother and I liked to go to my neighbor's house and he had a pack of Dobermans and we would tease the dogs because they were fenced in and we would go on our way. It was nothing, it was nothing.We didn't abuse the dogs, we would just mess with them and then we would go on our way home and inevitably the dogs would always get out and we'd literally have to run for our lives with a pack of Dobermans on our heels. And I was afraid of dogs pretty much my whole life until about 2000 because I had images of dogs chasing me for dear life, but they never did catch catch us and they never hurt us, but still I was afraid of dogs. This young girl has been caught in a floodwater or a raging river and someone saw this, called for help, help did arrive and he is in the process this fireman or rescue worker is in the process of trying to get her out of the water and take them both to safety. A young boy is playing soccer outside. He accidentally kicks a ball through a window and the ball knocks over a lamp.And there's a guy in that house who picks up the ball pretty surprised, and looks out, trying to figure out who kicked the ball or where it came from. There's a mom waiting by the door to say goodbye to her son and give him an umbrella. But the son decides he doesn't need the umbrella and leaves the house. He gets outside, he sees that it's raining. He walks on a little bit until it starts pouring.Then he goes back home. The mom is quite upset, he's drenched. He finally gets the umbrella, leaves and walks happily into the rain. Cinderella's dad introduces Cinderella to his new wife, who looks very unpleasant, and her two little daughters.And there's also a pet cat and a very sweet dog. Cinderella grows up to be a servant in the house. And her stepsisters grow up as well. Only they're not as beautiful as Cinderella is. Cinderella works around the house.She's working in the stables in the shadow of the castle.One day, Cinderella's stepmom gets an invitation to the castle. There's going to be a party. Cinderella makes a really beautiful dress and she gets ready and she's ready to go with them. But the stepmom encourages her daughters, who aren't very pretty, to destroy Cinderella's dress. And now she can't go to the ball either her.And then, incredibly, there's a fairy godmother who fixes Cinderella's dress, who gives her a carriage with horses and a really beautiful dress.

        "transcript": "It's all childhood stuff. That's okay. Yeah, go ahead. All right. Now we're going to middle school, where I was in homet class, and it was time to learn to sew.So I was sewing on a jacket with a little tiny one, eight seam, and as I was moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the a needle, and it does that, and I yanked it, so the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer, and he said he was going to pull it out, and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital, and they had to remove my fingernail and slice my finger open, take out the needle, and then X ray because they had little splinters of metal in there, x ray that and then sew it back up. And I had a huge Band Aid.And unfortunately, like, two days later, it was the middle school dance, and I was embarrassed because I had a new dress, and I had this great big old bandage. What helped me get over it, I think it was just time. Just time.I have more injuries. Thank you so much. Just one more for the road. That was great. Thank you so much for sharing.And, oh, my goodness. Today I do not sew. That was the end of my sewing days. And this homet teacher hasn't been retired long, and I was used. She said, here I am.Becca even had her when she was in middle school. She had to use me as an example through all of her years of teaching. So how's that?But I am curious. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? Okay, great.So in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did about it, if anything.I was special needs teacher for ten years and still go so does Bacca, for that matter. Still go to Eagleari once a year with them. And there are usually seven to eight that go, and we chaperone, and they have classes, but three of them are brothers, of which only one can speak. The others, you have to follow their hand communication. It's not that they sign language, but they try to because it's more in the grunting aspect of interesting enough, usually his mom knows what he's referring to, so I would say it's more being patient.And they eventually get their story out by pointing, by doing the same thing over. Or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you. And I think that is probably my nephew is autistic and nonverbal and pretty much it's the same thing. He just takes you by the hand and takes you to where he wants to go."

Once again she asks him, you really ought to take your umbrella with you today. No, Mom, I'm just fine.He walks out the door and starts walking to school, when all of a sudden it starts to rain. It starts raining harder and harder. He turns around, runs back and runs into the house. He's soaking wet, his hair's plastered down, his shirt is soaked, and his mom looks at him and says, now, didn't I ask you if you needed that umbrella? So he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school.Again, there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball, when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can. The ball sails quite a ways. In fact, it sails so far, it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room. When it comes through the glass after breaking the window, it even knocks over a lamp in the living room. The man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through, jumps up, grabs the ball and looks out the window.But the boys run away.There once was a young girl called Cinderella. She had three ugly stepsisters, and her family didn't like her very much and made her do all the household chores. She had to scrub and she had to clean, and she had to cook and sew and everything all by herself, while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun.One day, the prince was going to have a big ball, and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear, looking around, buying new dresses, checking out how they looked. But Cinderella couldn't go, when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says, what's wrong, Cinderella? Why are you so depressed? Cinderella says, I can't go to the ball that the prince is having, but my stepsisters get to go instead. And her fairy godmother says, well, nonsense.And she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears. And she says, well, you're going to need horses and a coach to ride. So she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage. And she gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball. But the stepmother said, the fairy godmother says, be sure you're home by midnight.The magic's only good for one day. At the stroke of midnight, all of this will disappear. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince. He just wants to dance with her all night when she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight.Oh, goodness. So she turns and races out of the ball. And in a hurry to get away, she drops one of her glass slippers, falls off of her foot, hops into her carriage, and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight, the horses change back into mice, the carriage changes back into a pumpkin, and her fancy dress gown turns into the rags that she wore in the kitchen. She sneaks into the house, and all her stepsisters were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady."

For instance, I grew up in a family. I was one of five children. And now, I don't want this to sound politically incorrect, but my father was Italian, of Italian descent, and he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college. And unfortunately four of us were girls, so he wasn't pleased with that either.And I was the third one. Can you imagine in a row. No boys yet. So anyhow, it was made very clear that college was not on the map. And his idea was that I've been supporting you all these years and now you owe me.You have to go to work and contribute to the household. So this was a built in thing. At the time, I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it that I'll be going to work soon. And the good news was that I was also an honor student and I got to high school at twelve.And the bad news was at 16 my education was complete and now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal. I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student, she actually wanted to call him. And I was very calm about the whole thing. I said, there's really no point, you're not going to get anywhere.This is the state of things. It's the state of the art at the Demiko household and that's that. So anyway, she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on Wall Street and who worked in a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust Company, which no longer exists. And they took great pride in that company. They were at One Wall Street and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street and this was verbalized.So anyway, she called her friend and I'll never forget her name was Mary Unru, who I went to say. So I put a suit on, went shopping and bought know, very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview. And I think I was a shoe in because her friend, the guidance counselor had called her. And so she hired me and I ended up in a sub basement. Not just a basement, it was a sub basement.I think I was lower than the vaults in a secretarial pool. Where else I could be a genius, but I was going to a secretarial pool. And good on me. I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to even though I had an academic course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study and I took typing and stenography. I thought this might help me.And maybe my job won't be so random. I have at least a specific skill rather than just a resident genius. Wherever I end up."

But her stepmother favored her children over Cinderella and had Cinderella do all the chores in their house. And the stepsisters didn't really have to do any chores.They were the favored ones. But Cinderella never complained. She made friends with all the animals around the house and was just a happy go lucky girl. And one day, there was going to be a big ball at the castle, and all the young maidens in the land were invited to attend the celebration.

So she was able to attend the ball. So she attended the ball.But her fairy godmother had one wish for her, or one statement for her, that all the dress and the carriage would expire at midnight, so she had to leave the dance before midnight.

And she saw the clock was getting close to being midnight, so she left in a hurry because she didn't want her gown to change back to just a plain old dress.

But she returned to her house and told her animal friends all about the dance and meeting the Prince.Well, unbeknownst to her, the Prince had kept the glass slipper, and he wanted to find out who the maiden was that wore that glass slipper. And so they took the glass slipper all through town to see whose foot would fit in the glass slippers. And when they came to her house, both her stepsisters tried on the slipper and it would not fit. So Cinderella came and said, may I try it on? And she did, and it fit.And her and her prince lived happily ever after.I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. First, you go to your cabinet and you take out the bread and the peanut butter. And you need two slices of bread for this sandwich, and you need a knife. And you spread the peanut butter it over one slice of the bread.And then you go in the refrigerator and get out your grape jelly and you put it on the other side of the bread and you close the two halves together and cut it diagonal."

And both mice pick up all the pearls and Lucifer was watching them, the cat, and they manage just to get the bead stuck on Jasper's tail and slide under the door, and they're safe.And the birds help, and the mice help, and they get the dress made up real pretty. They sing us on we can do it. We can do it. They get this song going and they get the dress made. And Cinderella comes in the attic and they surprise her with this beautiful dress.And she's so happy she can go to the ball. So she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and her stepsisters to wait because she could go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished all her chores. And the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks in her beautiful dress. And they see that the decorations are stuff that she quote unquote stole from their garbage. So they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back.And they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball. Cinderella goes running to the garden and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball. And this fairy godmother appears and does this bibity bobbity boo thing, whips up a real pretty white dress. And then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses, and she tells Cinderella to go dance with the prince, but she has to be back by midnight. The spell wore off.So Cinderella goes to the ball and she meets the prince, and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with. And she hears the clock strike midnight and she has to go. And the prince is like, but wait, but wait. I don't even know your name. And she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach, which will soon be a pumpkin.And as she's running down the stairs, one of her shoes falls off and she gets in the coach, and the coach takes her home and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin, and the horses turn back into the mice and dog footman turns back into a dog. And the next day, she's walking around in the house and she hears the Duke come to the door and says, the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride. But he doesn't know who she is, so he's going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that the Cinderella's left this maidens left behind. So he ends up going to Cinderella's house, and she hears the Duke coming to the door. She goes to her room and the stepmother locks her in her room, puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the duke into the house.The Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small. And as the mother's sitting there, the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rush get Cinderella. And again they run into the cat. But they escape the cat again. They go underneath the door and they hand the key to Cinderella and she unlocks the door.And as she's leaving, the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister. And one stepsister was too small. One's foot was too big. And as he's leaving, Cinderella runs down the stairs and says, but wait. I want to try this shoe on.And the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderella is the one the prince was dancing with."

        "transcript": "So Billy was at a soccer game, and when he got home, he was so excited because he scored a few goals, and he decided to keep practicing. And he kicked a soccer ball, and it went through the window and hit his dad on the knee. And his dad realized it was him and grounded him. Okay, great. Thank you.So we're just going to do again something very similar. I'd like for you to take a look at these pictures again. They tell a story. So take a look at the pictures and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, well, looks like John wanted to borrow his mom's umbrella, but his mom wouldn't let him.Or his mom tried to give him an umbrella, but he didn't accept the umbrella. And then he walked to school, and it was raining, and he got really wet, and he was upset and realized he should have listened to his mom. So the next day, he brought an umbrella to school. Okay, great. All right, and now I'd like for you to take a look at this picture again.It tells a story, so take a look and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, so a family's cat got stuck up in a tree, and the dad wanted to go up and try to get the cat, but he couldn't, so they ended up having to call the fire department to try to get the dad and the cat out of the tree. Okay, great. All right. So now, are you familiar with the story of Cinderella?Yes. Okay, so I'm going to get you to take a look at this book. This will just kind of help refresh your memory. So take a look at the pictures in this book, and when you're finished, I'm going to take the book back, and then I'm going to have you tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay?Okay, I think I got it. All right, so Cinderella was, I think, adopted and brought into a family. She had two stepsisters and a mom. She was really mistreated. She was basically treated like the house slave or whatever.She'd do everything for him. So she developed relationships like the animals and stuff around their property or whatever. And then eventually she meets this fairy godmother that grants her wish to go to this ball or something of that sort. And she meets a prince and has, like, a great night with him and everything and loses one of her slippers. And then at the end of the story, the prince comes back with the slippers, and the two evil stepsisters are trying to pretend, like, think, oh, my slipper might fit me.But then it ends up fitting Cinderella, and basically your dreams come true. Okay, great. All right, so we have one more thing. It's going to be a little bit different. So I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.I would get out the bread first."

        "transcript": "And my husband said, surely you haven't put something into my back. It's not right. And so the doctor came in at that time, and I said, he's afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity. So he goes out and gets the head nurse, and she comes up, does another she goes and cleanse it out again, which she said, I don't like doing this twice so soon, but I feel like I should. Well, the 11th day, I was at work, and they called me and they told me that he told me that he was shaking the bed, he was jerking.So well, he said, Get him to the hospital. I called the doctor, and he said, Get him to the hospital. And the bacteria we ran into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office, and she smelled at the area. She said it's back. So there they had killed all of those blood cells in there.No hope. So he had to wear a tube. They said it'd be in there for years, and it'd be there the rest of his life. And so this goes on for eight years. I had to change the bandage and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet.And it was very painful at first. I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time, to get the catheter. And all changed because it was a procedure that had to be done in the hospital. Well, my daughter was a nurse, and she kept wanting me to go to the VA because he was a veteran and get the things over there. And they had a Bacteria committee over there that might be able to help him.So we go over there, and while we were in this office, there was this cabinet there that had tape, silk tape in it, and it was wide. And so I asked the nurse, I said, Where do you get that wide tape? I said, I can only find the narrow, and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged. We were paying over 200 or close to $300 at that time, a month for his supplies. And she said, you can have anything you want.Well, the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was procedure, that he knew I could do it, but he wouldn't give it to me because it was a procedure done in hospital. So when she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her what size of catheter I wanted, sterilized pins and the solution to irrigate with and everything that he needed and sterilized gloves and all. So I go home, and the first time it needed to be irrigated, I do it myself. Well, after I got through, I sat there, couldn't get up, because I thought if that pin that went down into his cavity, they'd have to do surgery to go in there to get that tube out.I was scared to death. But he said I did much better job than they did in the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through them to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity.And that way I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He weighed 200 and some pounds, and then he went down to 126. When he went left the hospital and he came back up, nobody knew that he was sick. And the doctor said that he couldn't have lived if it hadn't been for me.He wanted to have the the doctor said the only thing that they could do is go in there, clean that cavity out and put in marbles in there to make that build it up to where he'd have more stability. And I says no."

        "transcript": "Oh, I remember. This was in Marvel Plata in Argentina. We're living there for a while, and I was staying at a friend's house in Miramaram, which is about 45 minutes away, and driving back to Marl Plata to do the business and then going back to the other seaside. So at least a week, but it may have been more, but at least I did it until they saw this guy coming every day. What's he doing?Oh, he's selling the ticket. No wonder we don't get such a long line. He's taking the business. Okay, I have one more that's very similar. Again, if you'll look through these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.So this goes back to a time when my brother Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's house. Now a little bit about our neighbor. He was a bachelor gentleman. He was very nice, but he did not want us playing ball in our backyard, which was very close to his house. So what was supposed to happen, and I told know, one day one of us is going to kick the ball into our neighbor's window.His name was Mortimer. So we're going to kick the ball into Mortimer's window. We're going to be in trouble. He said, no, we shouldn't worry about that. Okay.It went with it until the day came when Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's Mortimer's window. So it went on into the house. Not only did it break the window, it also knocked over a lamp that Mr. Mortimer had told us was a very dear object in his house. It had a history of family inheritance and heirloom that I can't quite remember.But I do remember how much he appreciated the lamp. So we were both frozen when we saw Mortimer look through the hole that Sam had just put in the window. And I can't tell you what the consequences were, but I do remember that we had a very hard time after that incident.Thank you very much. Excellent. I could have gone on for 50 consequences. And then the suit went a higher court, and then we hired a different lawyer. Good restraint, because I have so many other tasks for you.Okay, here's a similar task. Please look through these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. I remember my aunt Charlote. My Aunt Charlote was a very wicked person.I did not like her at all. And I remember staying in her house one day. For some reason, we weren't allowed to stay at home because the painters had just finished painting and they didn't want us to sleep where there was paint, fresh paint, smell around. So I stayed at Aunt Charlote. Well, lo and behold, the next day it turned out that it was a rainy day, so I'm going to go to school, which was a much longer walk from Aunt Charlote's house than it was from my house.And it was raining. So I said, hey, Aunt Charlote, can I please borrow your umbrella? And guess what she said no. Which I knew she was going to say, no because that's how wicked she was. So I went out in the rain and eventually realized that I was going to get the flu.We did not have coronavirus in those."

        "transcript": "Great. After that horrible rotator cuff thing. Let's see. Oh, gosh, I'm going to just go with that and try I don't know, I hate to pain you with such a okay, here we go.Okay, so ten years ago in July, I had a right rotator cuff repair, surgery three. And it was going to be a little bit more involved that there was a growth somewhere up there, so he couldn't do it endoscopically, so I knew it was going to be open. Shoulder surgery went in, and the slight tear in the rotator cuff at that point, from the time of the MRI to the surgery, went from a slight tear to a full tear. He also saw for the first time that my bicep was fully torn and that the nickel size growth apparently now is the size of golf ball. So he graft bone from, I don't know, collarbone area.And the bottom line is he was from this area, he was all the way down bicep area, and that was that. It was supposed to be a day surgery. Later that evening, the nurse came in, monitored me, monitored me, and I had horrible pain all night. And then eventually around, I don't know, three or four in the morning, I really don't know what time she came in, and she jabbed my thigh with a thing of morphine and knocked me out. Finally, she had done that at midnight.And I forgot a really important point. Earlier in the evening, the evening nurse came in and rubbed my arm. Here, can you feel this? Can you feel this? Yes.And then when she got to like mid forearm, can you feel this all the way down in my hand? I said no. And she says, oh, no worries. Sometimes the block takes up to 24 hours to wear off. But I was kind of like kind of sort of freaked out about it, but anyway but I didn't know any better.So into the bad night morphine around three, four in the morning. And then the surgeon came in for his rounds early in the morning, like around six ish. I heard you had a horrible night. I said, yes, and I was supposed to be day surgery. Well, you're going to have to go home soon.It's only going to get worse, he said, so I'd be happy to give you another block. But I have to tell you, there's a 50 50 chance if they give you another block, you could lose feeling in your fingers forever. And I remember just being like, I've never heard this before anyway, so I didn't want it, but I was already starting to be in a lot of pain, and I only had had the morphine had only been, I don't know, no more than 4 hours old. So I was panicked. I said, Let me think about it.He said, you think about it, but I'm going to go around, do the rest of the floor come back to you. You have to have your answer by the time I come back. So I said, all right. As soon as he left, I was like, I can't chance it. And I was afraid to fall asleep.Bruce was coming. He was dropping the kids off in high school at that .1 of them was. So he was there by 745 in the morning, told him the same story I just told you, and I said, I don't want to risk having the second block. So I didn't. And there was a wonderful male nurse on that day for the morning shift, and he medicated me as much as he could with the orders, the standing orders, to make it to day surgery and get me through.Ended up being released around four. That was there was a lot of EEG and all sorts of tests and second and third opinions. Boston and York, they all said, Surgeon error. Meantime, I had done PT. I started OT I, which was a little bit dicey, because when a surgeon gives you PT orders, they typically refer you to the PT place they own, so therefore, those people are somewhat."

        "transcript": "So I ended up in a secretarial pool. And banks are notoriously very frugal. And back then things were even worse. And the Irving, as they called themselves, were a very conservative organization and I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved. So if somebody in the upper floor is above sea level, needed some help for a day or however long, they would call down to the trenches where I was.So I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in. It was sort of like I could imagine Little Orphan Annie at the or being at any orphanage where a call comes in and they pick you.A call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the 12th floor, he was a senior vice president of the bank secretary was unexpectedly out and they needed a fill in. So they selected me. Off I went and I walked in and you could hear a pin drop in this place. I could tell it was going to be I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of light heartedness. It was almost as though they should have had a font of holy water and you should genuflect before you to sit down at your desk.So there I am and it turned out that his secretary I'll fast forward a little. So here I was. My skills are good. I'm answering the phone. I'm taking shorthand letters.Things are getting things are humming along. Everything is great. And it turns out that the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back. She was pregnant and was having some difficulties, some complications. So the absence was going to be long term.And they hired me and I had a raise right away. I thought, this work. Life is a cinch. I'm here for a week and I got a raise.I got out of the sub basement. I'm in the light of day. Things were moving along so quickly that I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall Street. There's a trajectory I was on. So one day I was there for about three months, I guess, and I was out to lunch still trying know, explore the area.It's a very exciting know wall street. And I found the New York Stock Exchange and I was sort of like a pseudo tourist. So I was walking up Broadway one day and I encounter the Marine Midland Bank, a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube, huge. Went up a few stories and I thought, this looks like a much more light hearted place to work than the Irving. It was a great place.Light and airy, modern. I went in and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was. So I was directed there. I sat down, filled out an application, and I was drunk with power by then because I had gotten a raise. Things were moving so quickly.So I filled out the application. The interview with the personnel manager went very well. She told me about three different types of positions I could have and visited all three of them, and I could pick whichever one I wanted. So I picked the one in the international department. That sounded really interesting to me."

So when mom leaves, Carl immediately goes to the window and looks out to see and also to make sure she's gone. Then Carl goes over to the crib and stands upright so the little boy can climb over the crib and right onto Carl's back.Now we're having some fun. The little boy rides to Carl and they go into mom and Daddy's bedroom and they both well, really it's Carl who jumps up on the bed. The baby goes with him.

Then we see the baby on Mommy's and the baby has a powder puff and baby is powdering Carl's nose.In the next picture, we see the baby with a fancy hat. It's ankerton with a powder pump on top. But Carl is wearing beads around his head between his eyes. And he also actually he has one ear sticking out and he has the powder box lid on his head. They're very proud of themselves.They both look gorgeous. The next picture shows a little boy. He has found his way to the laundry chute.

He's not sure what's going to happen. Little boy disappears. Carl races down two flights of stairs.

Now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank. I don't have to tell you what happens. Next thing we see, the little boy is in the fish tank and Carl, with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt, the back of his shirt and pulls him out.Well, safe again. Now we have him all dried off. And Carl goes into the room with the stereo and he starts playing, turns it on, chooses some music, and he starts dancing. So Carl is dancing in the middle of the rug in his hind legs. And the little boy is just thrilled.He ceases and he just giggles and laughs and he can't quite dance yet, but he really loves to watch the dog dance. Uh oh. We've gone to the kitchen.

The track coach was ed because I couldn't run track the next year, and I had just broken a city record in the quarter mile. So he wasn't happy. So did that right after the injury.I'm thinking it was in March, maybe April. I had my first surgery, and then I've had two other arthroscope surgeries since then, and then all topped off by in May of 84 or May of 84? No, May of 2017. I had a total knee replacement. And it did okay.It got me better, but it didn't get me back to normal. So I'm still fighting with knee pain and not having fun. And that's my story. I know last week you did share that you've had experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. Just describe to me what the problems were and what you did about it.Again, this can be the same example you chose last week, or it can be a different one. I have to think of this a little bit. I would say I'm going to change stories on you this week. I've got a good friend. His name is Jorge.He's Mexican, and he and I worked together at a company called Netsolve. And what we did was it was remote diagnostics of router trouble, network trouble, and Jorge was great that he could talk to Spanish speaking customers, wonderfully, but when it would come over to an English speaking customer, he definitely had a problem. He didn't have terrible problems, but it was hard trying to get him to recognize that he wasn't saying things right, and it was hard getting him to understand what I was saying sometimes. So we got to the point where I joked with him about some of the ways he would say things like he would have a piece of paper instead of a piece of paper, and then it was just, Jorge, you sound like this. And he was totally shocked because he didn't know he sounded like that.And he says, JB, you are the first person that's ever told me that I'm saying that stuff wrong. So that felt good that I was able to help him and I was able to learn about his communications because he helped me. I had high school Spanish that's been a few years ago, but he helped me understand some phrases, and in fact, he actually helped my daughter with her. She went on a what do you call it? It's not an immersion in Mexico.And when she came back, we had Jorge and his wife over for dinner, and they talked Spanish the whole time, so I couldn't understand what they were saying. But Bonnie, my daughter, could definitely do."

They were her only friends.She was so busy, she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends.Cinderella's gentle heart would carry her a long let's back up a little bit. I am thinking about the pictures in the book.On the other side of the town was a castle, and the town was ruled by a king. This king had a son, and the son was of age. To be married, they needed a new heir to the throne, and if he wasn't married, he could not become king. So the king decided to throw a ball, inviting all eligible young women, so he would have a large number to pick from for his future bride.The invitations were delivered, and certainly the stepsisters were invited. In fact, every young eligible woman was invited. Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation, but the stepmother was not about to let her go. So she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives, once in a lifetime opportunity. But she was unable to go.So off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball. And Cinderella stayed at home, very sad, very lonely, when suddenly some magical event appeared occurred. And her very godmother appeared and said, do not cry. You can go to the ball. And Cinderella was very concerned about her dress, and the stepmother instantly created a dress for her and turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice into horses.And Cinderella was ready to go to the ball. But one warning she was giving was, if you don't return before midnight, everything, all the magic, wears off, your dress will become racks again, and your carriage will become a pumpkin again. She said, don't worry, stepmother very godmother, I will. So she goes to the ball, has a wonderful time dancing with the prince, and he's entirely taken with her. No one knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way.The stepsisters didn't even recognize her.Well, it's getting close to midnight."

She becomes this actually their maid and housekeeper and has to attend to their needs and the needs of the household. And evidently, Father was of no help in mediating any of this. So the girl ends up being in the household, but being rather a member of the household, being a servant. As I said, one day a ball is announced.She lives in, I guess, a principality headed by royalty and one day a ball is announced. If I recall correctly, it's because the prince is in need of finding a wife. His father tells him that it's time for him to marry. So a ball is organized, and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend. And the three stepsisters and their mother plan to go.And they get their gowns ready. And Cinderella has to help them with that, too. But it turns out that she's not going to be allowed to go. She, of course is very sad about that. Enter her fairy godmother.They go off to the ball. The stepsisters and stepmother go up to the ball. Fairy godmother Arrives On The Scene and Says To Cinderella, you're going to go too, and we're going To Get You There by Turning This Pumpkin Into A coach and These mice Into Coachmen. And I guess the mice, too, become horses. I'm not sure which animals become the horses, maybe the mice.She's outfitted Cinderella's outfitted with a gown and a pair of glass slippers. Why glass, I don't know but she's told she has to get home by midnight because at the stroke of twelve everything's going to turn back to what it was. The coach will become the pumpkin, the coachman will become the mice. She'll lose her beautiful clothing, so she goes to the ball, promises to leave by twelve, but she's having a great time and the prince is very much drawn to her and she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve, but gets out in time and gets back home in time. But as she's running out one of her slippers comes off and the prince picks it up and it turns out that she's the one that he wants and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the glass slipper.So a hunt is organized, so to speak, where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper. And the stepsisters, of course try and they don't it and they try to push their feet into that slipper and doesn't work and they're very upset. And lo and behold, cinderella's foot fits perfectly was her slipper. And they're very, very surprised, shocked and upset."

They were very horrible people, just in general, but they got married, and so they blended the families. But meanwhile, Cinderella's father passed away. And the minute that he passed away, the evil stepmother started treating Cinderella very poorly. She would basically give her daughters anything and everything that they wanted.So she spoiled them rotten, but made Cinderella basically be the servant for everyone. She would have to scrub the floors, do the cooking, take care of the sisters. But one of the dreams that Cinderella had was to meet or to go and see the castle. Well, at the same time, in the castle, the king has really sort of frustrated because his son, the prince prince Charming prince Charming has not selected a bride. So he's trying to think of a way to get his son to sort of urge him along to get married.So he decides to throw a huge ball and invite all of the maidens from the entire kingdom. So, of course, the invitations go out to everyone. Cinderella's stepmother receives one, and it's asking for all of the young women to come to the ball. Of course, the evil stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited, and so they want to start getting prepared. But the stepmother does not want Cinderella to go, so she says she can go, but only after she finishes all her chores.But she overloads her with all of her chores, but she also has to help her stepsisters get ready, so basically, she has no time. However, Cinderella is friendly with all of the animals, the rats, the horses, and just everything. She can actually sort of talk to the animals. And while she is doing all of her chores, they're actually helping create her a dress. It was one that she had, I guess that was her mother's.So they fix it up and make you look obviously modern for the time and fix it up. And as she finishes all of her chores, she gets in and very sad because she thinks that she's not going to have time to get ready. But, alas, she is able to try to get ready to go, and she puts on the dress and steps out to catch the carriage to go with her stepsisters. But the rats and the animals had actually used bits and pieces of her stepsister's cast offs to make the dress. And when they saw that, they, of course, became jealous because they were spoiled rotten and not very nice.And so they started tearing her dress, the various pieces off, and so they left her dressed in tatters and left her in emotional tatters. And so she runs back to a room and is crying. But at that moment in time, she meets her fairy godmother, who is, well, a fairy, and so she is able to bippity boppity boo and cast spells, to make a dress, to make a carriage, to have just sort of a very royal type entrance. So she goes to the ball, meets Prince Charming. They have a wonderful time, but the spell would only last until midnight.So as they're dancing the night away, she loses track of time and it's about 1158. So she starts to flee the ball and she has to get away before midnight or everything goes back to the way that was. And as she's running away, she loses one of her glass slippers, which is one of the actually the glass slippers and mistranslation. It was actually supposed to be a five and leather sandal, but that's something totally separate. Loses one of her glass slippers, runs away, one of the Prince's helpers, actually, the King's helper, who is sort of like one of the Prince's friends, finds the glass slipper."

She's very vain.She's always asking her mirror. She's like, magic mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? And the mirror is like, well, actually, it's Snow White. And she's like, what? And the mirror's like, yeah, she's the fairest.Can't lie to you. And so the witch hires a hunter to go and kill Snow White. Well, the hunter goes out, and he's getting ready to do it. And then he sees her and he's just like, I can't do it. So he drops his knife and he tells her.He's like, you need to run. He said, the witch is trying to kill you. You got to go. And so she runs off into the woods. And the woods are, like, attacking her.They're reaching out and grabbing at her and everything. And so she gets really lost. And then she finds this little cabin out in the woods, out in the middle of nowhere. And so she goes inside. Everything in there is like miniature.And so she's just like, what's going on here? But she's really exhausted from running, so she crawls into one of the beds and crawls up and goes to sleep. Well, the house actually belonged to seven dwarfs, and they had been out working all day. And so they come back home. You can imagine they're surprised when they find a woman sleeping in their bed.They're like, what's going on here? And so they all gather around and they're staring. They're like, what is this? And she wakes up and she's like, startled. I mean, what do you expect when you got seven little creepy men staring at you?And so they calm her down after the first shock of seeing all of them. And they decide to throw a big party because there's someone new at the house. And so they all get out their instruments and they're playing, having a good old time. And she feels right at home there. She starts cooking for them while they go out and work.And she cleans out the place because it was a pig sty. And she falls in love with them as a family.

An old lady has a basket full of apples.And so the old lady offers her an apple. And she's like, yeah, sure. I'll take an apple. And she takes a bite. Well, the old lady was really the witch in disguise, and the apple was poisoned.And so Snow White falls asleep, and the dwarves can't wake her up. And they start chasing the old lady and she's climbing up the mountain and she's holding onto a branch and she's climbing up, and lightning strikes and it breaks the branch and she falls off the side of the mountain and dies. And then the Dwarves are just so sad because they can't wake Snow White up. Then they capture this guy that's, like, riding through the woods and they bring him back and they're like, Something's wrong with her. And he sees Snow White and he's just."

She was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them. The little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree.And little Sally was worried about the cat, so she went and found a ladder. She was going to put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and, oh, no, don't worry about it. I'll get the cat out of the tree. At which point the dog came back and scared the man and he ran up into the tree. Little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree.So she had to call the firemen so that they could come and rescue everybody.I will tell you about having my tonsils out at Christmas. I had had strep throat five times in one year, and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to have to come out, which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult and I still had them at all. So my sister came into town to stay with me during that week while I was going to be getting them out. And I had to go to Scottsdale. I think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done.But they did it, like on a day surgery. But what I remember about it most is it hurt. But my surgery was scheduled at like 1130 in the morning, but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there, I was like, a little bit dehydrated. So they couldn't find a vein.And they had to stick me, like six times in order to get the IV in. And that was very unpleasant.They finally got it in, took me into the little hospital room, and I remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, oh, that's going to be great. You're going to give me drugs, and I'm listening to Pink Floyd, so this is going to be a good day. So did that.Laid down on the gurney. They gave me the IV, and then the next thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery and my throat hurt. It was painful. I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurt so bad.They were trying to give me some water to help kind of soothe out my throat. And I couldn't swallow it, so it was coming back out of my nose. It was a mess. It was horrible. But the whole thing probably took, like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out.But it was like 12 hours of torture for that. And that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. People are like, oh, you always get ice cream.You get ice cream. But I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't have ice cream. So that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt and it was burning my throat. And it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that.And I've had people ask me, if you had to do it all over again, I'd just continue to have strep throat. That's what I would continue to."

So I remember my efforts to mentioning to my wife and father in law, let's talk about music, or let's play music. She was a piano teacher, but didn't make much of a difference.Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you? And it could be something happy or sad or anything in between from childhood to now, just something that stands out that you could tell me a short story about. Okay, so I've had a very fortunately, a very diverse life and very traveling and living in different so, let me see. So my trip on a kayak, a solo trip on a kayak in Argentina where I capsized and spent the night in a wet tent that the wind blew down and I was sort of in a bed that was all wet but too weak to do anything about it. And that may be one my entrepreneurial efforts in a train station where I was buying tickets from people who were standing in line and saving them the waiting period and then buying the tickets for the price that they would have got once they got to the window, which was a heavily discounted price.Could be as much as 60% off if the tickets were during the next 24 hours and then selling them for the official price at the line where they were lining up to buy the ticket. I don't know. What would you like me to elaborate on? I'm trying to think. Either one of those is a great choice.Yeah, just one of those. And just tell me a brief story about it. All right? Okay. All right.So I once went to a train station to buy a ticket for my mother who was wanting to go back from town a to the capital of the country in Argentina. And my mother wanted to travel the next day, so I went to buy a ticket for the next day. And there was a long line of people waiting to buy tickets for the next day. But then at the other end of the hall, there was a line for people returning tickets. So I found that if you were returning a ticket for the next 24 hours, you got 60% knocked off the price, you only got 40% of your money back.So I found somebody who was going to return a ticket for the next day, and I said, look, they're going to discount 60%. And they said what? No, that's impossible. I said, well, you can check with information office. And so this person checked and yes.So I said."

So my oldest daughter's a nurse, and she said, Mother, you must get a second opinion. She said, don't ever let nobody cut on you without a second opinion. And a lady at our church, she had used Dr. Kennedy here at the university.And so I called and set up an appointment, and they did some x rays and confirmed that I did have a lump in my left breast. And I actually was here to get a second opinion, but I liked him so much better than I did the guy at the Lexing clinic. I said, I ain't going back to that other guy. They did a biopsy and they did a lumpectomy, and I went home with a drain from the incision, and I think that really helped because it got all that poison out of there and my lymph nodes were fine, it had not spread. And that was a really happy day when the nurse called me and told me that because sometimes the prognosis is not as good.That was about 14 years ago. And the amazing thing about it, though, about twelve years later, I had another lumpectomy in the same breast, two inches apart, different kind of cancer. And the nurse told me that she had known women that had had three lumpectomies in the same breast. And I said, Well, I don't want to be that one, I don't want to be that one. But I've done well since then.It's been just about three years ago, the last time."

A room would get a room and then you would get a parcel of a kitchen when you think about it.

So you would jump in in the morning and you would just spend your whole day there and you would be spent by the end of the day. And I still remember the smells and the sights of it and I remember the routines, being Catholic on a Saturday, there was a place called Rutz Hut, which I think is still around, but it was this little over the boardwalk, over the beach kind of place.And on Friday nights, my mother and my aunt and they'd wake us all up to go to on Friday, we're really first thing Saturday morning at midnight.

Anyway, so I'm thinking a lot about college, and the thing that's been important to me about college and the reason I volunteer so much of my time for it is that I went to a rural, suburban high school in Ohio that was focused primarily on sports. And so those of us who were nerdy types my dad's a nuclear physicist, my mom is an English teacher out of there wasn't much for me to do in my high school, and academics were not stressed at all.No AP classes, no advanced anything. And so when I got to college, it was a revelation that here are all of these people my age who were similarly interested in reading and in books and in travel and things that most of my friends from high school were not particularly interested in. And I think I remain to this day, the only woman from my high school to ever get a doctorate. So I am very thankful to my college for providing that new community for me. And so that's one of the reasons I continue to contribute as a volunteer.Anyway, that's a happy thought because I just zoomed with my three best friends last night because one of them just retired, and we met our first day of college. And we've been dear friends for almost 40 years now. So it's a very special place."

Not a river, it was a creek.Well, anyhow boys will be boys. And we defied all ODS and we went down and we always had like hammers and nails that we bore from our father's workshops. So we went down and we found some logs and some OD boards and we put together a raft and we went rafting and the water was very free flowing and it was fantastic. But of course, we hit one point and there was an ice flow and the raft went sideways and we all went into the water. And at that time we wore rubber boots, but they were no help because the water was more like waist deep and we got soaked from the waist down, water went in the boots and then we finally made it to shore, thank goodness, otherwise it could have been more serious.And when we got to shore, we emptied our rubber boots, but we still had our socks on and we were wet and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in the spring and we had to walk the whole mile home on a gravel road and it was like slosh, slosh, slush, slosh. And it was getting colder because when you're wet like that we got home and unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in the door. Where have you been? What happens? We got a huge reprimand, but thankfully we made it home.But because the temperature was dropping, our sort of jeans, or at that time, whatever we were wearing, I remember they were starting to become more like cardboard, you know that we're starting to freeze."

Fortunately, it did not damage anything other than that. Had the doctor said had it been a little bit closer to my ankle, I would have lost a whole foot. But after we immediately dad took me to the children's hospital in Columbus, Ohio, and the next day they operated on my leg. They were able to splice the tendon, sew it together, and then a few days later, they were able to take skin from my right leg, because this was my left leg from my right leg and closed the wound by putting the skin on.And surprising thing about it was 30 pieces of the skin. They were little round things at that time. They used a suction machine to take the skin from one place and deposit it on the open wound in the other place.

The closing was something else because I had tried to prep them through their daughter of what was going to take place and she was a sweetheart, she tried so hard but some things she couldn't understand either.

Onto the branch until such time as a helicopter, which was hovering overhead, was able to lower one of the paramedic technicians by rope down to be able to rescue her and to retrieve her back to safety.Her life was saved, even though she put the paramedics into great danger. The car was lost, and she paid her $10,000 fine for dispatching the helicopter."

So she runs from the ball as he chases her and she throws a shoe because the girl couldn't keep her shoes on as she's running home. It's almost midnight. It does strip midnight.And all of a sudden, all of the magic is gone and everything's returned to normal. She still had a wonderful evening and remembers it as that saves the one shoe and picks it up and puts it in her trunk. So when the prince and his people start going around the kingdom to find the girl who fit the shoe, they go to every household. In a deeper, darker story of Grimm's, the two sisters do terrible things. One cuts off her toes one cuts off her heels so they fit in the shoe but no.The birds avenge them. So Cinderella finally gets to try in the shoe. It fits. She gets to marry the prince, but she also forgives her evil stepmother and her sisters. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.I would go to the bread cabinet and open it up and pull out a loaf of bread.

We would go into the cabinet and get the peanut butter, and then the jelly is in the refrigerator.Both jars would need to be opened. Now, first I would take the peanut butter and smear it onto one half of the bread. Then I would take the peanut butter knife knife and clean it off on the other side of the bread just to make sure that it's not going to cross contaminate the peanuts into the jam, which is really going to do anyway, but not that bad. Then we get the jam and smear it on that side of the bread. Once it's complete, both pieces are lined up together.One paper towel is wrapped across the bottom so that the crumbs don't come out and you can eat it with your hands and not have to worry about a plate. And wipe your hands on the paper towel afterwards."

Which was really fun. But one of the issues I've always had with swim team is that I would love going to the practice and talking with the people on the teams, but whenever we would compete was when I would get super nervous. I would be very on edge. And there were times where someone had asked me, I need you to do this race for me, or I can't do this race, and they'd ask me to step in.And the idea of Go going into a situation and saying, okay, I only have to do these few races, was something that kept me calm during those. So when someone would come up and say, like, hey, I need you to do this race, or I need you to do this, it would throw off my balance and it'd be like, I can't even swim anymore, or something like that. But there were some times where it worked out and sometimes it didn't. But overall, I was still there and I still wanted to help the team. So when this regional race came up, it was the first time I had gone to it because I missed it my freshman year because I had to go to some family thing.So it was the first time I was there. And what had happened last year was we got last place out of everyone, so I was kind of glad I wasn't there. But this year, our instructor or coach was telling us that he had high hopes for us because we had won a majority of our our other competitions or other meets. So he put everyone on their usual races, and then for me and some other kids, he gave us some extra races, which was something I'd never dealt with before. I'd usually been put down to do like two races or maybe occasionally three, but I think I had four for this event and that was like, crazy to."

So tell me all of the steps how to make a peanut butter and jelly.Okay, well, since you don't know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I will tell you. So first you get two pieces of bread doesn't matter what kind of bread, city bread. And then you get peanut butter and you get jelly and I guess there's lots of ways to do it but the simplest way is just get a knife, get some peanut butter on there and then spread it over one piece and then take the knife and then dip in jelly, spread it over the other piece. It's going to be harder with the peanut butter because peanut butter is real sticky and if your bread is really soft, it's going to tear so be really careful. And thing about a jelly is that it's really clumpy so it might take a while to smooth out everywhere and so then you just put the two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and jelly stick to each other and then you eat it.That's how you make peanut butter and jelly."

I worked on a machine, what's called software, like Windows and different things like that. And sometimes the students coming in would have a hard time. I couldn't communicate with them because I spoke on a higher level, if I'm making myself clear. My business was strictly all numbers, and theirs were phrases that the computer would turn, like write.Well, there was code for write the student coming in while the college graduate. Now they would code it in just common language, cobalt, and then it would go into the converter into the machine, the compiler, and that would bring it back into numbers. And I was more familiar with the write in the machine language than I was in the right that they were dealing with. And sometimes they didn't realize, and I don't know if you or anybody watching this understands, but there's a lot of conversion between the written instruction and by the time it gets down through in the machine language and that was the only problem I had. It didn't take long though, because those college kids in about six months do more than I did, so so what did you do to get over the miscommunication between I had to keep remembering that I had 33 years there.Okay, they might have three or four years in systems work, so it was a little difficult.

And at the same time, the king was angry because his son was all alone.

You take two slices of bread. Doesn't really matter what kind of bread, as long as it's not moldy. And you have a jar of peanut butter and you open it.You take a butter knife and you scoop out about as much as will fit on the butter knife. And you start on one edge of the bread and swipe across the bread. And make sure that you cover all of that side of the bread with peanut butter. And you put the peanut butter away and rinse off your knife. And then you get your jelly and you open it up and jelly is squiggly.So you got to kind of balance it, put it on the bread and then spread it out so that all the middle of the bread is covered.

It's cloudy outside. It just might rain today. The little boy says, oh, mom, it's not going to rain. They always say that.I don't need the umbrella. Mom says, okay. So he starts walking to school, and sure enough, the raindrops start coming down. Then it starts pouring. And the little boy says, Forget this.I'm going to turn around. I'm going to go back and get that umbrella. As he walks in the door, mom is looking at him, drenched in rain and says, what does Mama say? And the little boy says, Mama says I should listen when she tells me to do something. And mom gives the little boy his umbrella, and he starts walking to school with the umbrella over his."

But the two little girls were spoiled and they felt as though they were much superior to Cinderella. The master of the home, he sort of favored Cinderella, but because of this sinister aunt who would have been his sister and her two little girls, he was torn between the two. The master tried to make Cinderella happy in her home, but she wanted to go to the ball and the sinister aunt wanted her daughters to go because there was supposedly going to be a prince there and Cinderella didn't know whether she could go or not.And finally she was able to go. And involved in all this, there was supposedly a magic slipper made of glass, a crystal, and whoever was able to wear this slipper was going to be taken over. Not taken over, but to be part of the prince's life, the prince life. So they went to the ball and the sinister daughters tried the slipper on and it wouldn't fit. And lo and behold, Cinderella showed up and she was able to put the slipper on and they lived happily ever after."

And a year ago this last June, I'll never forget, I was taking a shower on a Sunday morning, getting ready to go to church and I started panning. I've never got a doctor before, just over and over I couldn't get out of that sharp fast enough and get dressed.So I called 911 and they took me into the hospital. And that night I went to the bathroom and I was vomiting going up and before I got back to my bed, nurse came running in. She says honey, if heal us, I feel okay. She said well, your heart just stopped for 6 seconds. And so with that very night they put a pacemaker in.I've been great shape ever since. I exercised a lot but I bought my Diablos up."

        "transcript": "Yes. My mother, who is 91 now, has vascular dementia, and so she has problems with her short term memory. So conversations with her are difficult in that she forgets what you've asked.The metaphor I always use is that she like that, sort of if you show her a stack of pictures, she will look through it endlessly and make relatively the same comments on each picture as you go until you stop her. And so, typically, conversations with her aren't exactly conversations. They are redirections, I would say. I try to prompt her to speak about something she does remember, and when she goes off, we just let her follow her thoughts wherever they go. And if she gets into a kind of sad place, then I try to redirect by pointing something out that distracts her, like, is that a bird out the window?And she'll begin someplace else. So it's not frustrating for her because I don't think she knows that she has this incapacity. I guess it is. So she's always in the moment. So I have learned the conversation with her is just about sort of keeping her mood where it is.So it doesn't feel like a conversation, but it's a nice but we clearly get to spend time together. It is harder, I have learned, via FaceTime when you can't physically touch her or anything to kind of redirect her. She wanders off, and then she forgets that she's talking to you.

And you take that knife and you stab it so that you feel less bad about scooping some out. So you scoop some out, and you spread it on one of the breads, which hopefully, at this point is cool enough that you can do that. Bread should be a little crunchy, but not toasted, per se.And so you spread that on there. You don't want too much, say, a centimeter of peanut butter. Maybe that's a little too thick, but that's the idea. You want, like, a decent amount of peanut butter, and then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you don't want to wash it off in the sink and get out another knife. It sounds like a lot of effort, let's be frank.And then you put the lid back on the peanut butter, put it back in the cabinet. You pull the jelly toward yourself. You unscrew that. You set the lid down. If it's new, you feel less bad about ruining it, because even though it's an equally perfect surface, it's kind of darker, and so it's not as pretty as the golden loveliness of the peanut butter.And so then what I like to do is I like to stab it also and stir it up a little bit, because it's easier to spread if you're not just, like, getting out a gloop of it. You stir it up some, get into a nice little liquidy consistency, but it's still jelly. And then you angle it over your second slice of bread. And then you take the knife to scrape some out. You can try to just scoop some out on top of the knife, but it'll fall off.Just scrape some out of the loose stuff and then spread that thinly on top. Not too thinly, little less than you did for the peanut butter, but not much. And then you take these pieces, and you take the peanut butter piece and you put it on top of the jelly piece because you don't want the jelly to fall off if you put it on top of the peanut butter piece. So right now you have the jelly sandwich, the jelly layers on the bottom, peanut butter layers on top."

Because in order to hear her of course people laugh at a Southern accent, but I don't think they have to work at understanding it. Maybe they do, maybe I'm not giving them. But to understand somebody who speaks with an accent even though they're speaking English, it makes you feel real silly.But I find that after a period of years, I can listen to a person speak with a strong English accent and for the most part catch what they say.But then we tried to do went to South America and went to Chile and studied Spanish before we went. And what I found out is I can't hear it even though I'd studied it, done a class and I thought I could say some things, but if I can't hear what you said to me, it makes no sense to me. It's not concocting in any way that I can concept what you said unless it's hello or goodbye. And it's not because it's just such patient that lets me know what you said to me.

And I just remember thinking, I don't know why I'm not getting help. Something's very wrong. And I just remember my dad came in, and what had happened was the internal bleeding was sitting on my chest, and it was compressing my lungs, so I couldn't breathe, and I was very scared, and I started saying something to whoever was in there.I can't breathe. I can't breathe. And I looked at my father's face, and it was a horrible thing. It's just a horrible thing. I'm here to tell the story, so it has a good ending, but it was very critical, and I was very scared and very frightened.And that doesn't do anything for trying to relax, so."

On the other hand, it's not necessary. It's whatever you feel like at the time.Well, having prepared the bread, the next thing we do is to start spreading. My way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first. Others do it differently, but this is how I recommend it. It works better this way. You can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread.Well, after that, a little bit of butter. Not too much, but some tends to help make the thing a little bit more moist than usual. And on top of that goes the jelly. Now, having done so, what a lot of people fail to have ever learned is regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have, peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth. Well, there's an easy way around that.Most people don't know my special secret. My special secret is lettuce. Nice leaves of iceberg, lettuce. Just a couple is just right to do it. And it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had.A lot of them. But I can tell you I'll tell."

It was five minutes.So we started out at five minutes, and then it was ten minutes that I could walk, and then it continued up until it was 30 minutes and I could walk faster. And it probably took me let's see, that was November, and in December, about a month later, I was out at the mall shopping for Christmas, because it was right before Christmas, and I had done no shopping, but I would just take it easy. And when I was tired, I would sit down and rest. And I had to do that for some time, but I did get my shopping done. I did a lot of gift certificates and that type of thing for all those grandkids, but I had a loan closing then, like, the last of December.And my boss, my broker, said, I can't believe you. He said, you mean you sold a house during this period? And I had, I had sold a house, but the person actually, it was a listing and my listings old, and the person I was working with was very kind and considerate, and he was scared to death I was going to do too much, and so he was very understanding.

Then I would go to the utensil drawer, get out a knife, open the two pieces of bread on a plate, take the knife, dig into the peanut butter jar, spread it over one slice of bread very nicely and uniformly. Then, if I did not want to mess up the jelly I would get a spoon out of the utensil drawer and take out a nice spoonful of jelly and put it on the other slice of bread.I could use the same knife and spread it around very uniformly. Then I would take and put the two pieces of bread together one with the peanut butter, one with the jelly. Once we had done that, I would then take the knife and slice it into two pieces. So we would have a sandwich, two sandwiches or one sandwich divided in two.

Deadhead means when they're towing a part of a train back to where it needs to be, there was a deadheaded presidential car being towed back to well, actually, I guess we wrote it the whole way it was going down to Florida because it wasn't just a DC. Well, we picked it up in DC. So we went all the way to Florida in that one.So we ended up being able to use the presidential car. And on the train, it was my son, my daughter, myself, and my husband. And we each had our own bed, our own bathroom.And it was just amazing to go to travel like that how I guess the rich and famous travel like that. But I said to my kids, enjoy it now because we're never probably going to ever do this again. It was amazing. And to lay in bed and watch as you're looking out the window at the scenery going by and we had two pillows each. It was just living it on the train.It was so nice.

Taking scoops of knifefuls of jelly out, spreading it on the other piece of bread.Folding the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and the jelly touching.

We took off on a hike, well equipped, with backpacks full of snacks, waters.It was a beautiful day, cool degrees, and we'd planned to spend the whole day, a lot of it. Our plans were based on Leo. He was more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy. So we went, not knowing where we were going. We just trusted him.We got along, had a snack, had been gone about two and a half hours and next thing you know, we're back on back on our hike, ready to head back to our destination. And we're lost. Three of us have absolutely no clue, no concept of where we are. We're surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look. So there really was no direction.And we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend, Leo. Leo doesn't panic. I started to feel a little panicked because I had twisted my knee a little bit. So I had a little compromised gait and it was a little tender, but I didn't want to complain and I knew there's nothing we could do about it. We just had to get back home.So for the first time, I really felt quite afraid that we might not make it. And what to do about my knee. We persevered. We trusted Leo. He went off on a couple wrong paths, but he got us back on track, got us back to the car.My leg was fine and it all ended very well. It was a great memory. We laughed about it. And I won't go hiking with Leo again. The end."

And the man inside could be his father, because it's outside near his house.And he gets scared because he sees this soccer ball coming at him and the window breaking. And he gets up very carefully because there's glass now on the floor. And he picks up the soccer ball, and he looks outside the broken window to see where it came from or who was there, and he sees his son had kicked it in there. Now he has to determine, what is he going to do. First of all, he knows he's going to see if the boy is all right and the boy was all right, and he's got to find someone to fix the window.And then he's going to tell the boy not to kick the ball near anything that's a window or something like that, to be kicking it in the other direction. He's teaching him a lesson, but he didn't get excited because accidents like that can happen. So he just teaches the boy, next time, don't do it. And I'm glad you're not hurt. The glass can be fixed, and we'll clean up here and get that all straightened out.So the thing is, there was a telephone. I worked for the New York Telephone Company."

But moving was getting incredibly hard since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away.I sat down and said, I'm just going to sit here. Can you go home and have your mom call my mom and have her come and pick me up? When my mom came to pick me up, she felt that I had a fever. Took me to the hospital, and they found out that I had meningitis. And I was in the hospital for four days.It might have been five, I can't remember. I was seven, okay. And they gave me a spinal tap. And that's terrifying because they have you laying on your side. And here I was, seven, saying, now don't move.This will hurt, but don't move. You might end up paralyzed. Well, that certainly calmed me right down. But with the exception that they bring in the flavored Pops whenever I want it from the nursing station, the refrigerated like fruit drink things that are frozen, that was okay, but they didn't turn the TV on for my room until the day I left.

So I was supposed to be collecting interviews with people who had had those experiences. And when I first arrived in the area that I had chosen, I had a great deal of trouble getting anybody to want to talk to me. I learned later it was because some rumors had gone around about what this information was going to be used for. But there was a Navajo ceremony going on at the time.And I learned about this. And I realized from long experience on the reservation that if you're ever going to find a large population of people without very much to do, it's at the Sing, as we call them. So I went to the location of the Sing and I set up shop under a pinot entry and I started trying to find people to talk to. Well, before very long, the lead medicine man singer, as we call him, who was conducting the ceremony inside the Hut Hogan, learned about this and he came out and asked me what was going on. And I explained why I was there and why this information was being collected and what was to do.And he was very favorable. And so he asked me if I would come that night to the evening ceremony when everybody's standing in a big circle around a fire and make a speech and explain about what I was doing there and why. And so I came, and I was the only white person there and I made this speech about and explaining the reason for my survey and what the information was to be used for. And I was actually, believe it or not, given a round of applause afterward. And from that time onward, I never had any trouble getting interviews.People were very anxious to come and talk to. So that stands on my mind as an experience."

And when one wanted to feed him, he pushed her hand away.And it got to the point where I realized that they couldn't handle it and I couldn't handle it. And that's when he went into a nursing home. And he remained there, and he deteriorated quite a bit. He forgot how to walk. He forgot how to teach, to feed himself.He didn't remember where to put the shoes, whether on his feet or on his hands. And so they took good care of him. He was always neatly dressed and clean out of bed until it reached the point where he stopped eating. And he eventually passed away peacefully."

And I decided I would go to England for a few months in September, and I said I'll be back for Christmas. I got there and I liked England and parts of Europe so much that I decided to stay and stay. So I stayed for two years. Probably the center part of all of that was when I made a trip from France to Greece.Hitchhiking with a friend. We hitchhiked across southern France, through Italy, into Yugoslavia, south Yugoslavia, living off the land, as it were found. People were very generous and offering his rides in the car. Some of us sleep in their backyard. Two or three of them invited us in to spend the night.When we got to Greece, we in some ways found ourselves part of what was called a Greco American Friendship society. So we got to travel all around the Peloponnesis and stay with people every night. And our only job was to kind of communicate friendship in the part of the United States. And following that experience, we took a train back to Paris and then to England, and then we have another."

In other words, they didn't pay much attention to those with disabilities and he hadn't had no school. He was about 20 years old and I decided I'd see if I could teach him to read. He was very intelligent, but he just never had the opportunity. He came from a poor family and they didn't know what to do.And I got him up to the 6th grade level of reading. He could read the sport page, which he dearly loved basketball, football and that sort of thing. Horribly crippled and lived to be in his thirty s. And then he died. But I did that just and really I wasn't going to be a reading teacher.I just thought I would try to see what I could do with him. And I got him where he could read the newspaper pretty well.

One down in hospital, special surgery in the city and a year later, PT three days a week, OT two days a week. I eventually saw an acupuncturist. I went to a chiropractor with very limited chiropractic stuff and then in greater, more typical at a year and a half, trying to think did I try anything else? So a lot of PT, a lot of OT exercises at home every day.I mean, in the winter when they had slow days at the PT place, some days they kept me for like 5 hours because it was just so ridiculous.

And after visiting a physical therapist and a physician, learned that I had torn three of the four muscles in the rotator cup in my left shoulder. And this necessitated a rather extensive surgical procedure. The lady who operated on me, Dr. Stacey Grossfeld, said that it was worse than she thought when she got in to do the repair and that the repair she did would hurt for approximately one year.And she was right. I know for a fact that it hurt for 51 weeks and two days, and then it stopped hurting. And since then, my shoulder is completely recovered. And it is."

And I'd had a car accident earlier that year, so I thought maybe it was related to that. But since it had been several months since the car accident, my doctor decided to do an x ray, and they found out that the bone, the joint was actually dying because I had what was called avascular necrosis, or osteo necrosis, where the blood supply to the joint, for whatever reason, dies or gets cut off. So since it was so far along, they said that the only thing that was left to do was to have a total hip replacement.So we set up the appointment, or the specialist set up the appointment with the hospital for the date of surgery. And I went into the hospital. And this is the first time I'd ever been in a hospital. I'd never really been sick or anything in my life. So they put me under, and I actually kind of woke up before they were completely finished.But they have what they call nerve blockers, so I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. But they were finishing up, and I was, like, looking around, and the doctor was kind of surprised. He's like, oh, just be calm. We're almost done. And so then after that, they wheeled me into the recovery room, where I kind of came more out of the anesthetic.And then I spent two days in the hospital before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home. And then, really, the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work. And then it was a year before they said I was completely healed.

And so we were over there just at a party. And so he had been practicing going off the board. It was just a little board, but he had been practicing doing that, and he wanted to do that, but then he got scared just as he started to jump off and he jumped toward the side, and so he hit his chin on the side and it just opened it up.

Eventually they'll make a point of telling you somehow you figure it out. Some form of sign language, of anything.Okay, so can you give me an example of something that you did with him? Yeah, to try to be able to understand him? Well, we have our own little sign language right now. I don't know why, but every time he sees me, he goes, that's the grandma that does this, I guess.And then right away it means getting a cookie out of the drawer. So he knows, he understands. Like I'm the one that gives him the cookies all the time.But it's fun. Yeah. I guess when he wants us sip of water.

So it's trauma event where my grandfather passed away and he was not sick. He went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work, so he went off on a normal day. And I remember playing with my friends in the beautiful summertime, just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital.And a friend of mine and I put some cookies together for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with death. So it's kind of a sad story but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the cycle of birth and death and whatnot. So it turned out that he passed away that night and I never did see him again. And I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life. And then looking back on it as an adult now realizing that this man really was an angel of mine.I didn't realize it then but came to believe. And I don't know if you want to know about my personal beliefs, but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there came to learn about that and it just served as a real learning in my life in many different ways."

And then we did about a year of outpatient PT and got to about that. She was not as cooperative with that.She found it very uncomfortable. Right. And we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress, especially given that she was not willing to work at home besides doing range of motion exercises, which she does twice a day, totally on her own. She's very good about that. So we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function, she could stay out of physical therapy.And she's doing that, but we continue to do speech therapy.

Actually, my eyelashes came back, but they're about one third of what they used to me. I lost 30 pounds, and that was not from being sick, because I was not sick. I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo or my radiation. I lost it because something in the chemotherapy gave me a very bad taste in my mouth.It tasted like I was chewing on pennies when you were a kid, put a penny in your mouth and felt that taste. That's what everything tasted like to me, no matter what it was. And so food just didn't really have much of an appeal. But I'm diabetic, so I had to eat. But I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check.So I lost 30 pounds, which was not a bad thing. I wish I could have kept it off. Unfortunately, once we got the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation, it took about two and a half years. But I gained all the weight back, and I go in two weeks back to my oncologist from my five year checkup. And at that time, if all seems well, I don't have to go back anymore."

And if you try to talk to them, you get one word answers.So I think that's a problem. I think that they really are losing the ability to socially converse. And from what I see from my grandkids, they even get a slight bit irritated if you try to carry on a conversation with them. Sometimes they're fine, but it just depends if it's something that they really want to talk about or get off their chest or politics or the world or something like that, then they will express their feelings. But I have a tendency to ask a lot of questions and a lot of the time the answer is I don't.Yeah, communicating with the younger generation is a problem because they're so used to this shorthand talk and stuff when they text and do Facebook and email and all this other stuff."

There was a big event, a ball that was going on in town, and Cinderella really wanted to go, but because her stepmom and stepsisters always bugged her, she had to stay home and clean. So she made a wish that she would be able to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother showed up and with a little hocus pocus magic, gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, a carriage, some dudes to drive the carriage. So she went to the ball, she met the prince.One of the rules that she had to follow was that all this was going to disappear at midnight. But so she kind of lost track of time. She was dancing with the prince. Midnight struck and she took off. She dropped her slipper, she took off.She made it home, everything changed and she kind of hit. Nobody really knew who was at the ball. The prince was enamored with who he was dancing with and he put out a call to find out who it was. So he set up this thing where everybody could try on the one slipper. And it was a glass slipper.It's a pretty unique piece of footwear. And so he was trying to find this person that he was dancing with and everybody was trying it on. It didn't fit. The stepsisters were trying to jam their big dumb feet into it. They couldn't do it.Cinderella kind of meekly said, Can I try? And she did fit. Everybody was happy. They got married and they lived happily ever."

        "transcript": "Well, I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from New Mexico to the East Coast. It was such an immense change culturally. And also we lived in a very rural area in New Mexico, up in the mountains. Lived in Taos, which is the biggest town that we lived in, which is not a very big town at all. So when we came here, it was absolutely shocking.I mean, just the fact that they had sidewalks all over the place, it just amazed us. And the street lamps and everything. I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east is so much more money, it's so much richer and they can afford to do all of that. We had a lot of unpaved roads out there. Of course there's a lot sparser population, so a lot of times they're not going to pave these huge long roads all over the place.But here it was just amazing to us. All the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city. It was just indescribable the impact that it had on us. I think it took us years to really kind of overcome the culture shock. I remember that period of my life all the time.Just the immense change that we underwent. In fact, we had Spanish accents, very heavy. My parents always did their whole life. But we had such a terrible time at school, people teasing us and everything and we really tried hard to emulate English speakers especially. I used to listen to David Niven.For some reason I was really crazy about him. And I wanted to sound like a really had a huge impact on us. Each in our own way."

There was a cat that was walking outside when all of a sudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree. A little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree and started crying that her cat wouldn't come back down.Dad came out to see what all the commotion was about and saw that he could get the cat back down by grabbing a ladder from his garage and climbing up the tree to get the cat.

I can read them fairly well, but often had difficulty conversing with people.One of the problems is asking directions. You can work yourself up a set of directions and ask them and say French or Portuguese. The problem is always in the answer, which you don't understand. The temptation is to say to the person who's giving you the directions.

And our bedroom was a long hall way that had to go down and past a set of stairs that went up to basically the attic, which was also livable up there. But no one lived up there.So at night, when we would go to bed, we had windows that the cars coming down the road would the headlights would make, like, marching soldiers along the wall. And I would lay there and try to go to sleep, and I would see those soldiers marching along from the headlights, which were somewhat frightening. But then I would go to sleep and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the stairs. And since the bottom of the stairs was right on the other side of the door to our bedroom, I was always worried they were going to come into our bedroom and drag us back up the stairs. And my parents were so far away because their bedroom was next to the main part of the house and there was no way to get there except going by those stairs and down the hall.So I lived several years in fear. I never slept well in that bedroom. And eventually we tore that house down and built a new house. And I was so happy because I didn't like sleeping over there.

And I was with my new partner at the time, and he comes up to me and was like, hey, I want you to introduce me to your new guy. And I'm like, that's kind of strange and formal, because they also knew each other too. They had classes together, so that kind of formalism wasn't very necessary.Yeah, and it was very uncomfortable. But I went up to my partner and I was like, hey, so he, for whatever reason, wants to meet you. And he's like, I don't see the point in that. I don't know why he's trying to be like a big man. It's very unnecessary.During this conversation, I then see that my ex is talking with my brother, and I was."

All of the medication that I was required to take, I took all of it.It was a good girl. And for a while, I kept listening to my body and not trying to do too many things. And when I realized that I was starting to get tired, then it was time for me to just stop and say, it will still be there tomorrow, and it's okay. I just need to pace myself, and I can move forward. Even if it's slowly, I'll get this done.It may take time, but I can eventually make this happen. But it's better that I take the time now rather than killing myself by trying to do too much. Right?"

Can you tell me what the problems were and what you did about them?Yes, my first experience was back in the late 1990s. I worked with a physical and occupational therapist with a Hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges. And the purpose of therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they had been, but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse. So that was my first experience, was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that could not be understood. And the kids were great, and they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do, they would just start to cry.And you'd have to be able to tell, or, I learned how to tell, which were really tears of pain and which were tears of just like, I don't want to do this. And now, of course, fast forward to here. This has been an amazing experience, working with both children and adults who have had strokes, who are unable to communicate in what they're doing to make themselves better. And I've taken cues from the people with whom I'm working, what not to do and what to do, and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps."

So it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't hear what you're saying to her most of the time. In order for me to communicate with her, I have to get in front of her and speak directly to her. I think she's become very adept at reading lips and figuring out what you're saying without hearing it. But I noticed if I would come up behind her, my husband and I could carry on a full conversation, she would never turn around.So that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad. She now has the beginnings of basically Alzheimer's of the dementia type. So in addition to the difficulty hearing, she also has difficulty remembering. And you can see her now and see her again in 30 minutes and she won't remember that she saw you 30 minutes ago. Usually as a normal rule, she does recognize us and is able to communicate at her level with that.But basically we've learned that we have to be in front of her to be able to communicate with her. Otherwise you're having to repeat everything so many times you don't know if she's heard you or not. So that's about all you can do with that is just make sure you have face to face communication."

So we get up to the top of the hill, and there happens to be a cop car.And the cop gets out, and there's two cops, and one of them goes down with the guy laying in the street, and the other guy stays with us. And what happened? And the friend tells the story about how he got punched. And the cop asks, well, what happened to that guy down there? And my husband says, he got stabbed.And the cop says, well, how did he get stabbed? And my husband very calmly says, I stabbed him. And we just looked at him. We were just totally shocked. And, yeah, my husband had a pocket knife and pulled it out and stabbed this guy.And he the guy was okay. He spent a lot of time in jail. He had assault charges in several states, but we all ended up okay. Besides, the guys had some black eyes and a couple of stitches.

And I do remember that it was horrible, them trying to get me to drink because I didn't want anything. I just was so nauseous.That was it. They gave me antinaga medicine. So the nausea finally started to settle. My mother and my husband would come into the bedroom and beg me to drink and offer me absolutely anything. They would go anywhere in the world to find something that I would drink.And it was like force feeding for me to drink something. But I finally did, and within several days, eventually, I turned a corner and got better. Told you a lot. Way more than you wanted to know."

It's raining heavily. Mom, I need my umbrella.Okay, I told you you needed to take the umbrella. Here you are. Now get to school before you're late.All right. And this is the last thing for this section.Do I get to sing Bibbity Bobbity Boop? If you want. You don't want. This is a picture book telling the story of Cinderella. The book is without words, so the person can tell the story in their own way.Look through the book to remind yourself of how the story goes. You can use what you already know about the story as well as the pictures in the book to tell your story. When you're ready, I'll put the book away, and then you can tell me the story in your own.Once upon a time, long, long ago, in the land of make believe, there was a man who had lost his wife but had a young daughter. A sweet young gal, a sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella. He decided it was time that he took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella, because she needed a woman. As she was growing up, she needed a mother. And so he married a widow, a lady who did not have a husband, but had two young daughters.The woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her. And she banished her to the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs, and her own two little girls, who were really nasty little brats, got to sit around, get lots of new clothes, and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked. But she had her little cat, who she loved, and the cat kept her company and helped as much as she could.And this went on. Daddy was completely unaware."

Tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end, and you can start whenever you're ready. Well, cats up in the tree, they get stuck in trees, I guess. I've heard stories like that.I guess it's the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help. The little girl looks like she's ready to catch the cat. The little dog, of course, wants the cat down for different reasons. And then the fire department shows up, which they're good like that. They've got the ladder, and all is well.Okay, I'm going to ask you to tell a story. Now. Have you ever heard the story of Cinderella? I have, but not in years. Okay, well, I might be a little foggy on some of the details.Cinderella the book. Okay, take a look at all the pictures in the book, and afterwards I'll put the book away and then ask you to tell me the story in your own words.It okay. I still am fuzzy on a lot of those details. Okay, now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can, and you can use any details you know about this story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Okay, so Cinderella is sent to live with a family, and she is basically a maid. And they're the two stepsisters.I think it's the wicked stepsisters. If I recall, they were rather homely. And Cinderella, of course, is very pretty, and she's very sweet and helpful. And these two are kind of spoiled and not very pleasant. And there's going to be a ball, and I believe invitations go out and the two sisters are going to go to the ball, and Cinderella is not invited.And somehow the fairy godmother steps in, and Cinderella ends up with, well, it's all know, right? The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach. And by dint of luck and good favor from the fairy godmother, cinderella does go to the ball. I believe the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight, so she's dancing with the prince, having a wonderful time."

So the ENT said him to the audiologist and the audiologist was in this little glass room, know, stuffed animals that moved and symbols and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this. And she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass because before she moved the drums, he was so smart.She looked at the drums and then she looked at him and then she moved the drums. And then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey at the symbol and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway, the ENT and I get into it in a big loud way because he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests.Anyway, we go through. So finally he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with a speech language pathologist. He was 2.8, I think, at that time. That fall.I'll never forget the first session, Madison. I was like, this is never going to work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early 30s. She looked like Cinderella.Blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him to the verge of tears every sessions. We were private pay.She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate the session. And she worked wonders.And we ate, drank and slept. Letters and sounds, that sheep in the Jeep book, alphabet cereal alphabet, pasta. It was like crazy town. So we did that with private pay with her. And then at three years old, the town would pick him up.So I thought, as a small town, we should at least have him have connections with that SLP just in case, with funding. And Susan Rose said, he has met whatever markers you guys can't would be not ready for me to take your money anymore. He was initially when she met him, consultation. He was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder, which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she dismissed him, you're good.He's all good to go. I was real paranoid and she's the only thing is 50% of the children with this diagnosis, the way they're taught traditionally taught how to read in public schools. They're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that know have to I don't know what? Go to private school, get another read.I didn't know what we were going to do. Madison. But I was like, So, anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP who had just graduated Madison. She was lovely, so sweet.He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on. Every time we went in there. She was so sweet.She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave. He would look at me and smile. Oh, my gosh. It was terrible.And then she went off to I don't know where. And then he got an experienced older woman who, again, cracked the whip with him. Tracy O'guerra."

Pacifier has her coat, hat and gloves on, starts at the door and tells Carl, who is big dog, to take your baby. Carl puts his hands up on the windowsills, looks out, watches to make sure the mother is gone.The baby is now standing up in the bed looking very expectantly at the dog. Dog walks over to the crib. The baby steps out onto the dog's back and they're off across the hallway to mother's bed where they have a wonderful time playing on the big bed in mother's bedroom. Then they move to the dresser where the baby puts powder on the dog's nose, has the jewelry out. The next picture has the jewelry and the top of the powder box draped on the dog's head and the baby has a handkerchief and a pin cushion on his head.Those breezes are blowing gently in the window curtains and the furniture in the room the size of furniture has changed. The jewelry box was suddenly a whole lot larger then the next scene. The baby is obviously in the hallway or in the bathroom is sitting on the edge of the laundry chute. The basket of clothes is beside the laundry chute. The dog, after seeing her baby sitting on the edge of the laundry chute runs way down the stairs, down into the top of the basement stairs.Look at the baby who's sitting happily on top of the dirty laundry after having fallen all the way down the laundry chute, goes down into the basement. The baby gets back on his back and they go back upstairs and he starts across the floor, running film mal sliding on a rug, which then upsets table in the living room scatters papers all over the floor and then goes up to the large aquarium that in one picture is sitting beside a window and in the next picture, the window is not there anymore. Anyway, the baby and the dog look at the aquarium. The next thing you see he has the baby by the shirt and is dunking the baby in the aquarium. And that baby is paddling along with his nose barely out of the water through all the fishies in the aquarium.The next thing the dog has the baby out of the aquarium sitting on the rug and has turned on the music and the dog is dancing to the radio and the baby is waving his hands in time to the music.The next scene, they have gone into the refrigerator which the baby can reach from the dog's back, opens the door. The dog gets out a loaf of bread and gives and the lady takes out a stick of butter out of a box of butter and starts opening it."

When I was pregnant with my first child and and I read this book by Jenny McCarthy about when she was pregnant with her child and she ate all these brownies. And I thought, wow, look at her. She looks great.I'm going to eat lots of brownies too. That was a big mistake because I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time. And then my blood pressure went really high. And towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up with toxemia. And so they realized it when I had woken up one morning with like it was probably beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything.My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill my it was like a pulsating thing in my head. And I went in and I had to the clinic, which was close to my house, and I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often and it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken, then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and talk really fast and write everything down that he says, and then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day I came in, went to pee in the cup and then went to go to take my blood pressure.And I'd have to sit at this machine and it takes your blood pressure and prints it out, and then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did. I went put it in there, printed it out, I handed it to the nurse and she was just like, no, you have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay. So I do it again and it prints it out and it's just as high.So they are so irritated with me by this point, like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse, who's the professional, right, does it and realizes, holy crap, this woman's got like, really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away. And they said, we're checking you in right now because this is very serious.And they checked and they had like, I don't know, what is it, like sugar or something in my urine? So there's all kinds of problems happening with me, unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet. And after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down. But then they said, well, we could send you home, but we're not 100% sure that you could control this.So we think we should induce you because I was far enough along. And so it was a Tuesday morning, and they said, at 530 in the morning, we're going to bring you down to induce you. And this is kind of gross, but they made me take a suppository, which just really, everything's clean. But the fun part was that it was in a room where there were other people."

It's just really hard to tell from this picture, but hopefully they all get safe and get out of there. Little Boy is outside playing soccer and kicks it, unfortunately, with his toe rather than the side of his foot. Ball goes crashing through a living room window, knocks over a lamp in the house, and the gentleman in there jumps, stands up, picks up the ball, looks out the window and sees it's his favorite little neighbor kid, so he's not going to be too hard on him.Goes out, gives him the ball, and has him mow the grass to work off the price of the window.Looks like mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella. And mom keeps it. Little Boy smiling, though, says goodbye. He's walking to school and it starts to sprinkle, and then it starts raining harder. So he turns around, goes back home.Can I back up? Okay. Little boy says, no, Mom, I don't want to take the umbrella. I'm not a sissy. And Mom's angry because she really wants him to, because she can see them.It is going to rain no matter what. So he runs back home, shows Mommy's all wet, and says, okay, I guess I'll take that umbrella after all. And then he heads back to school in the rain, happy that he's got the umbrella. Okay, Cinderella. Walt Disney.Cinderella. There once was a little girl, a beautiful little girl whose mother had died, and her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her. Unfortunately, he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom, and she had two spoiled rotten little girls. And then, unfortunately, he also passed away. So the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work, all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the sewing.And she didn't have anyone to talk to. So she made friends with the animals. She'd go out and feed them, and they'd talk together, and they were her companions. One day, the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife. So he sent out an invitation to all the eligible young women in the land.And the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it. And her daughters were so happy, and they know, okay, sure, Cinderella, you can go, but you don't have anything to wear. So the little animals made her dress. They made it look beautiful. They sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do, there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball.So when it was time to leave, she came down and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be. And they said, oh, Cinderella, that's my scarf and my necklace. Ripped the things off because they said she stole it from them, even though they'd thrown the stuff away earlier. So now she really does have nothing to wear, and they take off and she's in the garden crying."

        "transcript": "Them. Okay, so the story begins with young girl who lives with her father. As in many of the stories, the mother seems to be missing and has died or something like that. The father decides to remarry to a woman known in the story as the stepmother, wicked stepmother, who happens to have two daughters, the stepsisters, and they move in and after which point I think I've forgotten the actual order of it, but it seems like something happens with the father and it's just the four of them. And the Cinderella doesn't really have anyone anymore.She just has the animals who are her friends because otherwise she's cleaning the house and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters. And they take care they kind of are quite selfish and do whatever they want. And then from there, oh, there's the castle, far, far away. And one day they hear the stepmother hears of this announcement she reads in the book about how oh, yes, it looks like the prince is looking for someone to marry and they're going to have all of these young women come to the castle for a ball. So Cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the no, no, that one was made by herself.And then she goes and gets ready to go. And then the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are ready to go, but then they say, oh, no, you're not going to go. And they rip all of her clothes off. And then she's crying and very upset and goes upstairs and is in her room. And then I think this part is a little bit hazy.Maybe she goes out to a garden, actually, and that's when she meets her fairy godmother. And it seems like she sings a song with bippity boppity boo. Is that it? Or maybe another fairy tale. Anyway, so she waves her wand and then her dog becomes does her dog become a horse or one of the Carriagemen?And then the mice turn into something and then the pumpkin becomes her carriage. And then the rule was that after at midnight, you must be out of there because the magic will wear off. And she also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown and glass slippers. And then she goes off to the castle or the palace. And of course the prince immediately falls in love with her and wants to dance with her all night long.And the stepsisters and the stepmother do not even recognize her or everyone is watching and saying, who is that beautiful young woman? We don't know who she is. And then this clock starts to strike midnight and so she has to run out and she leaves the prince alone. And one of the prince's helpers goes chasing after her. And she's running down the stairs very quickly, loses one of her glass slippers and then goes charging away to get back to the house.And then the magic wears off and she suddenly is just Cinderella.

You don't have the bread.You put it on a plate. You take some peanut butter, you take a knife, you spread it onto one piece of bread. You take out the jelly, take the knife, spread the jelly onto the other piece of bread, put the pieces of bread together and cut the salmon in half. I had flu symptoms. Started throwing up.I got on a plane, flew cross country, thought it was better. Got more sick, strep throat, feeling fever, chills. Went on for days. Tried to get better again. Developed a cough.Went to the doctor. He said it was a respiratory inspection after the salute.I have an uncle who's from rural Appalachia and he has no teeth and he has a thick, thick accent. And she was chewing tobacco. And when he speaks, it sounds like a long slur of almost vowels. When he mumbles, it's almost impossible to discern what he's saying. What did you do about it?You have to listen really intently. I'm kind of used to the accent. If you're not used to the accent, you're not familiar with it. Between the lack of teeth, chewing tobacco in his mouth and the accent, you'll never figure out what he's saying.So I was river rafting and West Virginia, and there's this part where you get out of the raft and jump into a hydro, which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom. If you jump into the whirlpool, even with the light jacket on, it'll suck you to the bottom of the river. Normally, it spits you up five to 10ft after it sucks you down. If you hit it just perfectly, you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro and it takes you up about 50ft. I was about the fifth person to do it.The first four people jumped in and popped up 10ft later, I jumped in, hit it perfect and it carried me down to the bottom, dragged me on, started to pop me up about 10ft, sucked me back down. And I sucked in a big gulp of water as I came to the surface. Thought I was coming back down. I was about a foot from the surface. I could see the light, and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another 40ft.I thought I was going to drown. Had a light jacket on. It sucked me to the bottom.So there was a girl who got caught in a river.Doesn't look like a flood. Looks like she maybe fell in a river because they're not taking boats or anything. And there's what looks like either a cop or a fireman. He's got harness to safety equipment, safety lines, and he's wearing a life jacket and he's trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl.Kid was going to school. His mother told him to take an umbrella. He insisted. He didn't want to bring the umbrella. He didn't need it.He went to school. It started raining. He got upset and came home was soaking wet. His mother was upset that she didn't even listen to her. He changed the dry clothes, took the umbrella and left.Kid was playing soccer. He kicked his soccer ball through the window. It hit a lamp, broke the lamp. The guy inside the house jumped up, grabbed the soccer ball and looked out to see who kicked it.Anything else? No. There was a man who had a daughter named Cinderella. He was a widower. He married a new, evil, cruel woman who had two daughters of her own.The father then died, and the girl was raised by her stepmother and her two cruel stepsisters who made her do all the work and clean the house.One day the king was yelling at his son about how he needed to get married. So he was going to throw a ball and order all the single women in the kingdom to come. Cinderella and her sisters got the invitation. Cinderella was not allowed to go. Her sisters went.She was forced to stay home. The mice and the birds, though, felt sorry for her because they liked her. So they came and made her a dress and all the accessories so she could go. The sisters came home and found out about this and destroyed it. She was very sad.Then they left to go to the ball. Her fairy godmother came, made her a dress and gave her a coach and told her she had to be back till midnight, where everything went back to the way it was. She went to the ball. She."

        "transcript": "But meanwhile the nice daughter, stuck with all the terrible chores in the household, is visited by a fairy godmother who realizes that there's a big problem and she decides that she needs to help. And she gives the pretty, nice and badly treated daughter a beautiful dress and takes her to the ball. And of course the prince sees that there's this beautiful and virtuous woman who he's never met before and he wants to know who she is. And they dance and they have a wonderful time. But pretty soon the clock shows it's almost midnight and according to the legal stipulations of her contract with the fairy godmother, she must be home before twelve or else her beautiful carriage, drawn by the goofiest horses ever, will suddenly turn into a pumpkin.It's rather hard to get home in a pumpkin. So she rushes home and at some point the carriage does turn into a pumpkin. I believe I've kind of lost it there. But she gets home and on the way home she lost one of her beautiful slippers. And she doesn't realize it at the time, but that's actually a good thing to lose a slipper, because in the following days the prince, who's very upset because this woman who was the most charming and wonderful woman at the ball, he would like to see her again, he'd like her to become princess.But she vanished and the only thing left is the slipper that she lost. Unfortunately, it didn't hit anything hard on the ground or it would have just been a pile of glass shards. But he has a slipper and he makes the rounds of every household in the country. Of course not including the lower class ones, or the households that were owned by immigrants or foreigners who had been living there but couldn't become citizens, or any of the other rifraf, but just the households with eligible women who could, by means of class, be his princess. And when they get to where our heroine lives, the bad women try on the slipperer and of course it doesn't fit, but it fits on our heroine, who is then understood to be the woman that the prince danced with at the ball.And then all is well with the world."

        "transcript": "Can remember a time when I worked a double shift, which means I worked my regular shift and then I worked a night shift. And then I was invited to go to a party where a friend of mine purchased a home.So she wanted me to see her house and her friends were all going to be there. So I went over and had a good time. I was tired, had one glass of wine. I can remember had one glass of wine, I had some tamales, I had beans and rice and a salad. And after that I just started really getting sleepy and tired.So I said I had to get going home. So I went home, I rolled the window down, I started dozing off a little bit and then I continued going home. At that time I lived in Upland and Upland has Euclid Avenue. It's a long street that goes north up to Mount Baldi. Well, I just lived in the foothills of Mount Baldi, so all these trees and everything, I was passing by, it was in the evening, real late in the evening, maybe like 01:00 in the morning.And all I can remember was waking up and the police officer was asking me questions and I remember it was blurry.And then I don't remember anything else after that. Then I woke up again and I was in the hospital and I woke up and there was patches all over my face. I couldn't barely see out of only one eye because my other face was covered. What happened is I ran into a telephone post and I had cuts. I still have a scar here.I had my fingers, my thumbs. I was holding the steering wheel like this. And when I hit the telephone post, I bent the steering column upward and I remember breaking through the glass with my hands. And luckily I didn't break my thumbs. I guess it got hit mostly on this arm.It pushed in this area. So that doctor stated that I didn't break my thumb because I was able to use this part of arm. But what I did do with a force and I was wearing a seatbelt, but I ended up twisting my upper torso, so I was so much in pain they fixed my oh, by the way, I cut my face somehow I tore my face right in here. I had to have plastic surgery and I had to go to a chiropractor because I couldn't even pick up my shield. So I went to a chiropractor and he took an x ray and my spine was like an S with the force of hitting that telephone post.So it took me about six months. I had acupuncture and the chiropractor was straightening my spine, pulling and tugging. He told me it was going to hurt and he gave me exercises to do with weights so I could walk straight and keep my posture straight. I was very lucky I didn't break my back."

        "transcript": "This little delinquent is playing irresponsibly in somebody else's front yard because he has previously broken his own window and his mom yelled at him. And so history repeats itself. He kicks the ball through somebody else's front window, lands in the dude's lap where he's sitting innocently on his sofa trying to read the newspaper. He doesn't have a newspaper, but it knocks over a lamp, which is is further damage that this little punk is going to have to pay for. And the man picks up the ball, goes to the window and looks out, but the kid has already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences.Okay, thank you. You're welcome.Okay, so here is another set of sequences, and again, you can take a look at the pictures. Take your time, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Small Child has a history of violent behavior, and so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checked weather.com this morning, and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain, so he's probably okay. So the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds onto the umbrella, and lo and behold, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain. And he's dismayed because not only was he right, he also now doesn't have an umbrella. And so he runs back home and he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he's not allowed to say, I told you so.And his mother relents and gives him an umbrella with which to walk to school, but he's already wet, so it's kind of immaterial at this point. Poor small child. You should not hit people with things. This wouldn't happen. All right.And this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again, with a beginning, a middle and an end. All right.It was a nice morning, and this bird was in the tree singing, at which point the cat thought to itself, I'm a cat. I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential. And so the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow, and the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he can't get down, so he may as well look like he did it on purpose.At which point, the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself, that cat needs rescuing because I am nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat, but the cat is too scared to come down and is certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms because it's a cat. They're ornery. And so the girl goes and gets her dad and the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there and he's not really about that.So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat. It's just a stray dog. It lives by the school that goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet. It's a nice dog. But it sees the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident.And so the man is stuck in the tree even though he could jump. That's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking, barking up the right tree. And so he pulls his cell phone out of his pocket. It's probably a flip phone, maybe a Nokia, like something really sturdy.He looks like an old fashioned kind of guy."

He's playing soccer, and he's kicking the ball, and unfortunately, he kicks it through, like, his neighbor's window, which seems to shock his neighbor, who knocks over the vase, and it wakes him up from sleeping or he's watching TV or something. It shocks him, and he's not expecting it. And then he's looking out the window with the ball to see who the perpetrator is, I assume. All right, great.We're going to do the same thing with these. Just take a look at them, and then whenever you're ready, a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, little boy. The woman's son is refusing an umbrella, as mother is saying he may need for today. He's like, I'll be fine without it.And then, of course, it starts to rain on him, and he's not appreciating the rain too much. And he comes home, and his mother sees that he is sucking wet. He comes back for the umbrella, I assume, and then he gets the umbrella and goes his merry way. All right, great. Same thing with this one.It's a little bit different. It's kind of an entire scene, so you want to look at the whole picture, and then a story with the beginning, a middle, and an end. Whenever you are ready. Hey, it looks like the little girl's cat got up the tree and her father or older brother or somebody climbed up the tree to try to rescue the cat, and then he unfortunately, also became stuck. And so they had to call the fire department out there to rescue both the cat and the father from the all right, great.All right. Have you ever heard of Cinderella? Yes. Okay, so I'm going to have you look through this book, okay? There are no words in here, just the pictures, but I want you to take as much time as you need to look through all the pictures.And then whenever you're ready, I'm going to take the book back and have you tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story as well as the pictures that you just looked at. Okay. Cinderella seems to be brought to apparently she has no parents or something. She's brought to her aunt's house or something like that to live, and she's made to be used as a maid, which she waits on her two cousins and her aunt and takes care of the animals and all that.And it appears that her two cousins are invited to a party, a ball of some sort, I guess. And they're excited about going to the ball, and she has no clothes but little mice and stuff, and birds make a dress for her. And so she goes to the ball in the chariot, which I guess that was her fairy godmother or something, gave her the chariot."

        "transcript": "Little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died. After which her father married a second time to a middle aged woman who he fell in love with, who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters. Poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother, her stepmother and the daughters. She did all the ironing, the cleaning and everything else. And because she was such a nice person, she did it willingly because she had a good heart.One day the old king approached his son and said, it's about time you got married. I'm going to throw a ball, and you, I hope, will find your future wife at the ball. The prince wasn't too keen on the idea, but finally he agreed. When the stepmother and the ugly sisters found out about this ball, they tried their level best to make themselves look as well as they could. They bought new clothes, they did their hair, they made themselves as presentable as they could.Cinderella, in the meantime, looked out of her window and saw the castle where the big ball was taking place, and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball. She was helped by her little friends, the mice and the owl. And they all said, oh, Cinderella, why don't you try and contact your fairy godmother? She might be able to help you. Well, Cinderella said, I don't know how to do that.And they said, well, look in the trunk. There's a book in the trunk. If you read how to find your fairy godmother, she might turn up and be able to help you. And she did that. And wham, the fairy godmother approached and said, cinderella, you shall go to the mall.And she suddenly, with her magic, was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made out of a pumpkin and coachman. She changed the mice into coachman and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress. And she said, you go and you have a good time, my child, but remember one thing when the clock strikes midnight, you must already have returned from the ball. So Cinderella promised to do that. She went to the ball.The prince fell madly in love with her and she with him. And they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock struck twelve. So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could, and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step. That was the only thing that the prince had to identify her with. Shortly after that, the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman he had no idea who she was.The only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper. So he sent a courtier round to all the families that had been invited to the ball with his little glass slipper and said, anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her. And of course, the courtier arrived at Cinderella's house and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet in the slipper. And of course, couldn't do that until Cinderella said, I would like to try. And she did.And of course the slipper fit, and the prince was delighted to have found her again."

And my husband was working for an international company that had its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. And they were looking to expand their work in John's particular area of expertise as far as marketing goes in Europe. And so they asked him and another guy who has similar job to his in the company to interview, to have a job over there.So turned out that they preferred John of the two, and so they asked him to move over to Switzerland. We were kind of obviously but we knew that we were going to have to leave our beautiful place in Vermont. I mean, Vermont, we lived there for 20 years and we loved it very much, but we knew we were going to have to leave eventually because this job was just going to take him somewhere else. So we thought, well, why not go to Europe? And so we decided to.He went over a year before I did and found us a place and did all the stuff that you have to do to get used to living in another country all by himself, which bravo him. And then I went over and joined him after our daughter got married in June of 99, we lived in a little village outside of Zurich. And it was an adorable little village. The funny thing was we lived in a very modern little apartment complex, maybe, oh, I don't know, 20 or 25 apartments in it, two levels, maybe not even that many, but anyway and everything else in the village was lovely and charming and old. And we did a lot of now that I think about it, when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of travel in Switzerland and walking around our village because Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl.So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms, and then they have walking paths everywhere because the Swiss love to walk. And so we could walk, like, to the next village and basically go and buy the fields, or we could walk through the woods. And they had passed going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company, meanwhile, bought a French scale company john worked for weighing in his case, it was weighing heavy duty, like trucks and railroad cars.And they bought a scale company in France. And so we were asked to move to France, which was like throwing me into the breyer patch because I was a French teacher. And so this was like the dream of a lifetime, actually. And so in Zurich they Speak German which was okay, that was kind of fun, too. But I had taken little German.My family is German. My dad, my grandfather spoke german as a child."

Had the reservoir on the side and the warming ovens at the top. And we had what we call the stovewood box.We had a big box that our stovewood that we burned in. This cook stove was placed in. And I can remember Mother sitting on this box of wood and telling me that I was not their daughter. And I knew my actual father and all my brothers and sisters, but I thought he was my uncle, and I thought they were my cousins. And I knew their mother was dead, but I didn't know she was my mother.She had died when I was two weeks old from childbirth. And I was the baby of eight children. And the man and woman that took me, she was my birth father's sister and her husband. But first, another family had taken me because I weighed like less than three pounds, and they just kind of put me off in a room because my mother was really bad sick and they didn't think I was going to live. So another family had said they would take me.One of her brothers, one of my birth mother's brother and his wife. And I remember Mother telling me that when she and Daddy went up to check on Zalma, which was my mother's name, that they asked about the baby, and they said, oh, she's in the other room. She'll never make it. She's a little bitty thing.They saw about me while I was there, and they told them and said she needs a doctor and they had to go ahead and leave. And about a week later, my mother was still real sick. But my uncle, which would have been my uncle, he and his wife had taken me on to their home. And about a week after that, my mother died. And the lady and her husband that actually ended up raising me, the other uncle had called them and said, we can't take care of this child.She needs medical help. We don't have the money. We have a baby. Would you all come and get her? So they came and got me.And fortunately, they lived next door to a doctor. And Mother and Daddy were they weren't rich, but they were well off in many ways, not just monetarily. And the doctor lived next door to them. And Mother had help in the house. She and Eva McDaniel carried me on a pillow for six months until I actually was beginning to weigh about five or six pounds.And this doctor that lived next door, Dr. Price mother said that he took very good care of me. I was born without a lining in my stomach.I had some bones back here in the back of my neck that weren't very well developed, grew up in this fairly fashionable lifestyle, and I went to school under the name Meese until I was about eight, even though my maiden name really was Yancey."

When we got back, we had way too much food and lose. But I probably went to sleep at one and then woke up at about five and went up to the top of the boat. The cabins are down below and the two holes, and then there's this like dining room, cabin area and the big outside area. And then you will go up this spiral staircase up to the very top where the wheel is and the controls for the sails, although there wasn't much wind and we were crossing the we were going to cross the Gulf Stream, so we were just motoring across.It wasn't good night for Seong, but I got up there and the two people that were there left and went to sleep. And the other person, who was supposed to be two people on shift, the other person never woke up. So I was just up there just motoring across the Gulf Stream. So the current was coming from one way and the wave wasn't much waves or wind really, but it was a full moon and so the full moon was setting in the direction we're going because we're going east to west and full moon was just slowly setting into the water and gradually there started to be land showing. So the moon was setting and then the sun started coming up.And when the sun came up, it only lit up the tops of the buildings along that whole miles and miles of development on Fort Lauderdale area. So because of the curvature of the earth, the tops of the buildings were popping up, slowly popping up, being lit up by the golden light of the morning sun. And we're still 20 miles away. And the buildings were getting bigger, they were getting more of them. And pretty soon you could see that everything you could see on the shore was buildings.And I thought I was looking around for commercial shipping and things like that, but I suddenly heard this noise, like a horn. What is this? And I'm looking around and then right next to us was a two hole inflatable craft with three big outboard engines on the back and a small cabin and several armed men in uniform. And it was the Coast Guard and they asked me to stop and permission to board or I don't know if it was permission exactly. Sure, stop the boat.And of course there's no brakes or anything, but I stopped the boat. They came on board and looking up at me and starting asking questions, which I was answering. And then by this time people heard and were getting up. So people were starting to show up on deck and starts asking for the captain, captain Robbie with his dreadlocks and everything and asking about our Itinerary and what our plans were and wants everybody's passports. And then one of the coast guide guys just starts looking around on the boat and just, like, opening hatches, looking around and looking into one cabin where somebody hadn't come out yet.Walking in places, just looking around, just making sure we're not smuggling large amounts of anything."

She had two daughters of her own that were about the same age as Cinderella, and she treated Cinderella like the maid instead of like a daughter, and treated her daughters like princesses because that's what she wanted them to become.Cinderella was a little more pretty on the inside and the outside than the sisters. And she had a very good heart and she just did the things she was supposed to do and tried to keep herself happy. And she found out that there was an announcement being made by this guru, by the king that the prince was going to be hosting a ball with hopes to find his future bride. And when the mother read it, the girls were all excited and started getting their dresses together. And Cinderella helped get their dresses together, helped them get together, and quietly she made her own dress and she got dressed for the ball to go to the ball that day.And the stepmother said, oh no, you're not going. You have to stay home and clean the house and get things together and no one will run to anyways. So then the stepsisters left for the ball and relo into her room and was crying. And her fairy godmother showed up and helped her create a new dress. And a pumpkin turned into a coach to take her to the ball.And the mice and the different animals were either horses or the sports coach driver. And the fairy godmother made Cinderella a pair of glass slipper shoes to wear to the so Cinderella secretly went to the ball without anybody knowing. And she showed up at the ball and came down the steps and the prince saw her and was enchanted by her and they danced. The one rule for the step, the one rule that the fairy godmother told her was everything will turn back into what it was originally at the stroke of midnight. So to make sure that she was home by the stroke of midnight.So she was at the dance, she was at the ball dancing and she heard the chimes and ran out, leaving the prince standing there. And the prince chased after her, but he couldn't catch her. And as she was running, she lost one of the glass slippers. She got back to the coach and Lynn was on her way home, was almost there, and everything turned back into what it was originally. So then the prince found the slipper on the step and he insisted that his royal staff help him find woman that it belonged to, because he knew that was the woman for him.They did a search, they went to all the houses and tried it on all the girls and they tried it on the two stepsisters. It didn't fit them. And then they said, well, that was the last house and then the one person then the prince saw Cinderella standing behind in the background that we hadn't tried it on her.

So the little boy waves to her and says, no, he doesn't need it. So he proceeds going to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain and he's going to get all wet.So he turns around and goes back home to his mother. So then his mother gives him the umbrella and goes back to school.Okay. This story is about Cinderella. It was about a young girl that was a cleaning lady. And she goes over to this big house where this lady has a couple of daughters that are very wealthy. So they have this young girl that is about their age.And she just cleans around the house and helps them to keep that big house clean. So one day they received a letter. It was an invitation to a big celebration where they were going to have dancing and I guess at a prince house. So she was reading it out loud when Cinderella was in the room and was excited for them because they were going to this big ball. And her being young, she wished that she could go to something like that.But she knew that she could never attend to anything like that. And the girls were all excited. They were getting ready. They were preparing for the big and so they ended up having their dresses made. And the day, it was getting closer and closer.So Cinderella was upset because it was getting closer. For that time.

And who is it?The ferry popped out of nowhere and told her that she could go, that she couldn't make it possible for her. And she just like couldn't believe this. And she had little mice friends that were consoling her, trying to calm her down because she was upset. And she's got this look on her face like it's unbelievable.

        "transcript": "Okay, so the story of Cinderella is it's a young girl or a young woman who lives with her dad, and her mom is dead, and he meets a woman, and she has two daughters. Her husband is dead, and he brings this woman and her daughters over to meet Cinderella. And he's madly in love with the woman. And I think they get married, and I think he quickly, sadly dies. So Cinderella is now left in the home with her stepmother and her two stepsisters, who really were never so great to her anyway.But now that her dad is gone, she is treated very terribly, and she's no longer really a family member. She's treated like the maid, the slave, and they call her Cinderella because they make her clean out the chimney, and she has dirt that look like cinders on her face. So anyway, in this land where they live, there's a kingdom with a king and a prince. And they make the castle, makes a declaration they're going to have a ball. And all the young women in the land are invited to come meet the eligible prince.And the stepsisters are very excited. And Cinderella is excited because she's not married as well. And then she quickly finds out from her stepsisters and her stepmother that there is absolutely no way that she is going. She's just not worthy of going. Plus, I think the stepsisters really could always tell she was much more beautiful than they were, and they didn't want the competition at the ball.So the night of the ball comes, and they lock her in somewhere. I think the old story was they locked her in somewhere and off they went. And she is crying or sitting there so sad, and what a horrible life. And her father and she had such a great life, and she's been terrible since he died. And her fairy godmother appears, and she shares all that has happened and not happening with the fairy godmother.And the fairy godmother says, cinderella, you're going to go to the ball. And she gets the help of the mice, and she does all sorts of bipity boom magic on little Cinderella. And her hair is done, her makeup, her jewelry, a beautiful gown. And she takes a pumpkin from the outside, and she makes that a beautiful chariot. And the little mice are bitterly BOP boomed, and they're turned into horsemen.And she's just about to leave, and she says, have a wonderful time. You look beautiful. However, all this magic and the spell will expire at midnight. You must get home by midnight. Cinderella says certainly.Off they all go in this beautiful chariot. To the ball she goes. She is by far the most beautiful woman in the room. And the prince finally asks her to dance. And then they continue dancing throughout the evening, and they're enjoying each other's conversation.And all of a sudden, she sees and then starts hearing the clock, which is about to strike midnight. And she says, I have to go. He says no. She says yes. And as she's rushing out of the ball and down the palace steps, she loses a slipper.She gets in, just barely gets into that chariot and out of the sight of the palace, poof back into a pumpkin. She walks the rest of the way home with the mice, and she gets home in time before the stepsisters, who then arrive home and they share with their mom and Cinderella what a wonderful time they had. But they do kind of sort of make reference that the prince did spend most of his time dancing with one beautiful woman. So next day or two, it comes out that that woman that monopolized the prince lost her glass slipper when she was leaving. And he had."

And he went into the service and stayed two years, came back out before he was 19, while he's still 18. But they gave him because his ship was leaving out, they gave him discharge it and the two years at that time, you had to join two years.He was in the atomic test when the bomb was let off and he was in there and was a Coccyn on a ship. And he took the sailors to the Bikini, where they had taken them off of that island because of the radiation that would be happening. And he took them over there, and many a time he's pulled them out of the water where they were drinking and back on. Well, he developed cancer, and when he got back to the shore, his ship had a 200 and some foot slash on it, I think it was. Well, they took all the men, the sailors, and let them go off in California for R and R.So they came on with Geiger counters, and the Geiger counters went on that ship, and it went out of all the way out. You couldn't even take the radiation amount that was on the ship that they were on. Well, they went out and gathered all of those men up and took them back onto the ship. And the captain was taken off and taken somewhere else. They never saw him again.Well, when my husband came home, he had radiation sickness, which they told him was ulcers. And he was doctor for it for I don't know how many years. And then he developed cancer from that. And he had his lung removed. And when he had it removed in the hospital, they were going to teach me how to ear irrigate him.He had to be irrigated because they had done well, I'm getting a little ahead of myself. First they taught me how to irrigate it, and he was in the room, and they showed me how to do it. And we went home on Christmas Eve, and he was so sick he didn't even know where he was at, really. And so the woman had he developed they developed a staph infection into his lung cavity when they're doing the surgery. And so he had to go back to the hospital.And then when they were teaching me how to they did the constant irrigation and killed all the red cells in his lung cavity. This has been a long time, so he's been dead 17 years now. But I can live it over. But I get the times. There's so much that happened.It's hard to remember exactly how it happened because it happened so many times. But they did the constant irrigation and killed all of those cells. And there was nothing in there. It's like a stone wall. And so they put over $10,000 worth of medication into his lung cavity to kill that.Well. When we went home on Christmas Eve, he was bacteria free, but they taught me how to irrigate it. And there was a container sitting there. And I said, I've never done this before. Never watched them do it.So she said, I'm going to show you how. She said, I've never done it before either. I said, if you haven't done it before, do you know what to do? And she said, oh, I know what to do. So she showed me how to irrigate it and how to take care of it.And so when we got through, there was another container sitting there. I said now. What's this?"

        "transcript": "Well, for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me, cinderella ends up being a maid, working for this family. And it was a mother and her two daughters. They were just very shrill and very unattractive young women. Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just very nice. These two were very spoiled and didn't have any appreciation for mean.Cinderella was so nice. Even the know animals loved her. The horse. Whoever was out there. Mice even.She was a delight. Anyway, there's an announcement comes to the Unattractive. Mother and daughters was delivered to their McMansion, I guess, where they lived. They weren't in the castle. They got an invitation to a ball.The prince was going to give a ball, and Cinderella used to she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance. And so when News came of this ball, she was also silently very excited about it. But the two know. Of course they were going. They had an invitation.And somehow I forget some of the details in between. But there was a fairy godmother who ends know, helping working some magic. And Cinderella does go to the ball like a pumpkin gets turned into a carriage. And with horses. And she's got a beautiful gown on, and she just looks really just beautiful.And the prince, of course, sees her right away and one of those across a crowded room and they danced all night and it was very romantic. And you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters, whoever they were. Was that the stepsisters or was that another story? The Wicked Stepsisters? I don't know anyhow.Those horrible faces. So anyway, the one caveat was that Cinderella had to be home by midnight. And you see the clock is striking twelve and she's saying goodbye to the prince. Of course he doesn't want her to let her leave. And she's late.She's running down this large flight of stairs and loses a shoe. One of her glass slippers. And the butler or whoever major Domo from the palace was sent around to the town to find who fits into the shoe. And Cinderella gets locked up. That horrible mother thought that they'd crammed the shoe on one of her daughters feet.And I remember their feet were ugly, too.And the mice end up getting she was locked in this room. They didn't want her on the scene. And the mice brought her the key. She got out and tried on the shoe. Of course it fit perfectly.She married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after. One Hopes. And I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at that wedding. Those are horrible people.All right, so let's move on to something a little bit different. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. Now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here. Otherwise it's an open face.They don't call it a sandwich. Right. So be nice. We'll pretend we have two pieces of bread and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread. Then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread."

She decided not to eat and one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge, massive breakfast because she used to love to eat and we had to tell her no jeans, decided she's not eating today. So there's all kinds of stories about it. Well, there was this little girl named Cinderella who was like really cute little girl.And but unfortunately her mother, something nasty happened to her. I think she went to the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years. And so Cinderella had to go move in with her evil stepmother. And her evil stepmother had two other daughters. And the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didn't like Cinderella.So Cinderella and this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house. She's got to clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun. Anyways, the mom and the stepgirls, they're kind of reading the mail and they get an invitation to the ball where the prince is going to be there. The prince is like this totally hot dude where Cinderella just has totally got the hots for this guy. It's like he is like on television all the time and she knows what he looks like and really wants to dance with him and stuff.But the evil stepmother says, no, you're not getting a dress. It's like you're a cleaning girl and you stay home and clean the attic and stuff. Well, me and your stepsisters were going to go to the ball. So they go shopping and they get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelry and new shoes and everything. And they go out, get ready to go to the ball.Meanwhile, poor Cinderella, she's up in the attic and she's crying while they're all going away. And she's kind of just wish I could go to the mall or to the ball. And all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears. And Brunhilda, the fairy godmother says, what's the deal, Cinderella? What are you so upset about?And Cinderella says, I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy and I like to dance and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff. But that evil stepmother, mine won't let me go. So anyways, the fairy godmother gets out the wand and touches Cinderella and all of a sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking. And then they go out in the garden and they dig up a pumpkin. And she kind of does the pumpkin and turns the pumpkin into a carriage.And then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horse that pulls the carriage because you have to pull up the castle in a carriage or they won't let you into the ball. So anyways, she gets into the pumpkin, and the fair godmother even put some air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin. And they went to the ball and they got to the castle and they were able to sneak in. And she's kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies. And the fairy godmother, the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters, they're kind of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her.And even when they see her, they don't even think it's her because she's so pretty. Anyways, the prince comes in and they have the dance, and they're all dancing around, and he sees Cinderella kind of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says, I don't know who you are. Who are you? She says, Well, I'm Cinderella. And he says, well, would you like to dance?And she says, Well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure I know how to dance, but I'd love to try. But she doesn't really know that the stepmother or the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes so anyone in the shoes can dance like magic. And on top of that, the shoes will only fit Cinderella."

In the time that this story originated, it was not a good position to be in because adults didn't have good attitudes toward stepchildren and people who might interfere with the flow of money in and out of family. So there was to be a dance at the castle where the prince was, and the two sisters, older than Cinderella and their mother, received an invitation to the dance and were quite put up with themselves, will with will. So anyway, they're looking over their wardrobes, trying to find out what they should wear, and Cinderella doesn't have much in the way of clothing. It's pretty sad.She's decorated with ashes and such from working in the kitchen, because in the kitchen in those days, you used ashes or scouring powder and it clung to you. Didn't come off your hands very well. Anyway, they all were interested in the dance, and so the two stepsisters were so enchanted with their possibility of cornering the prince that they continued to snipe at Cinderella. But they were so busy choosing what they were going to wear and that she only had to do twice as much as usual in order to help them get ready for the dance. So sisters were dressed all up, and Mama acquired a coach from somebody to take the girls, and she led the way out.And they were really overdressed. It was pretty sad, but you couldn't tell them that they didn't look as great as they thought they did, but they didn't.And once they got out of the house, then Cinderella dried her tears and her fairy godmother appeared on the scene, and they had used what they had on hands."

We went on a horse and buggy ride in a visa vis carriage. Our kids were in the back of the carriage facing forward.We were in the front of the carriage facing back.The carriage started going up a hill.The horse was balking.I without really thinking and moving as quickly as I could, I picked up the kids and got them off the carriage and suggested to my wife that we dive off the carriage, which I did, onto the ground, and she tried to step down and got her foot caught and was dragged. I hit my head and dislocated both knees. Was unconscious for a few minutes when the kids were hovering around me telling me that mommy was dead, and I told them I told the kids to go for help since the driver of the carriage was attending to the horse and not to the passengers. The kids ran for help, and I tried to get my legs back together.My wife was flown to roanoke hospital.I drove with the kids to the hospital, where I was treated for dislocated for dislocated knees, and my daughter was treated for a head injury. My son was treated for mild pneumothorax, and it was and we had to stay there for weeks while my wife recovered. And all in all, it was a nightmare.Okay. At first I would be short and curt with people and not work with them to communicate. I wouldn't be very empathetic. But having lived through this, I realize the problems in communicating, and I notice that a lot of people who have difficulty communicating are aware of their difficulty communicating, which makes them extremely anxious and makes the situation worse. So I tried to put them at ease, saying."

The thing that I felt the most was extreme weakness. It just kind of knocked me down, sapped all my strength.And it took a long time for me to recover. Back in those days, they kept us in hospitals forever. And I was there 15 days. On the 10th day I actually haemorrhaged, but other than that, I can't remember too awful much about it. Like I said, I didn't have terrible pain, some discomfort at first, and then it was just a matter of lying there in the bed recuperating, and I wasn't allowed to get up to go to the bathroom because I had a catheter for at least the first ten days and that wasn't the nicest thing in the world.But I managed and they kind of pampered me, so it wasn't too bad. It's present. Okay, so we're ready to start. Well, unfortunately my husband has Parkinsonian syndrome, and it has affected his speech so that he doesn't always pronounce distinctly. And the worst thing is the volume of his voice has just faded away and it's difficult to hear him.And so if I have to ask him to repeat it, sometimes he gets irritated about that, but he can do a little better. If I ask him to try a little harder, then it's better. It's more distinct thing that I recall, I was extremely frightened when my 13 year old son ran a huge hook into his hand and had to be rushed into emergency. And then it was so painful for him to have this big hook. I took him to the hospital with a hook in his hand because we were afraid to pull it out, we might do further damage.And so he was sent to the hand group at Jewish Hospital and they had to open his hand and remove it because this hook had left a rusty path. But it was very fortunate that it sort of pushed everything out of the way as it entered his hand because otherwise they were afraid that he was going to have bone and tendon damage. But he healed fine and there were no bad side effects from it. There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water and the current is very rapid and she's extremely frightened. But someone else, maybe she was whitewater rafting because this other person has on a life preserver and he is trying to save her.He is holding on to a tree, and I imagine that she is farther down. I can't see her hands, but they're both hanging on for dear life. And I'm sure he's there to try to help her.Johnny plays soccer with the school team, and so he's out on his front lawn practicing one day, kicking the soccer ball around and oops. Unfortunately, it hits the window and smashes through, going into the house where his daddy is sitting. And the ball knocks the lamp over and the daddy is registering shock."

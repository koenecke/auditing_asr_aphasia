        "transcript": " let me talk about when i went to belgium as a cultural exchange student which was i would say kind of life-changing when i graduated from undergraduate school i went to bowen green state university in ohio i'm from ohio and i had the opportunity to travel as part of the international foreign youth exchange which is a4 associated organization i was big in in 4h when i was young because i grew up in ohio so grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing but anyway i had the opportunity ohio the state of ohio since uh several people every year to go to a foreign country and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others and it's a really nice opportunity we had people stay with us when i was growing up so i always knew that i wanted to do that and since i had taken french all through high school i thought i will go to a french speaking country and france wasn't available but belgium was so i chose belgium and luckily i got to go there i soon found out that learning high school french was not what they were speaking in belgium so it took a lot longer to be able to communicate but it was really interesting and that i kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that i was placed in i was in several different families while i was there i was there for six months most of them didn't speak any so i had to learn french and that's the best way to learn it i think but it it was i when i say it was life changing it really kind of made me think about first of all that other people are not like us and the united states and really got me thinking about how can i do what i do um as a speech pathologist in other countries so i immediately came home and interviewed with the department of defense because i wanted to be an international speech pathologist and they said well you got to get your master's degree back then you you didn't have to have your master's degree and in a lot of settings to work and so that's when i came to the university of south carolina to get my masters and met my husband got married had children that kind of thing but it's always been something i had a private practice uh when i was teaching as a full-time professor and um did some a lot of international work that way so i was doing telepractice before it was cool and um got to work with people around the country i did accent modification and and that kind of thing so still a big interest of mine i still love to travel i still keep in touch with my some of my host families in belgium and we've hosted kids from other countries for for other programs as well so you now i think and always encouraged my children i hope they will get to um if not study abroad and uh travel a little bit more than i did growing up it just wasn't a big opportunity until i was like in college when i was able to do it now these pictures also tell a story take a look at them tell me a story with the beginning middle and end and again you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story so the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window his dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over on to his dad his dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face take a look at these pictures that tell a story um i'll ask you to tell me a story also with the beginning middle and end and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story so the little boy was getting ready to go to school when his mother said oh you definitely need to take your umbrella today"

        "transcript": " the bases are safe spots where they cannot be out if they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person they're out so that's another way that an out can be generated um let's see um the way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first second third and then touches back onto home plate that's one point or one run um i just mentioned that there's a field beyond on the diamond there's usually a fence behind that those those players that are in the outfield it's called the outfield um if the batter hits the ball over that outer fence then it's a home run and so he gets a free unimpeded trip around from each base and that's a point if the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base that person comes all the way around and he scores a point and then the batters gets a point so it's a two run home run so you um you try to get more points or runs before you are all of your 27 outs are exhausted um if you are tie if both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning then it's a kind of a sudden death like whoever gets the most runs where both teams equally have a chance to score runs um after that um they win the game so if you if you're tied in the ninth and then the visiting team comes up first cuz they start the the game they start batting they score a run they get then they get three outs the other team doesn't score they get their chance they get three outs with no runs then the visiting team has won the game there's no time the the games can conceivably last forever um the the the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points um some of the strategies that people and employ are um you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball and there's different types of pitchers there's some people that can throw really fast there's some people that not throw as fast but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow um and then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly so because if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm can throw the ball the first base and before that batter gets there then they're they're they're valuable um for the offensive team um some skills that you want is you want someone that is strong that has really good hand-ye coordination and uh that that can hit the ball far and hard um some specialized players are there they're skilled at speed so if you have some that is marginal hitting but he's fast um and they can hit the ball and but they're fast to first space and can get there before the other team is um is able to get the ball then that's um that's a valuable valuable position as well that's basically the just to the camera"

They finally got me in there.I could actually talk or anything like that, but I had to remember how to remember everything and room everything has gone back. I mean, everything about ABC, all that kind of stuff like that. Everybody's name, everybody, the computer on there, the coke sitting there, everything the wrong about it. You have nothing about it. You had to remember everything about it.So we went to I had like 30 days first that they brought in there, trying to get to see what I was doing, mostly to see what it was first. And then we went to after that. That's when we started to talk into getting the thing, make sure I don't forget something ten years before.But we did start like ABC one, two, three, or something like that. With my mom started to it's in Hooks. I went there, there was someone we got to talk over there and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all ABC, one, two, three, and stuff like that. It took a long time, it was about a year to start over that. And I've gone down.It was Monday to Friday. Now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks. Just try to talk a little better on that because I mean, at this time I could talk a little better, but it's just hard to get back everything out of there. So that helped different things about it for those six weeks, how you're trying to computer, trying to try to write on there, trying to do something about it.Got a little better there. And that's how they tried to after that they started IU and that's when they started with noun, verb, preposition, all those kind of things like that. There's so much you couldn't remember anything about it.But you just take your time trying to me and my mom helps with me all the time. Still trying to rewrite everything. Still I can't but if you had to rewrite things about it after you do that, you do very good about those things. But then you forgot about the other thing you did back. So it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time.So you just got to keep everything keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk. Mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much, people have no idea what I'm doing and they talk to me real quick. This is kind of weird because if one person talk to me, kills me. If there's three people, I can understand other people, I can understand what it is.So it takes time, how I'm getting around everything.It keeps going every year and still a cat. It's getting a little better. I don't know how long I can go, but it seems like I'm still doing something with it. And it keeps going over time. So I try to ride every day, all kinds of stuff like that.My mom's very helping in that. And my sisters have helped a little bit there, too. They need to do something like that.

They made her do the laundry. Obviously, in the story here, all the animals love Cinderella because they're all around whenever she hasn't apparently they like her a lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her things.So the king had a son. He was looking for a look for a bride for his son.Yeah, he was looking for a bride for his son. And they were going to have a ball so they could all come and see who she would pick, all the ladies, young ladies in the kingdom. And she was looking out the window in this one picture, she was looking out the window, kind of dreaming about it. But she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball. So Bell went to the ball and while they remember exactly how it was, but she ended up, I guess the fairy godmother came while she was while they were at the ball.And fairy godmother took daughter to come to the ball and had a carriage that she would take her to the ball in as a pumpkin carriage and take them to the ball. And I remember this one picture that it seems a little weird that horses were sitting on their hind legs kind of with their feet up something. They were standing there on four legs.That was kind of weird. And so the fairground mother took her to the ball and she got the ball and went in. And nobody knew this knew who it was because she was so beautiful. Nobody knew who she was. And they had the ball and the prince liked her.And then the times run off in the clock, big clock, big Ben or whatever.And Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home, back home before midnight, and it was after midnight, and so she got up, she ran out and her stepper fell off and she got home without supper. And then the prince started looking for whoever it was that had this slipper. And he was trying the slipper on everybody."

The next day, about one or two in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom, and I was struggling to get the covers off, was laying on my left side, so I trying to get covers off with the right, and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were. And that was my first sign. Something was wrong.At first I thought, because I had the two cats and I thought they were laying on the covers or something, but the room was dark, and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my mind, and finally they came off. And then I started to take some steps. The bathroom was the next room over, and I was finding that I was exhausted. And I decided I would just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed, but I just laid on the floor.I laid there for about 30 minutes. My garmin told me what was going on, the timeline. And so when I got back up, I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom. So I didn't just crawl back in the bed. And then about I was awake, asleep, back and forth till about 08:00.And I was trying to figure out something's wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major and I was trying to decide it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart. And I didn't want to go to the emergency room and there'd be nothing wrong. But I called a guy from work. I used my phone, and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number, so I want to leave him a voicemail message. And I was surprised to hear him answer, and that's when he told me, you called my cell number.So I worked for a very difficult company to work for, and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on, so I kind of jokingly told them something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day. And I said, Pass the word on my brain is not working right today. I won't be in. And so he just chuckled and said, well, okay, I'll pass that on. And then I called a friend and told him what was going on.And then between two of us, we decided, well, my idea, I will call him in a half hour. If you don't hear from me, call me. If you can't reach me, call for help. So half hour later, I called him, and I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did my neighbor next door came and got me and we went to the hospital.I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one. We got four hospitals to choose from, so I don't know why or remember why we went to that one, but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago."

But for the first months after the stroke, I worked hard at it trying to pull those pictures back. And I found that it's like learning in school again, grade school, you look at a word and you learn that word, and, oh, that's that word, and it comes back, and it stays back with aphasia.It doesn't stay there. It's more like having an electronic dictionary that occasionally gets scrambled. It's like, okay, I know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be. It's over there instead, that type of thing. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life to be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently, happy?I think when my grandson was born, he was a joy to be with, and I got to spend a lot of time with him when he was little as an infant, and watching him grow, and that was special. He's ten now, and he doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as I liked then, and he's off doing other things. Here are some more pictures that also tell a story. Take a second to look at them, and then whenever you are ready, tell me the story that you see with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay.Now, first of all, these pictures are under the last four stories, so I can't see what's there. There are two ways to fix that. We can click and drag our windows, or you can minimize it. All right, got it. All right, let's do this.There we go. Down below it now. Okay, boys, out kicking a soccer ball. He kicked it, got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad, but window came through the yard, and I'd say his dad saw it opened, looked out the window, and noticed who had kicked the ball.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at all of them, and whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see. It's a beginning, a middle, and an end.

But then the aunt was very nice. She made her pretty bad she had to go work outside and everything else and she's certain that dirt and all that stuff but her cousins were very nice they got to do whatever they wanted. They're kind of in the butt.So that's how it was for all the time. She tried to be nice, but they were still not very nice. But the one time they were going to have I guess they do for sometime the year, they get to see everybody. So they went to see if this would be see their their aunt took the two girls to make sure they were going to find one of the boy. The great boy is one of those that comes there.So they're going to go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that. But their cousin didn't know she was supposed to be there. But a what would you say?Not a ghost or something, I don't know but they had one that would bring on the way that's not normal how the people in Stoican it was totally different how they flew in here got them but they got a hold her and got her some different clothes in Stoican so she could go in that way. So she got to go in that place and went to see there that night got up, she could go sing and play or was out there, got some people and that's where they saw the big I think he's I don't know if he is the king or he might be just the new king coming there. He was with her for a while but then she had to leave and he was worried what happened to her but she left and he was worried about that but she did drop one of her shoes so he had that.

And there's some bushes outside the window.And the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp, knocks the lamp off knocks the lamp off the table but knocks the lamp over and so knocks the lamp over and comes through the window.The guy is sitting there probably watching TV or something but he gets up, picks up the soccer ball, walks over to the window and you know, the the window I think we talked about this last time.

It stopped, and there wasn't really much damage.So Dr. Miffards then said, we can fix that pretty easily. We'll take you and put you in hospital. Take four or five days. I have to cut into your skull and go in there, and we'll take that fix that will actually seal it off, and then you'll be as good as new.Everything will be okay, and you'll be in the hospital for five days, and then you go home, and everything will be fine.So I went home from that appointment, feeling very good, Karen.

I wouldn't be home for another six months. And in the meantime excuse the French fan. And it did big time.I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you. Okay. So that was my second stroke and did well.

Went to the emergency room and they discovered that I'd had a stroke.And so they put me in the hospital. And I was there three days, basically, my heart was out of rhythm and beating too fast and lots of different things. So they spent three days basically just dealing with that heart issue, getting it stabilized, and then three more days basically discovering that I'd had a stroke and aphasia. And then I went home after the trying to think what day of the week it was. Wednesday.Wednesday I went home, and Thursday I drove back to the drove van, because I could drive, I could do everything I needed to do except talk. So I went to make an appointment with the speech therapy at that point, and that's where it started. Do you mind telling me a little bit about that? Like your recovery? So what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke?Well, it started out with something simple, because basically I could look at anything, know what it was, but I couldn't pull the words out. And so we started with the simple things, like in the room, for example, looking around the room, looking at each object in the room, naming it, trying to find the word and say the word out loud. So that's where it first started, and it built from there. And some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago, like with pictures, look at the picture, name the picture. And over time, that gradually got better and better.But that's where I think the start with the therapy was. And then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing, taking a paper and pencil and writing, I couldn't spell properly anymore. And that was something that I had to work at. So I found that with my keyboard, I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with notebook.Here the same thing. It has a spell checker and a spell I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker, but it starts out if you start the first few characters of a word, it gives you several different words that work. So that sometimes helped a lot as well, writing. So I've done a lot of."

Took a couple of aspirin, I went to outside and picked up the mail not the mail, but my newspaper, went back to have breakfast, and as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast, I tried to read, but I could not make it, read the paper properly.

I think that's probably the best thing I could say about that.I didn't know how to log in. I didn't know my username, I didn't know my password, anything, and I just had a total blank with that. So I worked at it for a while and couldn't do anything. So I finally went to my boss and said, hey, I've got a problem. I've got a headache, and I just can't log in.And I was asked, Just take time and find a place to rest and relax and come back a little while and try again. So I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again, and I couldn't make it. So I finally said, I can't do it. I need to go home. So I went home, went to bed.When I got home, I took a couple more aspirin, went to bed and spent most of the day in bed, and I slept. And then when I got up in the afternoon, I was able to read.

But I did a lot of walking, I did a lot of exercise every morning other than weekends, they were doing something to me. Lot of exercise.Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently? Sure. Other from getting married.

Wonderful time. I played baseball, I played football, but football was my thing.I learned a lot, I got a lot from it and it was one of my best things.Glad to hear it.

        "transcript": "Okay, I can tell you about the first one. I'll tell you that one. The first one, I was home alone. Sharon had gone to get her haircut about 25 miles away, and I was working here at the house. I've been working on doing some carpenter work in the house, and I started to feel kind of numb in my right hand.I didn't feel too bad, but I knew from what people had told me, I'd heard many times, one of the signs of a stroke is numbness. In fact, I remember I was a fellow that I used to work with, had a stroke at work, and I remember going through that and kind of recognized from that how it looked. So I knew what was going on. I knew I was having a stroke against my well, I shouldn't have done it. But I called Sharon and I said, you probably need to come home.I'm going to go to the hospital. I don't feel right. I'm not sure what's going on, but just come on home. And I said, I'm going to head to the hospital. Just come on down to the emergency room when you get here.So I did. I went out and I got my truck, and I went to the hospital, which isn't very far away. It's six or eight blocks away from here. And I drove to the hospital and drove into the emergency room parking and walked into the hospital. And I said, I think I'm having a stroke.And they didn't waste any time, said, okay, somebody coming back. We're going to take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They took me, put me in one of the examination rooms, and they started to examine me. Sharon, it was about a half hour away, so she got there after this had started, questions. I think they already taken me to get a CT scan or whatever it was before she got there.So when she got there, I already had gone in to get a scan.When I was done with that, they took me back into the waiting, back into the room where I was, the treatment room, whatever you call it, in the emergency room. And I remember pretty well that Sharon was there. And I knew what was going on at that I had a stroke, but it felt like it wasn't getting any worse. It was just stroke, so I wasn't too worried about it."

And when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me, he says, you had a stroke. He says it wasn't a big one, but he says, you had a stroke. It so that's how I knew I had a stroke.It was really, really weird. But I forgot so many things. Like in the morning, every morning after I got my breakfast ready, I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper and I couldn't read it. I looked at it and I couldn't get the words. I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words.And what I did get to read, I didn't understand. So I tried for a couple of days and I thought, the heck with this. I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days I'm sitting there and I thought, you are going to learn to read that paper. I started reading it now.I read a paper and it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning when I got up, after I went to the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there and I'd think of my daughter's family. There's four people in the family. There's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name, but I couldn't get his name out.And the two boys and I would just close my eyes and visualize it. And gradually, all of a sudden, I'd see their names and gradually it would come. Then I went with my older son, with his family. It was tiring. And I did that at night too, when I went to bed, before I went to sleep.I worked with one family at a time. And then my sisters and my brother and all that. And it was a long time, but it worked. It really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day, I says, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me.I says, I am so tired. And I says, I don't do anything. She says, mom, you are doing a whole lot. I says, Such is what? I says, all I'm doing is thinking about this one and thinking about well, that's it.She says, you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it. But it all came. It's just now I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out and that and when I write, it's getting better. Sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything and all of a sudden I look at it and I thought, no, that's not that word. And the first time I saw that was when I was going to the store, my little shopping thing.I needed mayonnaise. I'm writing and writing I get to the store and I came to that word, I couldn't figure out what it was. It wasn't even making any kind of sense. And I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping, I would keep going back at it and back.Now I have to think what was I going to do with this? Then I knew what it was. It would come. I forget it again. But that's the way it goes.I know everything, but I forget a lot of things. But everybody."

        "transcript": "It something important that happened to me.My grandbabies ah, my daughter and I, we struggled a lot in her teen years, and but she met this guy when she was 13 or 14 years old in her school. And when I first met him, I'm just seeing this skinny teenager with acne, and I'm thinking he's just full of hormones. He's like, this is the last thing I want around my daughter. I got enough trouble with her anyway.They eventually got married, but she was determined. She didn't want any kids. She was just sure she would screw them up, and it's just too hard. And so me and my husband just see the world, and they did, they did a lot of traveling and everything.And I have a son, too, but he didn't seem to have any interest in getting married or having kids or anything. And so I just thought, you know, I may never have any grandbabies. I sure would love them, but if not, then okay. So I just worked in the church nursery and kind of helped get my baby fixed there. And then my son in law and daughter moved to Florida, and by this time, I realized through some different experiences that he loved her and was very protective of her.And I was always super protective of my kids, and I realized he was just as protective of her, if not more so than I ever was. And so I thought, he's going to cart her off to Florida, and I don't want her to be so far, but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for then I don't remember how long they'd been there, maybe a year or so. And she came back to town, and a relative on his side had a baby, and she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby. And I remember I took a picture of her with that baby, and I thought, she just looks so natural with that baby, like she's held them all her life.And she told me, I really want one now. And so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing babies, she lost two or three. And then when she had this one and maybe about six months in, I'm in Indiana, she's in Florida, and I'm nesting. I mean, my house is reasonably clean anyway, but I cleaned my whole living room once, and I just know it had been recently remodeled, and so there wasn't a lot of junk in there, but started pulling items out and going through them. And I cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows and just every crevice I cleaned in that living room."

The little cat, they all looked kind of, like nervous to me. They didn't look like they were the little girl was two little girls.They looked like they were dangerous people. And the cat looked like it was somebody that the cat was like a funny looking cat, too. On this side, there was like a little girl, and she was very nice looking. And I'm not sure who this guy is supposed to be. He's a man, and he's got like a beard, not a beard, but what to call that mustache or something.And he seems like a nice person. And he was inviting them to come into their house.I don't know exactly what I could say about this whole thing. If I was a little girl, I bet you I could remember all the details on this a lot better than I could.So then I think what you you get to see this this castle from the distance, and I think there's this young woman, and she looks like she works there. She probably works at somebody's house, and she probably had to like her job was to clean and she was trying to help out. She probably wasn't rich, but I think they were looking the major part of the story I think I'm going to continue with this is that they were looking for a young man, handsome man, who was going to get married.He was probably in the place again, I said it right, but now I've forgotten what to call it. The castle. They were going to have like a dance there with music, and they had this glass shoe that they found the right one that would fit, that would be his wife. So a lot of people came to the castle and they had the dance, doing dancing. And I think this young woman who was very good looking, she had to work there.Maybe it was the mother or something. But her two daughters, older daughters weren't very attractive, and they were probably hoping that they were going to be ones that would somebody this handsome man was going to marry her.So so mainly, I think they went to this I'm not calling it a dance."

Well, I got up in the morning and right away I rolled over and she was by my side. And I told her I felt a little queasy and she didn't see much about it. So then I went to the bathroom and I went to the bathroom and did my thing.And then right after I did my thing, something happened in here. And up I said, oh, no. And that's the last thing I remember for weeks.Do you remember your recovery? Do you mind telling me a little bit about the things that you did to get better after your stroke? Well, the last thing I knew before my stroke hit was after my stroke hit, I woke up and I remember this was Amsterdam, New York. So the next thing I know, I'm back in Wichita and I'm on a bed. My wife's there, and I slowly started talking to her.But at the first thing, I don't think I made much sense to her. But she was always there for me, so it was okay because I could tell her anything I wanted and she listened, did or whatever she could.And then after a while, two or three nurses would come in every day and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back. And every day it was something different. And I would go down the hall and they would do leg lifts trying to get me whatever. And I would do stairs. I remember that I did stairs.Did a lot of I don't know. I don't know. There was always somebody there, and there was always somebody doing something to me. A lot of it I don't know anymore.

About 01:00 or 130 in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom, and that's typical for me. And I had trouble getting the covers off. I was laying on my left side.I remember that because I had right side weakness, and the blankets just felt really heavy, and so I really had to work at it to lift the blankets. It was like they were full of bricks or something. And so I got them off when I just really focused on it. And then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom, the next room over, was too far for me to walk. I was exhausted.And so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed, and I laid there for about half an hour. And I think I kind of dozed off a little bit while I was down there. And then I got up and thought I'll try again, but as soon as I stood up, I realized, no, I'm still just too tired. So I crawled back in bed, and about 730 or 08:00, I decided to call a fella at work and tell him that I wouldn't be in. My boss was a creep, and so I avoided talking to him when all possible, but this guy was kind of the boss's pet, and so I'll just call him.And when I used my cell phone, I had that guy's cell phone number and desk number, but I thought, sure, I selected the desk number, because I was really not even wanting to talk to him either. But I thought I'll just leave him a message. Well, he answered the and so it had to be before 08:00, because I was really surprised. He answered the phone, and I said to him, brian, you're at work already? And he said, no, you called me on my cell phone.What's up? And I said, well, my brain is not working right today, so I'm not going to come in. And I chose those words carefully. I didn't want them to know there was a health issue, but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not coming in. And I certainly needed to make that call.He took it as a humorous and I was fine with that. That was kind of why I said it the way I did. And as a side note, when I came back to work, he recalled that conversation. He said, I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me. And I said no.Brian, I wasn't trying to tell you. Not this was not a call for help. I already had in my mind what I was going to do, but I just needed to let you guys know I wasn't going to be here. And so he was so relieved to hear that. And so I felt bad when he said that.I was like, oh, gosh, the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing. And anyway, so I called either before him or after him. My gentleman friend and I never call him. We've been going together for about six years."

So then I was just waiting probably for 2 hours and Deb finally said it was time to let the kids in and she said, no, this is not right.Something is wrong with Mary. I am going to go to her house and see what's going on. So she and another person, teacher Wendy, came to my house and I live now two blocks away from the school, and they knocked on the front door. And then Deb said, I am going to check the back door. And she saw my car still there and she said, all right, something is wrong.I am going to call the police and the fire men. And then the firemen, I have a window on my front porch and it was open. So the fireman walked through and opened the door and Deb came upstairs and found me naked on the floor. And I said, oh my God, thank you very much for finding me. And I went out and I heard the fireman say, get a sheet and cover her before we bring the stretch up.And I have a steep staircase to my second floor. So they were carrying me out to check me out at the hospital and I passed out and for three weeks I didn't know what was going on. And first they brought me to Salem Hospital and my sister in law is a nurse in the or. And she said, oh my God, it's Mary. And she said, Give them to me the X rays because I want doctor I don't know what his name is to look at them."

        "transcript": "I had a lot of speech therapy.I went to two different organizations for therapy because they would only work me in two times a week. So I wanted more therapy than that. And so I went to both. So for maybe about six or eight months, I got four days a week.Each session is about an hour.I also did some physical therapy, but I didn't stick with it. And so I can still feel like my right leg drag a little bit. And I also have trouble writing, so I have some occupational therapy I did as well, and it helped a little bit, but not a lot.But the speech therapy I found that some therapists I just connected with better than others. And the one I spent the most time with, I really liked her a lot. She was very good and very positive. And as she explained something important to me, she said in the beginning, she said, I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now. Then after we work together a while, I'll test you again to gauge where you're at.The therapist I had worked with before that never explained that to me. So when they would ask me these questions and quiz me, I was frustrated. I felt so stupid because I couldn't do them. But if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing, it would have made it so much better. But they didn't think to tell me that.But I did games on my phone. I went to local college that had meetings on Thursday evenings for 2 hours. And so the first hour, everybody's in the same room, and then the second hour we're split up into groups. And the leader is the one who decides what group we go into. So you go into a group with about four or five other people who are about your same level.I bought books, grade school books for math and reading and tracing letters and numbers. And I did that on my own and I did puzzle books. And then I went back to work. I went back to work very quickly, way before I really was able to do much. But I just thought, I've just got to get in there and do it.So I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke.I always liked to cook, but now I really kicked it up. I found about healthy eating and I've always liked junk food. And I decided to eat really healthy. I felt like that would help me recover and so got these cookbooks. And learning to understand measurements again was difficult at first, but I learned and I still struggle with it sometimes."

Have you ever heard the story of Cinderella? Yes. Do you remember much about it? I think so.These pictures might remind you of how it goes. Take a look at the pictures. And then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words.If I could remember what I said last time, it would be good right now. Tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at.There was there was a girl named Cinderella, and her father was getting remarried. And when he got remarried, he had two stepsisters. Two stepdaughters. And the step's mother didn't like Cinderella, and they made her do all of the housework and cooking of the food and whatever. And finally a ball came around, and all the stepdaughters were going to the ball, and Cinderella couldn't go because she had too much to do.And fairy godmother came to her and said you could go to the ball. And she made a beautiful dress for her. And she made a coach with a pumpkin, I think, and then say, take her to the ball. And she had beautiful time."

And they said I didn't have any sensation on the right side and I didn't have any vision on the right side either.And they said, you have to go to a hospital to recuperate. And that is when I went to Spalding and stayed there for nine weeks, recovering little by little. And I was walking with the help of Lauren, my physical therapist. And Kate was a godsend. She was working with me for my speech.That is all I cared about. Will my speech come back?So that when, in April, it was time for me to move on. And so I went to A step down facility called the Cheryl Health Jamaica Plain. And that is all of my therapist, Sherry, Sean and Andrea, they took very good care of me. And I had OT with Sean and PT with Sherry and speech every day with them. And it was good.And then I went home in August 1 and they fixed the house so that I could have a bedroom on the first floor. And we oh. Then I had the visiting nurses come in and for August up? No, just September, October and November, the first two weeks of November, I had physical therapy and speech and OT at my house. And then I went to see facilities that could do outpatient treatment.And I went to one in Malden and then one in MedFin, and it was balding MedFin. And so I chose that one to do my bulk of my recuperation at an outpatient basis. And I am on the road to recovery because when."

As part of the family, she was more of a servant.They grew up that way. And then over time, she got to know the animals in the home, horse and the dog and the mice and had more of friends with those than with the other two people.And then as she grew the family or the king in that neighbor neighborhood, city, whatever, had a son that was grown same time. And he decided Son needed to meet a girl his age and possibly don't know what the situation was there but anyway, he decided to create a ball to bring all the eligible girls in the kingdom in and meet them and decide who might be his girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you want to call it. And so they sent the invitation out. The stepmother saw it and planned on taking his daughters, but not Cinderella. Cinderella wanted to go as well.So she, with the help of the animals, made a build a dress for her, a gown, and showed it to her stepmother and the daughter or the sisters, and they ended up and damaged it for her so she couldn't wear."

They're out of control. They're into my computer, and they're going to mess up my work, and they're into my freezer, and I'm not going to be able to cook because they're messing with all this food and everything. He thought those little people, little videos, maybe two minutes long each, he thought those were hilarious. And he would watch them over and over and over and over again because that's what little kids do when they like a video they do 100 times.And then his baby brother came along and think of there so two years difference. Yeah, two years. And so the baby, he's just as cute as he can be. So he's right about almost two. And so much difference between the two and their personalities.But the first one, he's super smart. He's also very manipulative.He works that cuteness angle. And then the second one, he was a lot more agreeable. He was plenty smart, but I could tell not to the level his brother is. He didn't get stuck quite as quickly. It's like you had to work with him a while, but then you get in, he was fine.I think he just likes to analyze, maybe more, just to think things through. So the second one, just super long eyelashes any girl would love to have. And this is just as cute as he can be. And I went to go see them last Thanksgiving, I think it was, or Christmas. It was last Christmas.I went to go see them Christmas, and I FaceTime with them a lot. And so the older one, he's thrilled to see me, and he just runs to me and says, granny wants me to pick him up and everything. But the baby, even though he'd seen my face a lot on the screen. And of course, I'd seen him in person too, but not real often. It took him a minute.He had to watch his older brother, like, I guess it's okay to go sit near her. It was like it seemed like at some point a light switched on with him, and he was like, she's fine. So I've then had them both on my lap, and for about an hour or two, I was enjoying celebrity status. Just cool. I've always heard how much fun grandbabies are.Head.

The beginning is that the little kid, I think it's a boy, is going off to school. And mom tries to hand him an umbrella. And he says, mom, I don't need an umbrella.I'm a big kid. I don't need umbrella. It's not going to rain. I'll walk. I'll be okay.So he waves goodbye to the mom. He's got his backpack on, heads for school, tells mom goodbye, and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't want to take with him. So he starts walking off to school and there's some raindrops coming down. Not a lot, but just a few raindrops here and there. And he looks up the sky and he's like, oh, no, what did I do?I didn't bring the umbrella. So he said, I think I'll go home and get the umbrella. And he turns around and it's raining harder now. The wind's kind of blowing because the rain is coming at an angle. And it's quite a bit rain because as he runs, he's splashing, so there's enough rain that's making splices.And he's kind of holding his hand up over his head as though he's going to be able to stop the water off his head. But he runs home and you can say the mom is a little perturbed because he wouldn't take the umbrella. So there he is, all wet, head to toe, wet, dripping wet. And the mom just kind of looks at him like, you should listen to what I said. He said, okay, so give me the umbrella.So she gives him umbrella and he heads back to school. And it's still raining, still raining pretty hard, coming down at an angle, even more of an angle than it was. So it must be blowing pretty hard, about a 45 degree angle. And he's walking guys backpack and he's walking off to school. And it the moral of the story is listen to your mom.She knows best. The end."

He's like, I'm here on this ranch and I'm happy, so you all can worry about all you want, but I might come down. So the little girl says, daddy, daddy, daddy.And she's little girl is probably young and old. She's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle. She's got pigtails and little black sandals.Like I said, she's riding a tricycle. The cat won't come down. So apparently the dad must have gone up in the tree to get the cat down, and he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there and something happened. I'm going to guess maybe the dog that's barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something, but something hit the ladder and knocked it down. The dad stuck in the tree, and I don't know who called the fire department, unless he has cell phone.Maybe it's, maybe, I don't know. He must have cell phone. He called the fire department, and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters carrying their ladder, and they're running over to get the man down out of the tree. Meanwhile, the dog is barking up the tree.I don't think he's mad. He's just barking up the tree because he wants the guy to come down or something. So the firemen are on their way.

And I did not notice what was happening, but she saw me dropping my purse, and then she stayed behind, and she yelled to me, jenny, you dropped your purse.So I turned around, and again, I didn't notice anything. But when she saw me, she was like, oh, my God, something's really wrong. According to her, my face was already distorted.In retrospect, I realized that I was not able to speak because she tried to tell me, we need to go back. And I guess saying no, but that's all I was in. Okay, so eventually, let's see. All right. I started noticing things that were kind of out of whack.For example, at some point, I was really smiling on this side, and I felt the emotion of kind of, like, bursting out into laughing. But then on this side, then I was feeling, like, very sad, and I could feel the emotion, and it's like, what's going on? And then all of a sudden, I noticed that my eyes were deviated to the left, which, in retrospect, I know that when you have a brain lesion, the eyes deviate the left or to the right, depending where the lesion is. Anyway, so finally, they went ahead and took me to the hotel. Once again, eva.My partner went ahead and recruited some people that ushered me back to the hotel. And there was a medical conference there that I was taking. So it's a whole bunch of doctors there. So one doctor came out, and then he saw me. She's got a stroke and then proceeded to elevate my neck.And that was the most painful experience I have ever, ever had. And then we waited for the ambulance to get by I mean, to come in, and they did my bottles. The hospital was about five blocks away from where the stroke happened, and they were able to start TPA, which is TPA. Sorry, which is an anti clotting medicine.

So when my instructor said to me, I think you can do it, I said, Great. Let's do it. So I went to the registry, got into an office with a state trooper and he looks at me and he says, Mr.Flyn, where are you going? I says, Well, I'm hoping to get my license. He says, I think not. I says, why is that? Because you haven't filled up all that information.I says, yeah, I understand that, but I can't write. I can't communicate that way. He says, not my problem. That's your problem. I says, yeah, and I want to tell you one more thing too, by the way, you're a bastard.He said, what did you say? I says, Let me do that one more time for you. I was so upset about that. So state trooper looked at me and says, okay, Mr. Bowman, he's a smack.I want you to get in this car and let's see if you can really drive. I don't care about anything else. Let's see if you can drive. I said okay. I thought for sure I was going to have another stroke.But at the end of that test, this group looked at me and says, all right, Mr. Flint, you made it. But understand one thing you just barely made it. I says, I don't care. I made it.And then he said to me, which I thought was very special to me, he says, I want you to go with me to go to Spalding because you have that monthly meeting. Because I need to know for what it's like for other people to have strokes. Being your license getting a license is one thing. Being a plane is another thing. I says you're right.So I learned something.So I got my license. And driving now is I never hardly do it at night very much well, because I'm getting old in my eyes, stuff like that.

And so the Prince knew that she had been wearing the glass slippers, so they searched all around for the person who owned the slipper.

My grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage, and on the weekends, you went to the cottage, and we wouldn't go every weekend, but most of the time we did, especially with summertime, but not schools. We would take that time, and I think that was my favorite places to go.We could fish, we could swim. And it wasn't very deep. There was a lot. Now it was deep in the middle. But right now you didn't really have to swim.You could just walk around a little bit. There were frogs. There was turtles. So, I mean, we got up in the morning, and I think we ate as fast as we could to go outside, and I think you were pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed. And I remember all of those memories on the fact that all the fun things that we were able to do, like, my dad let me have a rowboat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the motor in the back.You were not allowed to go fast. It was like two five fast, so it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the boat. But they let me actually mow it like that. And for me, being old enough not to drive, I could use that paddle boat and stuff like that.I loved to drive. I just thought that was really cool. I'm not sure why now. It was such a big thing, but it was. And I was by myself on the boat.I thought it was something else and all that. We forgot the gas one time. We had to row back, stuff like that. When I was a kid, at night, we had a place to lay down outside, and we would go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty. I think if I have a bad night now, I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage.I still remember that kind of stuff. When I have bad nights to go to bed, I think about that place. I don't know why. Yeah."

Here, the two women who lived in the house were not very attractive and the prince was not much interested in them. But in time he discovered that Cinderella was really quite charming and delightful, and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit longer. But then came the stroke of midnight and she got back to her room and had a wonderful time. The prince there still had not found the perfect woman that he had adored.So several people started looking around to see them and to decide which one was really which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted. One after another, several of these terrible creatures proved that she could not fill fit he couldn't fit the portions, could not fit the let me try it again.All of the other women in the castle were not, were too big and could not be, could not be, could not, could not get the size of the shoe that they were trying to find. But the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly at that point. The prince then was brought to the castle and they were married immediately and lived happily ever after. Very nice.

        "transcript": "Yes, I think I mentioned to you last week possibly I didn't, but the time I spent time at the Rehab Hospital of Indiana as a volunteer four through seven and because I started four, which is 20 years after the 84 80 for injury. And it became rather troubling to me because because they just didn't do therapy for their brain injured in those years. So there is no therapy. You are able to survive, you're able to just get discharged, hospital, go home, because they just did not do therapy in those years. And over the course of the next 20 years, wife and I found out about from people that had had therapy brain injuries later, that the divorce rate amongst the brain injured approaches 90%, and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five times national average is what they're telling people even 15 years ago.And so I wanted to share that with patients at RHI just to give them hope that recovery is possible. But it just takes a long time. And in four, when I started there at RHI, I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families up a year to year and a half recovery, year to year and a half recovery, year to year, and after recovery, hey, you don't stop recovering. The rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty radically after a year to year and a half, but you never stopped recovering. In the 84 incident, I had a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip, and it was just something that I accepted, and it was like a function without it no big deal, but to stick a pin there wouldn't feel it, no big deal.And then it was probably, I believe, five years ago, I think it was 925 years after the 84 incident, I was in the in the bedroom putting on my socks one morning, and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for 25 years. So what I'm telling you, Ashley, is that the recovery may slow down, like I say, and mathematically describes asymptotic but still slow down significantly. It but still you never stop recovering. You just don't stop recovering. You don't.I'm done preaching."

So the little girl could have been actually seen the dog chasing the cat.But anyway, she sees the cat as up there and would like to have it come down. She was probably riding a tricycle, so probably her father put the ladder up on the limb limb, the limb, and went up there and the ladder fell. So it's pretty high up and the cat's up there and the man is way up high. He doesn't have a ladder. And by the looks of it, actually his daughter is more interested in a cat than her father.It's a man perhaps, and there's a bird in the tree also, but I don't think they're involved and I don't think they are frank the cat or anything like that. So the firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going to first take the father down and then they're going to get the cat and the little girl will be happy. And the dog who knows what's going to happen to the dog. It's going to probably chase after the cat again, find another tree."

They looked me over, they said, You've probably got a virus or something, because they took my blood pressure and all that. And I drove. I wasn't having trouble driving.I even remember I was sitting playing on my phone while I was waiting for them to take me in. And they gave me medication. I went home and laid down.

Really? Because it had been tough in his family life.So I found a way to get him to move in with me. We didn't have a lot of money to make it happen, so I found a way to get him here, and after he'd been here a few months, kept saying, I'm sick, I'm sick. They finally found out what it was, so it was just a tough approach.So his parents finally moved him back in, and it's just been a tough path the entire time. I've learned how not to talk much, so I haven't been able to participate in us in language at all, just in touchy feely stuff. But I stayed up there when he was in the hospital.

After three months, my physical health, I mean my physical health was fine, but of course the aphasia kicked in and so it took me probably about seven months to be able to be able to say the right words and that type of thing. So I've had a speech therapist ever since the hestro went back to work, things was slower. Unfortunately, I went back to doing anxiety and stress and then I recently had a seizure in November 25, two days after Thanksgiving. So now I'm getting ready to go on disability for a year for my job, so I can recover, continue, do speech, go to the therapy and the doctor.So it's not a bad thing because I can talk now before I went back from ABCs to one, two, three.

And then I spread it around until it is nice and sticky or it sticks to the bread. And then I wash my knife and then I open the jam and I put some GM on the other piece of bread.And then I take a spoon and put it on the bread nice and gently and I make it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Then I put the piece of bread with the peanut butter on top of the bread with the jam. And then I take a knife and slice it and then I can eat it because it is a good sandwich to have. At are."

And then I just want you to describe the pictures to me. They tell a story. So if you could tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.All right, so I guess the beginning. I see a child out in the yard playing with a soccer ball, and apparently while he's playing, he kicks it, and it goes through the window. And it goes through the window. I'm assuming it's in his well, I guess I'm assuming it's his home. There's a gentleman here that we'll just assume it's his father.So it goes through the window, the father sees that the ball probably actually hits him, and then he grabs the ball, and he looks out the window, and he's clearly, I'm assuming, not very happy that his window was broken by the ball. Wonderful. I know. Thankfully, that's never happened to me. Never did that to my mom.Yeah. Whether that's the parent or just the owner of the house, probably not very happy. I know. I don't know what I would be more scared of if it was my neighbor. Yeah.And I guess technically, from this, we can't tell who the person is. All right. And then here's another photo for the same thing. It tells a story with the beginning, a middle, and end. So just look at the photos.All right, what I'm guessing from this is the child is getting ready to leave for school from his home. Home. And I would say his mother is saying you should take an umbrella. And I'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella, and so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella. He gets partway to school, and it starts pouring.So I'm assuming he's unhappy that he's soaking wet and looks like."

And she says, I need somebody to write articles every single week for the newspaper. And so I did that for those two years and I mean, she was awesome. And I did find out a year ago that she's still alive. And I'm thinking, I'm going to try to find her this summer because with the stroke, this has been tremendous for me, me being in 7th grade, learning all of this.I can hear everything she's still telling me from the beginning.

I would always be with my dad and my mom, but they're divorced. But he was the light of my life. And so when he passed away, I just couldn't take it.It was just too much for me. And then I had my first stroke, and then I would start thinking, I wish you were here, because you would have seen what I was trying to accomplish. Now I can't, because he's not here. And I couldn't continue working because I used to work at a legal office and I used to have to read land leases or cell sites, and the words were very tiny, and I just couldn't read them, especially when I had my first stroke. Like I said, I couldn't even read.I still have trouble reading. So it was probably the worst times of my life. The happiest time is probably when my husband bought me a dog, a service dog. And he is the light of my life. He is great.I love him. He takes care of me, and I take care of him. He's a big German shepherd, and he's just mine."

And that would, of course, have been great, except her, like, mother died. And I guess a lot of those, like, Disney shows do that sometimes.The dad was a good man, but like, a lot of people, I guess, would eventually think that maybe he might want to try to meet someone else. And so that ends up happening and really messed up by marrying this other woman who ends up she's just so cruel and so selfish.Okay, what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life. And so what I mean now is that what is that called?The other woman, she now has the power, I guess, where she's really being awful with Cinderella and I guess maybe even her dad might have died. I don't remember about that. Anyway, so they would show in the story then, now, how Cinderella, her life has just totally changed. She went through a really nice life, which was deserving to her because she was a very wonderful person, very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone. So now that the other mother is now there, the other mother makes Cinderella do everything, all the washing and everything you can think of, cooking, I guess, cleaning, whatever you do.And those two sisters that's called those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very, like, very snotty, horrible, don't even care about Cinderella at all."

I loved the work, but the people were just insane and bullied people to get things done. And I got to blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over.But I was afraid to look for another job, because if that next job doesn't work out, because I left this job on my own, I wouldn't get much unemployment. So I was really afraid to move. And there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work. So I felt really trapped. But I was looking, but it was just there really wasn't a lot to pick from.And anyway, the day three months or so before they laid me off, I just had a feeling it was getting ready to happen. So I started collecting my information that I was going to need later. And I put my notes in a notebook and I took them out to my car. And then when I wanted to refer to them, I went out to my car and looked at them. I didn't keep them at my desk.I took everything out of my office except for things that belonged to the company. I saved off programs, I had written, everything. So then when the boss and the HR guy came to my office and told me I was real happy about it, I tried not to look so happy about it, but I was really happy. And then I was out of work for ten months, and it was okay because I had unemployment, I had money, savings, and I was doing all right with that. The great thing is also that I got a wonderful job, and now I work from home full time for a company that's in Minnesota.And so my boss, as I have now, is wonderful. He's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice person. And I still do the same kind of work I used to do, but now it's for nice people.That's wonderful. Here is another set of pictures. Take a little time to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay.This boy is kicking a soccer ball and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window. And it went in and knocked over the lamp. And the man saw the damage. As it happened. He got up with the ball in his hand and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story.

But he's kind of waving off, saying, no, I don't need umbrella. I'm going off school. I'll be okay. So he goes out the door, tells mom goodbye, and he gets out there going on his way to school, and it starts raining.And you can see he's got a little word there and rains more and more. Now it's a downpour and it's raining pretty hard and he's kind of running to get out of the rain. And he ran back home. And see, his mom is kind of upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the umbrella. So then he gets the umbrella to go off to school and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella."

And I thought, I think I better stop because it's getting too hot.So I cleaned up, I had a shower, and I went shopping. I was looking for curtains, and it was getting later because I always like to get home by 03:00 to watch my program. So on my way home, I was passing another store which had curtains. So I thought, well, let me check it out in there. So I went in there, and as I'm walking around, all of a sudden I'm like the light was going in and out.Nothing hurt. Nothing hurt, but it was just getting weird. And I thought, what is happening? So I thought, it must be from the heat. So I thought, I'd better go home.I'm driving, and I'm by myself. So I went home, got cooled down, and I had something to eat. And then I sat, and my story came on. And I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything, but all of a sudden, my son who lives with me, he's calling me, and he comes home about 05:00. And I open my eyes and he says, what are you doing?He says, you should be cooking. I says, oh, you're home early. And he says no. He says, it's 05:00. So between that time when the story was about to start and 05:00, I was out, but I could talk, I could walk.Nothing bothered me. But I got in the kitchen and I stood there and I said to him, what do you mean I have to cook? What am I cooking? Supper? Okay.So I took a few more steps, and I says, what do I have for supper? What am I making for supper? He says, what you were we were making lamb chops on the grill, and I had them marinated. And I says, well, what was I making? So he told me, and I says, where are I didn't even know where they were.He says in the refrigerator. And I didn't even know what a refrigerator was. And then I started to get not scared, but something's wrong with me. Because I'm talking I'm talking very clear and everything, but I didn't know anything that was going on in my mind. I did, but I couldn't get them out.So he looked at me and he says, what's wrong with you? I says, I don't know. Something's wrong with me. So I have a daughter who lives in Vernon.

And they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't invited.And only they went. So after they were gone, the fairy godmother showed up and showed them how she could do it. And so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and all. And then Cinderella was given a fine dress to wear. And then when she got to the ball the only thing, the only thing when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but Cinderella.And they danced the night away.

Never heard of such a word. Then she explained to what it was. I was like, oh, well, okay, I guess it lanes why I'm struggling here.And so while I was in the hospital, she provided a lot of papers for me to think of words and some simple math to do, but mostly words. And I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next. And it was, like, really important to me. I was just super motivated.And then when I was released, it was going to be a month or so before therapy would start up. And so I contacted her again, and I said, can you email me some stuff? Because I just, okay, so I can't see anybody for a month, but I don't want to let up here. And so she sent me a lot. And just like in the hospital, she was willing to send me as much as I could handle.And I was so thankful for that.I'm not in the hospital. So I didn't give it to her to check it. Now I just figured that's not right, but it's tough to keep doing. And I got adult coloring books because of a high fine motor skill issues with my right hand. And I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids reading and math workbooks for looked like about a third or fourth grade.That's where I estimated my level was at at the time, because when I looked at higher grades, like fifth and 6th, I was like, I can't begin to even do this stuff. But third or fourth, it was like, okay, this is a little bit of a reach for me. Let me start here. And so I did that. And I got puzzle books for kids to do, and so I did those.And I always did like to cook before, but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food, and I wanted to be food that tasted good. And so I got some healthy recipes and worked on those. And I was surprised to see that I struggled with conversions like a jar of garlic. Half a teaspoon is one clove. And when the recipe called for two cloves, I struggled with that.I was like and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon, so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work. Um, and I learned to highlight in the cookbook everything that was going to be put in the first bowl, I would highlight in one color."

I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not, but probably not, because there wasn't anything to work with.I couldn't talk, I couldn't do anything. And interestingly, in July, so that was May. In July, middle of July, somewhere, I had another stroke. And at that point, I was in a rehabilitation center, a rehab hospital, and they took me by ambulance because I could feel that something was going on. And I was afraid it was a stroke, but I couldn't say it was a stroke, but I knew there was something going on and Sharon could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem.They took me to the hospital and did scans and so forth, and sure enough, I had another stroke while I was there in the hospital.Um, up until that time, I could not move my legs at all. My hands, I i would know I couldn't do anything with it.That's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again. But while I was in the hospital, I started being able to move. And the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost my ability to focus my eyes together, so I can only see out of one eye at a time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side, and I'd wear it for a while over the side, but I couldn't really have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see with both eyes. I see with both eyes, but I'd see different things.And so when I had the second stroke or whether it's third stroke in the hospital, the vision started clearing up. And I remember telling me, Terrence here, I said, my vision is getting better. I can see better, I can focus, I can focus. With my turn up, I could. And then I also told her that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit, because when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not.You think you're moving it, but it really isn't. And I said, look at my leg and see if it's moving, because I really felt like it was. And indeed, it was moving. It was moving. So whatever happened in this second stroke was good for me because I was able to start moving a muscle.First time I was able to move a muscle, any muscle."

Okay, so the next question is thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be a happy moment or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently.First time I met my wife, when she and I first met, we are high school graduates. We went to different high schools together. Her from near Washington, Indiana. In Washington, Indiana myself from Plainfield. And it was before classes started at Purdue, august of 1972.It was her first day on campus. My first day on campus, there was to be a dance at the dorm I was staying at this one night. Again, each is our first day on campus.I was a little bit early, which I will arrive places a little bit early, given control of the situation. And so I ended up being just a little bit early for the dance there. And my wife and her wingman girls go with bodyguards. I get that Sandy and a wingman showed up there.Sandy's wife has never met a stranger. She is a true extrovert. Matter of fact, you look up in Webster extrovert and says, see Sandy Barton. But anyway, so she and a girlfriend, her wingman walked up to me and said, well, he is the dance here. Well, I answered all it's supposed to be.That's why I'm here.Hung around her, that dance. And that's where we started dating. We dated probably three years or so. Dated around about three years or so, and after about four years, figured out that, well, maybe something's going on here and ought to get more serious about this. So it was just I accuse her of picking me up at a school dance.That's where we first met is she picked me up at a dance. All right, here are some more pictures. Take a second to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Our images are covering up. The picture on the right. Okay, so if you hover your cursor over my hour pictures, you should see at the top there's a black line all the way to the left of that black line. Okay, got it? Good.All right, whenever you're ready.A young boy, looked like a grade schooler, had a soccer balls kicking it. Ends up going through a house window. A gentleman on a couch there in the window, him sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him. And then he gets the ball, stands by the broken window, trying to find out just what went on."

But there's two other sisters, and they get to do whatever they want during the day, but the other girl has to clean and do all the stuff that who wants to do, right? And I'm sure she's but she watches the castle, the big one, and I'm sure that she watches and thinks, oh, I wish I was over there.And then we get a letter that says they're going to do a it's not a party. There's a word, but I don't have it. The ball. That's what they call it. Yeah.So like a party in a way, but you dance and look beautiful, and everyone could go, and I think they're going to do that because they want the prince. I think he's a prince, and he needs to find a lady, and so there's a way to do it, I think. So they said, let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him.So when they got their paper, I think she even gets to go. They didn't say she couldn't go, but she had a beautiful dress in her I say, it's not a box, it's something pretty, but I don't know what they call those things. But she was looking at the dress and, oh, I'm going to look so good. And the other girls, they don't look as cute, but they looked her stuff, and they wanted this and that and dress and tore her dress and everything, and so they were going to go, and she didn't have things to put on now, and so she was sad. And the fairy, I think that's what she is.I don't remember right now. She's different than the one you watch her another way. Used to be a small one. Now she's a Role lady, but she was there, and she said, I can help you. And so she takes the rats and the dog and everything become people."

And then she looked at the clock, which I forget to tell you, but she is only allowed to be there until midnight. And so she kept looking at the clock.She's good at that. She's watching as they were dancing, everything. She thought, oh, I got to go. And so, of course, he probably said, can we just stay longer? And she said, no, I got to go.So she's running, and I'm sure even one of the guys who worked there even had a question, and I think she said, I got to go. As she went, one of her shoes fall down, and she gets all the way home, and of course, you see, the pumpkin is back down to what it is back, and there's the dog, and everybody's sitting there, and I'm sure she's thinking, that was the most beautiful day I've ever had. And I don't know if she's even know if she'd ever see him again, but at least she had a real beautiful day night.But there's a guy coming back at all the houses, I think, to see where that shoe came from. And I think that new mom said, uhoh, I think it was her, which they probably knew it was her at the beginning, because she looked way too good. And so they locked her in her room or in the palace or who knows? She is I don't know. It's always bad over there.They stuck her in there, but here comes one of the little mice that got the key to let her in to get out of there. And so when she got in there, they said, of course, it wasn't the two girls, because she had big feet, and she doesn't look good. So I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point. And then there she is. She said, well, can I try?And so she sits down, and it fit.She made it. And so they took her back over to the castle, and they get a Mary and what is it called? Happy whatever you call it. This is all my cup. I wish I could read it, because it's always the thing at the end after kind of thing.Right? Yeah.

As I say, I probably am familiar somewhat with the story, but it's not something that I remember hearing very clearly. So let me just look through so, Ted, we've gone through most of the free speech samples.This is all of the basic storytelling stuff and most of the picture descriptions. So now this is the narrative sample, and then there'll be a procedural discourse after that, just giving me an idea of where we're at. No, there will be some tests afterwards, too, but this is certainly reminding me about how unfamiliar I am with the Cinderella story. Okay. You want this in detail, as detailed as you'd like to provide, but I have to steal this back.Okay. All right, let's see. Story of Cinderella. So Cinderella is I don't know whether do you want me to kind of just describe it or try to act it out? So whatever you prefer to do.But the goal of the task is just to get you to provide a narrative telling of a story. Okay, so the story of Cinderella in miniature. Okay. So Cinderella is the maid of this aristocratic family, a couple women who happen to be rather unattractive. But whereas Cinderella is really a very attractive girl, and she longs to be in their position, she longs to be in the top ranking in the aristocratic she longs to be an aristocrat s.And so what she does is she worships these two girls, and they treat her really quite badly. And so Cinderella has a dream about, or a longing at least, to have their lifestyle, and she has a dream where she is not really a dream in reality. She pretends to be one of the daughters, and she is found out because the shoes that her daughters wear do not fit. They're much too big for Cinderella. They do not fit on her feet.And so when she goes and she's now dressed, pretending to be one of the girls, and she is found out because the shoes do not fit, but the man who is her, who is in the what are the little animals have to do with this?

It took much longer than normally to do the puzzle, but I was able to complete that and then had normal evening and went to bed early. I got up the next day and went to an exercise class with a group that we meet early in the mornings on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And this was a Friday morning that I'd gone to work on Thursday couldn't work. So then Friday when I got up, I went exercise with the group.And with the group, we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit, warm up. And while we're walking, we talk and visit with each other. And when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group, what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the words that I was speaking. The words were correct, but they were not making sense as complete words. So I knew there was something wrong.My friends knew there was something wrong. When I got through the exercise class, we spent an hour exercising together. I went home and had breakfast. I told Patty, I said there's something wrong. I need to go to the doctor, that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor.And she decided that rather than that would take me to the emergency room. And there at the emergency room, they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke. So I spent the next three days there was a problem with my heart. My heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm. And so they spent most of the time for the next two or three days correcting that issue.And then after they corrected that, then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia, and they discovered that I had a stroke and had aphasia. So that's pretty much where I am.That sounds like it could have been really scary, but you just handled it like it was another day. Well, I tried, you know. I just thought I had a headache. And talking with Patty later, she said on the Wednesday, the day before, I woke up with a headache. She said, you had a headache that day too?Like Wednesday night, late. I mentioned that I had a headache then, so I don't remember that at all. That part of it.Do you still play Sudoku's? Yes, I do. Very nice. My grandpa got me into Sudoku's.

She mostly worked terribly.The other three daughters were, of course, hideous and vicious, and they didn't stay in the equipment, but anyway, they had a quiet. They had another spot of servants quarters that they had to keep. It was a beautiful day. You could see the King's castle twinkling in everybody's eyes as they looked besides. But luckily, there was something that helped Cinderella during this time.Mostly some rodents that appeared constantly in what would have been, I guess, very needed would have needed a can't do it. Never mind, let's forget that part. And also there was a horse lying around and I think maybe a dog as well. At that point, the two other daughters of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today, presumably for the prince's birthday or something like that there. Cinderella thought, oh, this is going to be fun.And she got a little dress herself. And yet the two nasty daughters said, now she's not going to come. She can't stay. She's observant. And they were the old bourgeoisie at the place, so it's fine.There's just no being here. Fortunately for Cinderella, who would have been no doubt weeping for the misery of not being at the castle, cinderella had a fairy godmother who told her about this, and she said, well, fine.

Then there came a what do you call those creatures?It's a magic personage.I like call those creep. Anyway, this magic personage wanted to change all of the things that Cinderella wanted to read.She wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened. And it was the magical creature that made that all possible. Then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw the prince. And the prince was quite enchanted by the prince completely, whereas the horrible creatures that lived in the house had no real particular interest in the prince. Sooner or later then, the prince was doing quite well.But it was time for Cinderella to leave because she had to do. And eventually then the wonderful time that they had disappeared. Nevertheless, everybody wanted to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for. And yet that was not to be the case. And then only did Cinderella take all of her fancy clothes once again, and sure enough was exactly the person that they were hoping for.Then the prince went clonking back to whatever they are, to all of these, to all of the workers that they have to deal with.

Well, when she's gone, it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend.She must have been sleeping in the stable with the animals. I guess.In one picture, she was making tea for the two daughters.She was doing their laundry. She was doing all the work. And like I said, she had become more of a slave than anything else. So they lived in the shadow of castle, and I think she dreamt about the castle.Looks like she was in one picture. It looks like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that what it looks like, in a way.It turns out that the king fat king why, the little short white king is not short fat, but he is is looking for somebody to marry his daughter. And he's going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so that the girls can have their pick of they can't have their pick, but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball. And they'll have a chance to show up to that prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him. So he sent out this invitation. And of course, the wicked stepmother, or whatever she is the mother she, of course, doesn't want Cinderella to go to the mall, so the other girls go off to the mall, and Cinderella stays home, and she's got a tent of the animals or whatever.So the fairy godmother came along.

So I went to I went to choose my left right arm, couldn't move it, couldn't move my right arm, and I didn't even try to move yet.Well, I better get this going. And it simply didn't move. And so I got down on the ground and get towards my moon, my phone, and try to pick it up and try to phone it for something. I couldn't get anything for phone, it was really difficult. And I said, well, I put it down and I tried to grow curl, curl up, go up.This was way down. And I estimate it's about I have to move about 03:00 A.m.. And I simply didn't move. I thought about it and I was also talking, not talking, I heard myself hearing, no hearing, I heard myself, and I just was a little bit tired again. So I went to bed to write on the copper carpet, and I woke up in daylight because I have no passage of time.I presumably went from the time I went away, my closest way, closest way that they I must have I must have gotten away, say, two days ago. Two days went, and then someone called me, and I called on the radio, I picked it up and I spoke and I said nothing. All I said was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, nothing."

And then they go to the dance.910 o'clock at night, she's dancing with the prince and she has her shoes, glass shoes, and they're very small. And she realizes that at 12:00 that all of the magical stuff is going to be gone. And she's gonna so she so she realizes that it's almost 12:00 and she runs away from the dance or whatever it is, and she lost one of the glasses shoes. So she's back at the house where she's like she just helps out. And the part of the king found the grass shoes and everybody tries to put their feet in it.And of course the two daughters, of course it doesn't say that, but I'm sure that's what happens. Everybody in the town, the glass shoes, their feet are too big. And then the young used to be a blonde with a blue hair.She actually fit the glass shoe. And they realized that she's really going to be a princess.The other thing is that I'm confused about when she goes to the dance, she has a kind of a white pink dress. But then she's at the dance and she's got a much nicer it's a gown, perhaps. It's white, very beautiful. And she's got the grass shoes too. And she runs away.I don't know what happened to that white gown. She's got the pink and white one. She's back in her bathroom down probably down in the sulla where she lives. And then she could fit the grass shoe. And she's going to be the one that the prince and the princess are going to be married."

And during that time, I met a I don't really know how to describe him. He's he's kind of a he's he's kind of a he does not have a he's not he's not a PhD. But he is a doctor of education or something like that, but he is very good at working with stroke people in in terms of in terms of cognitive ability, and I worked with him for about almost four years, and in fact, I just quit working with him maybe in the last six months.We went to his office went to where he had an office. He didn't have an office there.He came to a university here and he would meet with people there at the university. And I was still in wheelchair at that time, and I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was actually in a walker for another year. And then when I went to walking with a cane, I continued working with him. But I wish I could explain exactly what he does. But he works with the cognitive abilities, and he helped me a lot.In fact, some of the things that we've done here reminded me of some of the stuff that he's done that he did with me, telling stories and a lot of different tests that I'm sure you're very familiar with.But he was able to work with me and just pull stuff out of me and make it work."

So the woman was the other girl's stepmother and she was the mean stepmother. And she made her clean and she made her do all the work. So as she grew older, she kept looking at the beautiful.She looked at all the other houses and where the king and queen lived and she hoped someday she might meet the prince. So the king was talking to one of the men there and said they should have a ball because the prince should be married. So the stepmother and her daughters were all talking about how they should make beautiful dresses and the stepdaughter should make them for them. So they had her make the dresses and she said she wanted to go to the ball, but they said, how could an ugly girl if you go to the ball because you don't have one? So she went to a room and the animals made her one.No, the animals didn't make her one yet. She found parts of dress in her box, in her chest, in her chest left from her mother when she died, a beautiful dress that she was going to wear to the ball. But when her stepmother and stepsister saw it, they ripped it up and she had nothing. And she was crying, and so the mice said that they would help her, but she got locked up and they said she couldn't go. So she was crying and crying and crying, and the other ones her stepmother and the stepsisters, two stepsisters went to the ball and she's crying and her very godmother came and the very godmother came and she made her a dress.And the horse became the carriage. The horse became the carriage and the mice became the mice became different things to carry the horse. Oh, the mice became a horse and one mouse was a horse and one mouse helped her get on the carriage and made her beautiful dress. So she went to the ball and they saw her there and they couldn't believe it was her. But she danced with the prince and the prince fell in love with her.But she had to be home by the stroke of midnight. And by midnight the bell rang."

But it seems like when I get in a situation where I'm in a hurry is more when my speech or I lose some of the words that I want. And I found that going to the hardware store, for example, with particular part, or I know I'm going to have to talk to somebody to describe something, I write it down in my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it. So that's what I do for my help. That's a really great strategy.Do you remember your stroke?I do, because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache. Okay. I normally in the morning go out, get the paper, have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work. And I went out, got the paper, I still had a splitting headache. I took a couple of aspirin, came in and had a bowl of cereal for breakfast.And while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper and I opened it up and I could not read what was on the newspaper. I couldn't see a whole paragraph. Blocks of characters were missing altogether. So that's the first thing. So I set the paper aside and said okay, I'll read it when I get home and got dressed and went to work.I driving from work, 22 miles from my house to the office. And what I was seeing on the highway again on the dashboard of the car, I couldn't see all of the instrumentation on the dash, but I was able to drive fine and go to work, no problem at all there. When I got to work, I tried to log in to my computer at the office. I couldn't remember my login, didn't know how to log in and I still had the headache. I talked to my boss and told her what was going on.She said just take it easy for a while and see if you can later remember. And I took probably half hour 45 minutes and still couldn't. So I said I just can't do it, I'm going to go home. I came home, took a couple more aspirin and went to bed, slept the rest of that day. That was on a Thursday.On Friday morning I got up and I exercise on Friday, Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays I exercise in the group early in the morning. So I went to exercise class and I exercised. But when I was with the group, I was talking and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me, wasn't making sense to any of my friends.The words were correct, but what words that I was speaking were wrong words. They didn't fit with what I was saying. And so I said there's something wrong, there."

And so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that Cinderella was a happy, wow, could I ever do something like that, you know? But they show that the other two stepmothers see it and that their mom. And they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen.This is hard. But the mom realizes, uh oh, better not have with Cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen. So Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready. And again, I always liked that part of the movie, as I recall, because I liked how the little animals were even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful. So they made us made her beautiful thing.But then the stepmother got where she couldn't go. And so then Cinderella was really crying. As I remember, that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken. And how could they not even let me do anything? And then this very godmother person pops out of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be driven.She gets there and she can dance. And he sees her and wants to dance with her. And he's captivated by her. And all of a sudden, Cinderella realizes, oh, no, it's by this midnight where she has to leave before everything was going to change back. So Cinderella gets home and she's still kind of happy, which is I thought that was always amazing.She was still just happy and so honest about, wow, I got to actually do something like that. She thinks that's the end that would ever be. But she was still happy. And so then with the prince, he is like, I have to find out who that was. Which I wouldn't really blame him.Of course he's going to want to meet her and goes. He probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her. So he has to go has a decree, I guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person. Has to figure out who that was because oh, yeah, I forgot when when Cinderella was leaving, she left one of her things. I can't think what it's called behind your foot thing."

And then I say a brain injury because I think it was about one day or two days later I developed a double vision. Ah. And that was the most except for extraordinary pain in the leg from that not knowing if the double vision would ever go away was most disconcerting, if you will. It did finally go away when the brain swelling went down.Finally went away. But I recall maybe three, four or five days after that, something like that. But it lasted a significant amount of time and the doctors could not tell me whether the double vision would ever go away.It was extraordinarily painful. And then I recall that the Orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my tibia said after three or four months when all the fissures in the tibia fibula started to heal, he said, oh, that's probably the most painful injury known. Painful injury known to man. Oh, okay, back. It's just me being a big baby then, right?He chuckled at that.Those are the two actions at a top level."

And in the process, somehow the ladder maybe the dog hit the ladder, but the ladder got knocked down so the guy couldn't get can climb down the ladder. So they had to call the fire department and they came and a couple of firemen there come running with a ladder and they're going to get the guy down from the tree.Now the cat, in the meantime, is sitting up in the tree. And I don't know if he's taking a nap or just he doesn't really care. He's not bothering him. The little girl probably must have been riding her tricycle because it's sitting there, but she's now trying to coax the cat down. There's a bird there in the tree and he's just kind of singing away and probably is oblivious to everything else that's going going on.Um, that's pretty much it. The girl's got pigtails and all that, so maybe she's tomboy or something. I don't know."

Like, I didn't know where to put my receipts anymore.I'm pretty focused on doing that stuff. Couldn't figure that out. And then I saw another receipt because I got ordered like, $1,700 more worth of books. And I remember looking at it going, what does this mean? And then I just was like, Never mind, I can't think about it right now.And in addition to that, I was going to school. So altogether, while at school, I been in digital arts classes, so I was in a flash class, making movement like little cartoons. And it was the same kind of thing where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things. But our final project, I'd go back to it and couldn't figure out how to do it again and again and again. And the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing that we'd done right before that, I put it in like seven or eight different programs.So now I look back and I go, oh, I wasn't stupid or unable to do it. It was this thing in my brain. So."

For example, when I was reading, I had to read, write down what I believe I just read, and then practice saying the words. And I've been doing that now probably for about three and a half years.

But we did see once in a while when we go to a family gathering or go to their house because Denise would be there and her friend would be there and so forth. And so that was like 1991 or something like that.Well, to make a long story long, denise's friend then moved to married and went and moved to California. She was out there for about a year and she came back to Wichita and her husband came back to Wichita and her husband had a heart transplant.If he's having a hard time following this, that's okay. I'll try to bring it all together. He had a heart transplant and it didn't take very well. Heart transplants are long, drawn out things. He lasted about five years and finally he gave out.In the meantime, my wife with Huntington's disease was moved to a we had her in a nursing home. She spent five years in a nursing home and her nursing home was in the same town about four or five blocks away from Sharon's friend. I had no idea that she lived there. I had no idea that she lived in that town or anywhere. So at one point, my wife finally she went downhill and went downhill and passed away.In 2002, I called Denise, my sister in law, to tell her that Judy had passed away. And Sharon and Denise said, I can't believe it. Calvin just died yesterday. And Calvin is sharing something. They both died within one day of each other.Strange coincidence over time.Not right away, but over time. Sherman was living up there in Cedric, the town of Cedric where the nursing home was. And at some point Sharon said denise said, you know what, Denise?Sharon actually lives there, just a few blocks in that nursing home. Did you know that? I said no. I had no idea."

I says, There is something else wrong with me. So then all of a sudden, her name came because it's going through my mind.And I says, Donna, there is something wrong. And I started to cry. So she says, mom, stay on the phone. And she got her other phone, and she called the doctor, and the doctor said, Get her up to the hospital. So they took me up to the hospital.She called her husband, who worked down this end, and he came, and my son took me to the emergency room. And I was there for, I guess, about 12 hours, 13 hours. And they didn't know what was wrong with me because every question they asked me, I said right off, correct everything and count backwards. We're right back, and we were talking, and I was walking around. I had to go to the bathroom.I knew where the bathroom was in the hospital. And I went there, and we came out, and we were talking and talking. And the one doctor said, we're not sure what is wrong with you. Everything seems to be fine. Everything is connecting with you.So in the meantime, I didn't realize that I didn't know the names of all my other family, so they just kept me there. And Allison, the one doctor, says, well, you've got a choice. It was on a weekend, which is a bad time, february, Fridays. And he says, you have a choice. You can either go home for the weekend and come back Monday, or you can stay over the weekend.Now, when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything, they're not going to say, oh, I'll stay at the hospital, especially on a weekend. So we went home. So my son in law took me home to his house, to my daughter's, and I was there for the weekend, and they had gone away for the weekend. Not the whole weekend, just overnight, that one day, because originally I was supposed to babysit for them anyway. So just by luck, my daughter said to her husband, Bring your father up too.I don't think mom should be by herself because I had two grandsons, and they were little. So the father came up, and it was a good thing he did, because I started to fall apart. I cried just like that, and I just wouldn't stop crying. And then all of a sudden, I'd sleep. I'd sleep for hours, and I didn't realize it.And then we went the weekend, we went to the doctors, and well, she seems to be fine. She's talking. She's doing this and she's doing that. But there is something going on with my head, I says. Something's wrong there.So anyway, I went home."

But Cinderella starts with she had a wonderful mom and also dad, father and mother, and they were loving and kind, and she was too. And something happened, which a lot of old Disney movies did, showing that one of them passed away and that was her like mother. So her dad, her father met this other woman and decided to he'd like to have him and her get married.And as I always watched it, probably most of us seeing that would go, oh, no, don't be marrying this particular person. But he did. And that person had a couple daughters that she owned. And it's shown that they're all very mean, not only to Cinderella, but even to very all they think about is themselves. And the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money when she gets married.So they realize that Cinderella is just a very beautiful, very she's very pretty and beautiful, but she's inside, she's just a really sweet person who cares about people.I think it's called stepmother. I think that's what it's called. Realizes she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing, working with her. So Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy, wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life, because all that she can do is constantly clean and wash and whatever else she has to do, cook for the other three people. But yet, during that time, cinderella still stays somehow basically happy, at least for the most part, and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them.And so around that time, the the prince, his dad, I can't think what that's called, wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all."

And I said, what do you think of this, Jeff?And he said, I think you should go because it is offered in Lynn, and it is all of the principals, like about four of them are going to put on a presentation and talk about it and then see if you would like to. And I said, oh, okay. Yeah, okay, I will. So I went and I said, oh, wow, I think I will do this. And for two years I had to go.And it was at Gordon College, but they brought it to Lynn because of all of the participants were from Lynn except for one person. So after school at the Ad building, they would come and we would do a class a semester. And it was very interesting. It was School Administration, foundations of Being a Principal, one and two and things like that. And oh my God, I loved it.In two times for my paper, I interviewed Jeff because he has so much knowledge in one time, my teacher, she was the superintendent of I know it, but it oh, Newberry Poor."

They must have.Oh, because again, the other girls went to the ball. Cinderella wished she could, and when she wished, the woman appeared, who I cannot come up with a word for what that magical woman was called, but she came up. She showed up and she raved her magic wand, gave her a nice dress and sent her off to the ball.

They didn't know how long at the hospital. As it turned out, the day after she came to evaluate me, I was discharged, so I knew that I had problem speaking. So I had asked if I could forego my physical therapy because I was doing well, I was walking and all that, but they said that, no, you have to finish your physical therapy before you can start the speech therapy. So I had home speech therapy was very good.The therapist was very good, and she was actually the one that after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use ten sessions after that. She was the one that mentioned that I should go to the speech clinic at Buffalo State in New York.A lot of that was to get my memory back. A lot of the things were I guess it's pretty typical things where I have to tell stories.It's hard to explain how it took. I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist, and after a couple of sessions with the neurologist, he said there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it, but if I have any other problems, you know, they could call. One of the things they did, they did probably one of those cognitive tests. I did them, and I did okay, I guess, probably sound like the stuff that they said that President Trump aced. I had some problems with it, but on I had brain damage, so I guess I had a reason, but that's about."

Perhaps the young girl maybe wanted the cat out of the tree.So then I'm guessing a man tried to help by climbing up the tree on a ladder. And then the ladder fell over once he was in the tree. So now he's stuck in the tree. I think the dog is upset. And just perhaps, maybe the guy came over with the dog and now the dog's upset.His owner is in the tree, and somebody either called or the fireman saw that the man was stuck and they're running over the tree with a ladder.

So that and then to end up with this beautiful baby. So, Leah, that was a very pleasant, wonderful thought."

Well, I guess basically what's going on is I'll say that girl is riding around on her tricycle, and for some reason, I'm not quite sure why, she notices that her cat or a cat is stuck in a tree, and she's very upset that the cat is stuck in the tree. So she must yell to a neighbor and say, this kitty's stuck in the tree. Please go get the kitty. And he comes running with a ladder, and he climbs up the tree trying to get the kitty.And apparently while he's up on a branch, this ladder falls down. Maybe that fell down because the dog came around and started barking at either him or the cat. And so the poor guy is stuck in the tree. The cat is stuck in the tree. So somebody called the fire department and they came over running.There's a bird. I don't know why the bird is in the tree chirping, but bird is saying something about the whole thing. As the fire department comes running over, there the ladder, trying to save the man and the cat in the tree."

I just remember brief periods for about a day. Then I remember being in bed and being told by the doctor different things to do each day. I had exercises, I did the classes I went to for like, four weeks.I'd added the hospital.Tell me a little bit more about your recovery. You just mentioned a little bit, but what other things did you do to get better? To get better after your stroke? I did those things that we did exercises, and the exercises were different things each group. And then we had a person who worked with us on doing things like scrubbing ourselves, getting ourselves clean, dressing, eating.So we dress, undress, dress, clean, take baths, and then we'd eat lunch, breakfast, lunch and dinner. And then in between we had classes where we do different things.Sounds intense. Yeah. Well, that was pretty interesting. In the beginning, you didn't know that much. Like, you'd be told to speak and you had a hard time.So now, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently, something important that happened to me. I graduated from college in 1971. I graduated magna cum laude, which was with otters, and I then went to the Marine Corps and went through training to become a second lieutenant. And I was a second lieutenant in Vietnam.And luckily I made it, I lived through it. And that was pretty much my college of freshman year. I mean, my graduating college, going to the Marine Corps. I became a lieutenant because I was going to get drafted, so I enlisted, and then I ended up getting out early because we pulled out of the Vietnam. So I was in Vietnam for ten months as a lieutenant at a captain."

And when we went down the road, I don't remember who or how it was decided which hospital I was going to, but I think I went to the best possible one. And when went there, there's like four of them in a row down there.We call this hospital row. So my street is always the first in the city to get paved. Well, maybe the governor's and then mine.Then she didn't understand where to go exactly. I think she knew she wanted the emergency room, but didn't know where it was. And I saw the red lettering and I couldn't read it. That is so significant to me because I remember I could not read that word. I knew what the word was, but I couldn't say it to save my life, but I could say I just couldn't read it.And so I pointed and I said emergency, and if I wasn't reading it, it was like, It's red. And I just know what that word is because it's red. And so we got to the entrance and there was like I want to say canopy, but not really a canopy, but something to keep you out of the rain and overhang or whatever. And I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or standing there. His job is to check people for weapons before they get into the hospital.And I waved at him and motioned for him to come, and he did. And I told him, I think I've had a stroke. And I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility. I don't even remember. And I said, But I'm afraid to walk.And I was walking fine, but I just never had a stroke before, so I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now. And all of a sudden I can't. I didn't know, so I was afraid to walk. So he said, Hold on, I'm going to get someone. And the nurse came out real fast, and she came out first, and then I told the same thing to her.And she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair. I think it was just inside the door. And so she got me in the wheelchair and we went in. And I remember looking at the people in the waiting room. It was pretty full.And I felt kind of guilty because I was being rushed to the head of the line. And I almost wanted to say sorry, but I think I had a stroke, but just not appropriate to really say anything. I just felt bad. And so then the intake person wanted my health insurance card, so I gave her that. And she asked me, am I on any medications?And I remembered the Metformin, but I called it glucophage. I think glucophage is. I think that's the name brand for it, but I couldn't think of metformin. And there were a lot of supplements I used to take and maybe a couple more meds.

I mean, it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down. I'd go up.And you had another time to keep getting better than you were. So it's been nice to keep going. If you keep doing a little bit to read, write, everything like that, it helps a lot better. Now I'm going to show you these pictures again. Just take a little time to look at them.They tell a story. Take a look at all of them. And then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. And you can start whenever you are ready.Okay. The boy was out outside with the soccer ball. He's kicking around and he kicked one really good, but he hit right in the middle of the window on the house there. So the next one over there looks like her dad might have been sleeping and jumped out pretty good when the soccer ball went through the window into the house. And the lamp broke down there too.But you really can't tell on number four. I can't see with my picture and you and Anne, I can't see what number four is on there. Really?If you click on my face, there should be a way to move the box to where you can see four.Which one are you saying? So if you click on this small screen with my face on it, if you click it and drag view options no, just like actually on my face, there should be a little your cursor should change. Is it on the top or the bottom? In the middle.Click and then you can drag it and move the box.Good idea. Here, just a second. Sure. You like, hey, mom, where you want to move this? So you know how to move this out of the way, because I can't see the last one here.How did I move that out of there? You'll click on the window with my face on it and drag it across the screen.And then drag it across this. I got you.Um, it looks like he is not very happy because he got his soccer ball, but he's still looking out here. I think the boy must have ran away. He ran away because he's still looking to see what he's."

When I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more a therapy for me, I went to the YMCA and got a membership in the Y and hired at the Y a personal trainer who didn't really know anything about Stokes. But she learned. She was very good at studying and learning. The first time that she saw me and I was so stiff that I couldn't move anything, my arm was just if you see it here, your arm is like this and it's clenched fist and everything.And the first time she tried to move my arm, it was like, holy cow, I can't move it. And it wouldn't move. She worked with me. I went twice a week to go with her.And then in addition to that, probably after a while I went started. I'd say, Sharon, take me down to the wine. I was still using my walker. I'd say, let me just take me down the wine. Let me walk around the track with my walker.And I'm sure people probably thought, stupid, here's this old guy walking around very slowly six times around the track for a mile, and it would take me half hour to walk around that lap. But I was determined to do it. And I did it. I did it. And then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane.I still go very slowly.I'm doing it. So I'm going to have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself. And I'm not trying to pat myself on the back. I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have, and I'm sorry for them, they don't. But I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive.I did not lose my drive. I've always been kind of driven anyway. I've always been driven.But I was driven to her to improve and to get better.I'm still doing that and I'm getting there. It will never come to an end, but I will keep working at it. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you?

It's finding what needed to be done and then working with me to get that. But basically went therapy three times a week for several months and then dropped down to a couple of times a week. And until finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us, I'd already done all of them and reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it.But starting I've got a squirrel running across my patio. Never mind, I'll let go of that one. But part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures that we saw with all the drawings of different things. I had the same thing sitting, go in a room, sit in here, look around, and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud until I can figure. Sometimes you know all these words, you know all these items, but you don't not able to pull those words out.And the same thing driving down the street, you look at, say a mailbox, say that word out loud. Mailbox, postop and hedges, whatever you see, make a name, bring a name for that item. And it's something that I've kept along with as long as I've had aphasia. Now when I look at something, I'll say the name of that item just to keep it going. So that's one of the things I do all the time.I don't even think about it. A lot of times it's just something automatic to do.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at them and then tell me whatever story that you see. The beginning, a middle, and end. Okay. The boy was out playing in the yard, kicking his soccer ball.He kicked his soccer ball a little too hard in the wrong way, and it hit a window and broke.The window, fell through right next to a lamp inside the house, and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor. I'm not sure who this person is, whether it's his father or his neighbor. And then the adult was watching out of the window, looking to see who had thrown that ball and broke his window.Do you think he's looking out angrily, or you think he's just curious? Well, at this point, we don't see his face."

They were more into that at the very beginning than other aphasia type stuff. They wanted to make sure I was able to walk again, because one side of my, um, body was starting to have trouble, they said, so they wanted you to start using your hands and your arm and walk around to be able to do all that. At the beginning, they started doing some little tasks for me, like we played cards to see how many cards I can find. Looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that.But we were doing that just here and there. Feeling I was also very sad, very emotional feeling I couldn't even remember who I was. And so getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are, I was more panicked than that kind of stuff. Once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many, two days, I figured out who people were that I remembered. So said, let's go for our therapy now.Let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, we started working on therapy. And they said, you have aphasia. And my talking I couldn't say anything. They were saying, like, do you want something to eat?I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me, like, a cup. Do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me, and I go, yes or no. It took me even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it.If you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out. Little things like that that I didn't remember. Then, once I was able to at least think a little bit more, we started with pictures like that bird and the boy and the banana. And that was our therapy starting, was the fact that being able to say certain words and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name, my kids, and everything else.So, still working on therapy myself. I have a book at home that I still do my homework every day, so still going. The only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write. And I said, But I told myself that I'm going to do it, so I'm not done yet. When it comes to coming up, I'm going to read someday, and I will write, and I will have numbers.At some point, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life?

I can't go back over them and over them and over them because there's nothing there in front of me. So that makes me nervous. But is the program good? Yes, especially for twits like me, who didn't have the time or energy.The moving thing, you need to keep repeating it and repeating and then go on.

And she realizes that she has to leave because everything is going to be changed back to the way her life is. And so as she is leaving from the ball, she leaves a slipper, a glass slipper. Depends on which story you listen to that is left at the ball. And so she leaves.And the prince doesn't know who this girl is. And all he has is this shoe. So now comes a point of trying to find out who this girl was and hopefully by checking the shoe if it fits, they had an edict from the king that all the women are to be checked to see who this shoe will match.So as Cinderella and her stepsisters are hoping that they'll be able to see the check the slipper, the stepmother doesn't want Cinderella to have that chance.So the stepsisters tried to hear fit the slipper and it doesn't. And as things change, Cinderella gets a chance to have the slipper to see if it will fit.

They finally got me in there.I could actually talk or anything like that, but I had to remember how to remember everything and room everything has gone back. I mean, everything about ABC, all that kind of stuff like that. Everybody's name, everybody, the computer on there, the coke sitting there, everything the wrong about it. You have nothing about it. You had to remember everything about it.So we went to I had like 30 days first that they brought in there, trying to get to see what I was doing, mostly to see what it was first. And then we went to after that. That's when we started to talk into getting the thing, make sure I don't forget something ten years before.But we did start like ABC one, two, three, or something like that. With my mom started to it's in Hooks. I went there, there was someone we got to talk over there and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all ABC, one, two, three, and stuff like that. It took a long time, it was about a year to start over that. And I've gone down.It was Monday to Friday. Now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks. Just try to talk a little better on that because I mean, at this time I could talk a little better, but it's just hard to get back everything out of there. So that helped different things about it for those six weeks, how you're trying to computer, trying to try to write on there, trying to do something about it.Got a little better there. And that's how they tried to after that they started IU and that's when they started with noun, verb, preposition, all those kind of things like that. There's so much you couldn't remember anything about it.But you just take your time trying to me and my mom helps with me all the time. Still trying to rewrite everything. Still I can't but if you had to rewrite things about it after you do that, you do very good about those things. But then you forgot about the other thing you did back. So it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time.So you just got to keep everything keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk. Mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much, people have no idea what I'm doing and they talk to me real quick. This is kind of weird because if one person talk to me, kills me. If there's three people, I can understand other people, I can understand what it is.So it takes time, how I'm getting around everything.It keeps going every year and still a cat. It's getting a little better. I don't know how long I can go, but it seems like I'm still doing something with it. And it keeps going over time. So I try to ride every day, all kinds of stuff like that.My mom's very helping in that. And my sisters have helped a little bit there, too. They need to do something like that. And I have my brothers, too."

        "transcript": "Okay. Now, Cinderella was a cinderella was I guess I think that Cinderella actually had to work for the kind of evil sisters and they weren't very nice to her. They made her do the laundry. Obviously, in the story here, all the animals love Cinderella because they're all around whenever she hasn't apparently they like her a lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her things.So the king had a son. He was looking for a look for a bride for his son.Yeah, he was looking for a bride for his son. And they were going to have a ball so they could all come and see who she would pick, all the ladies, young ladies in the kingdom. And she was looking out the window in this one picture, she was looking out the window, kind of dreaming about it. But she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball. So Bell went to the ball and while they remember exactly how it was, but she ended up, I guess the fairy godmother came while she was while they were at the ball.And fairy godmother took daughter to come to the ball and had a carriage that she would take her to the ball in as a pumpkin carriage and take them to the ball. And I remember this one picture that it seems a little weird that horses were sitting on their hind legs kind of with their feet up something. They were standing there on four legs.That was kind of weird. And so the fairground mother took her to the ball and she got the ball and went in. And nobody knew this knew who it was because she was so beautiful. Nobody knew who she was. And they had the ball and the prince liked her.And then the times run off in the clock, big clock, big Ben or whatever.And Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home, back home before midnight, and it was after midnight, and so she got up, she ran out and her stepper fell off and she got home without supper. And then the prince started looking for whoever it was that had this slipper. And he was trying the slipper on everybody."

        "transcript": "Sure. I went to bed on a Monday night after work, and just like any other night, I expected I was going to sleep and get up and go to work. The next day, about one or two in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom, and I was struggling to get the covers off, was laying on my left side, so I trying to get covers off with the right, and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were. And that was my first sign. Something was wrong.At first I thought, because I had the two cats and I thought they were laying on the covers or something, but the room was dark, and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my mind, and finally they came off. And then I started to take some steps. The bathroom was the next room over, and I was finding that I was exhausted. And I decided I would just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed, but I just laid on the floor.I laid there for about 30 minutes. My garmin told me what was going on, the timeline. And so when I got back up, I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom. So I didn't just crawl back in the bed. And then about I was awake, asleep, back and forth till about 08:00.And I was trying to figure out something's wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major and I was trying to decide it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart. And I didn't want to go to the emergency room and there'd be nothing wrong. But I called a guy from work. I used my phone, and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number, so I want to leave him a voicemail message. And I was surprised to hear him answer, and that's when he told me, you called my cell number.So I worked for a very difficult company to work for, and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on, so I kind of jokingly told them something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day. And I said, Pass the word on my brain is not working right today. I won't be in. And so he just chuckled and said, well, okay, I'll pass that on. And then I called a friend and told him what was going on.And then between two of us, we decided, well, my idea, I will call him in a half hour. If you don't hear from me, call me. If you can't reach me, call for help. So half hour later, I called him, and I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did my neighbor next door came and got me and we went to the hospital.I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one. We got four hospitals to choose from, so I don't know why or remember why we went to that one, but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago."

And I worked hard at it for a long time, and then I got kind of afterwards, I've kind of gotten a little slow about it, or not slow, but it just haven't done it as diligently as I used to. But for the first months after the stroke, I worked hard at it trying to pull those pictures back. And I found that it's like learning in school again, grade school, you look at a word and you learn that word, and, oh, that's that word, and it comes back, and it stays back with aphasia.It doesn't stay there. It's more like having an electronic dictionary that occasionally gets scrambled. It's like, okay, I know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be. It's over there instead, that type of thing. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life to be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently, happy?I think when my grandson was born, he was a joy to be with, and I got to spend a lot of time with him when he was little as an infant, and watching him grow, and that was special. He's ten now, and he doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as I liked then, and he's off doing other things. Here are some more pictures that also tell a story. Take a second to look at them, and then whenever you are ready, tell me the story that you see with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay.Now, first of all, these pictures are under the last four stories, so I can't see what's there. There are two ways to fix that. We can click and drag our windows, or you can minimize it. All right, got it. All right, let's do this.There we go. Down below it now. Okay, boys, out kicking a soccer ball. He kicked it, got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad, but window came through the yard, and I'd say his dad saw it opened, looked out the window, and noticed who had kicked the ball.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at all of them, and whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see. It's a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay.In the beginning, mom sent little boy out go to school. He had a backpack."

But then the aunt was very nice. She made her pretty bad she had to go work outside and everything else and she's certain that dirt and all that stuff but her cousins were very nice they got to do whatever they wanted. They're kind of in the butt.So that's how it was for all the time. She tried to be nice, but they were still not very nice. But the one time they were going to have I guess they do for sometime the year, they get to see everybody. So they went to see if this would be see their their aunt took the two girls to make sure they were going to find one of the boy. The great boy is one of those that comes there.So they're going to go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that. But their cousin didn't know she was supposed to be there. But a what would you say?Not a ghost or something, I don't know but they had one that would bring on the way that's not normal how the people in Stoican it was totally different how they flew in here got them but they got a hold her and got her some different clothes in Stoican so she could go in that way. So she got to go in that place and went to see there that night got up, she could go sing and play or was out there, got some people and that's where they saw the big I think he's I don't know if he is the king or he might be just the new king coming there. He was with her for a while but then she had to leave and he was worried what happened to her but she left and he was worried about that but she did drop one of her shoes so he had that. So they went back, she was going back her place where she was just not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff but her cousins of course tried to told that it was her shoes and they put them on there and her feet are huge so it wasn't going to work on that. But then while they're there he did bring them over to her and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes so he knew what it was so he took her back and the best thing you could ever do she went back.She's like queen now so best thing that came on that way I was hoping you could tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich each.

He kicks it really hard, raises foot up so high that it goes way up in the air. And then you see the cycle ball travels through the air and hits a window.There are shutters on the window.It's a nice size picture. Not a picture window. Good one. Good size window. And there's some bushes outside the window.And the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp, knocks the lamp off knocks the lamp off the table but knocks the lamp over and so knocks the lamp over and comes through the window.The guy is sitting there probably watching TV or something but he gets up, picks up the soccer ball, walks over to the window and you know, the the window I think we talked about this last time. The window is there. The the lamp where the sack ball came through the window is not there anymore. The lamp is gone. The curtains are a little bit different there's.I'm not sure what what. I'm not sure what the edge there's. I'm not sure what some of the something is there. Anyway, the a looks out the window as though he's looking to see where it came from.But the lamp and the chair are no longer there.And I think the I'm going to say that the window ledge is lower than it was.

And it was not a very big spot, maybe a size of a quarter, where it had bled into my brain, but it stopped bleeding. It stopped, and everything was going okay. It stopped, and there wasn't really much damage.So Dr. Miffards then said, we can fix that pretty easily. We'll take you and put you in hospital. Take four or five days. I have to cut into your skull and go in there, and we'll take that fix that will actually seal it off, and then you'll be as good as new.Everything will be okay, and you'll be in the hospital for five days, and then you go home, and everything will be fine.So I went home from that appointment, feeling very good, Karen. I guess both felt pretty good. I continue practicing driving and so forth, and I went back, made an appointment to go into surgery on May the first I'm sorry, may the 6th. That had all happened on April Fool's Day, on April 1 of 2015.So I went in for the surgery on May the 6th of that year, 2015. And little did I know I wasn't going to come home for quite a while. I wouldn't be home for another six months. And in the meantime excuse the French fan. And it did big time.I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you. Okay. So that was my second stroke and did well. Okay.So what happened was, when I went into the hospital then to have that surgery again, some tip my tongue that I want to say what it is, maybe I'll think of it. So when I went to have that taken care of while when I was in the hospital, then they did the surgery, and the surgery was success.The problem was that when I went back, when I was in recovery from that surgery, I was in recovery and ignore that. Can sorry. Make sure it's not no, it's so when I the time or two, it'll go away. I'm sorry."

Told Patty that I needed to go to see my doctor. And basically at that time, the only doctor I was seeing was a heart, collect heart doctor. And she talked me instead to go to the emergency room. Went to the emergency room and they discovered that I'd had a stroke.And so they put me in the hospital. And I was there three days, basically, my heart was out of rhythm and beating too fast and lots of different things. So they spent three days basically just dealing with that heart issue, getting it stabilized, and then three more days basically discovering that I'd had a stroke and aphasia. And then I went home after the trying to think what day of the week it was. Wednesday.Wednesday I went home, and Thursday I drove back to the drove van, because I could drive, I could do everything I needed to do except talk. So I went to make an appointment with the speech therapy at that point, and that's where it started. Do you mind telling me a little bit about that? Like your recovery? So what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke?Well, it started out with something simple, because basically I could look at anything, know what it was, but I couldn't pull the words out. And so we started with the simple things, like in the room, for example, looking around the room, looking at each object in the room, naming it, trying to find the word and say the word out loud. So that's where it first started, and it built from there. And some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago, like with pictures, look at the picture, name the picture. And over time, that gradually got better and better.But that's where I think the start with the therapy was. And then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing, taking a paper and pencil and writing, I couldn't spell properly anymore. And that was something that I had to work at. So I found that with my keyboard, I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with notebook.Here the same thing. It has a spell checker and a spell I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker, but it starts out if you start the first few characters of a word, it gives you several different words that work. So that sometimes helped a lot as well, writing. So I've done a lot of."

Especially Patty, my wife, like, I think she ought to know this and then get the details, and then sometimes the details don't work well.It's usually the spouse.Do you remember your stroke?All I remember about the stroke was the fact that I woke up one morning with a splitting headache and it was so bad that I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had. Took a couple of aspirin, I went to outside and picked up the mail not the mail, but my newspaper, went back to have breakfast, and as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast, I tried to read, but I could not make it, read the paper properly. The blocks of words were just that. They were blocks, and some of it they weren't altogether. It's like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words, not the whole words.So I left the newspaper that morning and didn't read it and finished getting ready, went to work and drove to work. And on the way to work, I noticed that on the dashboard of the car, again, parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard, and parts of it I couldn't see. I couldn't see all the words, all that. But I was able to drive properly and drove to work, got to work, and when I got to work, I tried to log into my computer and I didn't know how. I think that's probably the best thing I could say about that.I didn't know how to log in. I didn't know my username, I didn't know my password, anything, and I just had a total blank with that. So I worked at it for a while and couldn't do anything. So I finally went to my boss and said, hey, I've got a problem. I've got a headache, and I just can't log in.And I was asked, Just take time and find a place to rest and relax and come back a little while and try again. So I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again, and I couldn't make it. So I finally said, I can't do it. I need to go home. So I went home, went to bed.When I got home, I took a couple more aspirin, went to bed and spent most of the day in bed, and I slept. And then when I got up in the afternoon, I was able to read. I was able to see a little bit more war with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that, but it still was problems. And I do Sudoku's puzzle."

Sharon had gone to get her haircut about 25 miles away, and I was working here at the house. I've been working on doing some carpenter work in the house, and I started to feel kind of numb in my right hand.I didn't feel too bad, but I knew from what people had told me, I'd heard many times, one of the signs of a stroke is numbness. In fact, I remember I was a fellow that I used to work with, had a stroke at work, and I remember going through that and kind of recognized from that how it looked. So I knew what was going on. I knew I was having a stroke against my well, I shouldn't have done it. But I called Sharon and I said, you probably need to come home.I'm going to go to the hospital. I don't feel right. I'm not sure what's going on, but just come on home. And I said, I'm going to head to the hospital. Just come on down to the emergency room when you get here.So I did. I went out and I got my truck, and I went to the hospital, which isn't very far away. It's six or eight blocks away from here.

And I said, I think I'm having a stroke.And they didn't waste any time, said, okay, somebody coming back. We're going to take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They took me, put me in one of the examination rooms, and they started to examine me. Sharon, it was about a half hour away, so she got there after this had started, questions. I think they already taken me to get a CT scan or whatever it was before she got there.So when she got there, I already had gone in to get a scan.When I was done with that, they took me back into the waiting, back into the room where I was, the treatment room, whatever you call it, in the emergency room. And I remember pretty well that Sharon was there. And I knew what was going on at that I had a stroke, but it felt like it wasn't getting any worse.

And when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me, he says, you had a stroke. He says it wasn't a big one, but he says, you had a stroke. It so that's how I knew I had a stroke.It was really, really weird. But I forgot so many things. Like in the morning, every morning after I got my breakfast ready, I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper and I couldn't read it. I looked at it and I couldn't get the words. I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words.And what I did get to read, I didn't understand. So I tried for a couple of days and I thought, the heck with this. I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days I'm sitting there and I thought, you are going to learn to read that paper. I started reading it now.I read a paper and it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning when I got up, after I went to the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there and I'd think of my daughter's family. There's four people in the family. There's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name, but I couldn't get his name out.And the two boys and I would just close my eyes and visualize it. And gradually, all of a sudden, I'd see their names and gradually it would come. Then I went with my older son, with his family. It was tiring. And I did that at night too, when I went to bed, before I went to sleep.I worked with one family at a time. And then my sisters and my brother and all that. And it was a long time, but it worked. It really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day, I says, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me.I says, I am so tired. And I says, I don't do anything. She says, mom, you are doing a whole lot. I says, Such is what? I says, all I'm doing is thinking about this one and thinking about well, that's it.She says, you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it. But it all came. It's just now I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out and that and when I write, it's getting better. Sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything and all of a sudden I look at it and I thought, no, that's not that word. And the first time I saw that was when I was going to the store, my little shopping thing.I needed mayonnaise. I'm writing and writing I get to the store and I came to that word, I couldn't figure out what it was. It wasn't even making any kind of sense. And I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping, I would keep going back at it and back.Now I have to think what was I going to do with this? Then I knew what it was. It would come. I forget it again.

And when I first met him, I'm just seeing this skinny teenager with acne, and I'm thinking he's just full of hormones. He's like, this is the last thing I want around my daughter. I got enough trouble with her anyway.They eventually got married, but she was determined. She didn't want any kids. She was just sure she would screw them up, and it's just too hard. And so me and my husband just see the world, and they did, they did a lot of traveling and everything.And I have a son, too, but he didn't seem to have any interest in getting married or having kids or anything. And so I just thought, you know, I may never have any grandbabies. I sure would love them, but if not, then okay. So I just worked in the church nursery and kind of helped get my baby fixed there. And then my son in law and daughter moved to Florida, and by this time, I realized through some different experiences that he loved her and was very protective of her.And I was always super protective of my kids, and I realized he was just as protective of her, if not more so than I ever was. And so I thought, he's going to cart her off to Florida, and I don't want her to be so far, but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for then I don't remember how long they'd been there, maybe a year or so. And she came back to town, and a relative on his side had a baby, and she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby. And I remember I took a picture of her with that baby, and I thought, she just looks so natural with that baby, like she's held them all her life.And she told me, I really want one now. And so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing babies, she lost two or three. And then when she had this one and maybe about six months in, I'm in Indiana, she's in Florida, and I'm nesting. I mean, my house is reasonably clean anyway, but I cleaned my whole living room once, and I just know it had been recently remodeled, and so there wasn't a lot of junk in there, but started pulling items out and going through them. And I cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows and just every crevice I cleaned in that living room."

If I was a little girl, I bet you I could remember all the details on this a lot better than I could.So then I think what you you get to see this this castle from the distance, and I think there's this young woman, and she looks like she works there. She probably works at somebody's house, and she probably had to like her job was to clean and she was trying to help out. She probably wasn't rich, but I think they were looking the major part of the story I think I'm going to continue with this is that they were looking for a young man, handsome man, who was going to get married.He was probably in the place again, I said it right, but now I've forgotten what to call it. The castle. They were going to have like a dance there with music, and they had this glass shoe that they found the right one that would fit, that would be his wife. So a lot of people came to the castle and they had the dance, doing dancing. And I think this young woman who was very good looking, she had to work there.Maybe it was the mother or something. But her two daughters, older daughters weren't very attractive, and they were probably hoping that they were going to be ones that would somebody this handsome man was going to marry her.So so mainly, I think they went to this I'm not calling it a dance."

Well, I got up in the morning and right away I rolled over and she was by my side. And I told her I felt a little queasy and she didn't see much about it. So then I went to the bathroom and I went to the bathroom and did my thing.And then right after I did my thing, something happened in here. And up I said, oh, no. And that's the last thing I remember for weeks.Do you remember your recovery? Do you mind telling me a little bit about the things that you did to get better after your stroke? Well, the last thing I knew before my stroke hit was after my stroke hit, I woke up and I remember this was Amsterdam, New York. So the next thing I know, I'm back in Wichita and I'm on a bed. My wife's there, and I slowly started talking to her.But at the first thing, I don't think I made much sense to her. But she was always there for me, so it was okay because I could tell her anything I wanted and she listened, did or whatever she could.And then after a while, two or three nurses would come in every day and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back. And every day it was something different. And I would go down the hall and they would do leg lifts trying to get me whatever. And I would do stairs. I remember that I did stairs.Did a lot of I don't know. I don't know. There was always somebody there, and there was always somebody doing something to me. A lot of it I don't know anymore.

About 01:00 or 130 in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom, and that's typical for me. And I had trouble getting the covers off. I was laying on my left side.I remember that because I had right side weakness, and the blankets just felt really heavy, and so I really had to work at it to lift the blankets. It was like they were full of bricks or something. And so I got them off when I just really focused on it. And then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom, the next room over, was too far for me to walk. I was exhausted.And so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed, and I laid there for about half an hour. And I think I kind of dozed off a little bit while I was down there. And then I got up and thought I'll try again, but as soon as I stood up, I realized, no, I'm still just too tired. So I crawled back in bed, and about 730 or 08:00, I decided to call a fella at work and tell him that I wouldn't be in. My boss was a creep, and so I avoided talking to him when all possible, but this guy was kind of the boss's pet, and so I'll just call him.And when I used my cell phone, I had that guy's cell phone number and desk number, but I thought, sure, I selected the desk number, because I was really not even wanting to talk to him either. But I thought I'll just leave him a message. Well, he answered the and so it had to be before 08:00, because I was really surprised. He answered the phone, and I said to him, brian, you're at work already? And he said, no, you called me on my cell phone.What's up? And I said, well, my brain is not working right today, so I'm not going to come in. And I chose those words carefully. I didn't want them to know there was a health issue, but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not coming in. And I certainly needed to make that call.He took it as a humorous and I was fine with that. That was kind of why I said it the way I did. And as a side note, when I came back to work, he recalled that conversation. He said, I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me. And I said no.Brian, I wasn't trying to tell you. Not this was not a call for help. I already had in my mind what I was going to do, but I just needed to let you guys know I wasn't going to be here. And so he was so relieved to hear that. And so I felt bad when he said that.I was like, oh, gosh, the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing. And anyway, so I called either before him or after him. My gentleman friend and I never call him. We've been going together for about six years."

Then after we work together a while, I'll test you again to gauge where you're at.The therapist I had worked with before that never explained that to me.

And I guess a lot of those, like, Disney shows do that sometimes.The dad was a good man, but like, a lot of people, I guess, would eventually think that maybe he might want to try to meet someone else. And so that ends up happening and really messed up by marrying this other woman who ends up she's just so cruel and so selfish.Okay, what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life. And so what I mean now is that what is that called?The other woman, she now has the power, I guess, where she's really being awful with Cinderella and I guess maybe even her dad might have died. I don't remember about that. Anyway, so they would show in the story then, now, how Cinderella, her life has just totally changed. She went through a really nice life, which was deserving to her because she was a very wonderful person, very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone. So now that the other mother is now there, the other mother makes Cinderella do everything, all the washing and everything you can think of, cooking, I guess, cleaning, whatever you do.And those two sisters that's called those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very, like, very snotty, horrible, don't even care about Cinderella at all."

I loved the work, but the people were just insane and bullied people to get things done. And I got to blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over.But I was afraid to look for another job, because if that next job doesn't work out, because I left this job on my own, I wouldn't get much unemployment. So I was really afraid to move. And there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work. So I felt really trapped. But I was looking, but it was just there really wasn't a lot to pick from.And anyway, the day three months or so before they laid me off, I just had a feeling it was getting ready to happen. So I started collecting my information that I was going to need later. And I put my notes in a notebook and I took them out to my car. And then when I wanted to refer to them, I went out to my car and looked at them. I didn't keep them at my desk.I took everything out of my office except for things that belonged to the company. I saved off programs, I had written, everything. So then when the boss and the HR guy came to my office and told me I was real happy about it, I tried not to look so happy about it, but I was really happy. And then I was out of work for ten months, and it was okay because I had unemployment, I had money, savings, and I was doing all right with that. The great thing is also that I got a wonderful job, and now I work from home full time for a company that's in Minnesota.And so my boss, as I have now, is wonderful. He's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice person. And I still do the same kind of work I used to do, but now it's for nice people.That's wonderful. Here is another set of pictures. Take a little time to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end.Okay.This boy is kicking a soccer ball and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window. And it went in and knocked over the lamp. And the man saw the damage. As it happened. He got up with the ball in his hand and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story.

And then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that, but there's a hole in the window.

But he's kind of waving off, saying, no, I don't need umbrella. I'm going off school. I'll be okay. So he goes out the door, tells mom goodbye, and he gets out there going on his way to school, and it starts raining.And you can see he's got a little word there and rains more and more. Now it's a downpour and it's raining pretty hard and he's kind of running to get out of the rain. And he ran back home. And see, his mom is kind of upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the umbrella. So then he gets the umbrella to go off to school and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella."

And I thought, I think I better stop because it's getting too hot.So I cleaned up, I had a shower, and I went shopping. I was looking for curtains, and it was getting later because I always like to get home by 03:00 to watch my program. So on my way home, I was passing another store which had curtains. So I thought, well, let me check it out in there. So I went in there, and as I'm walking around, all of a sudden I'm like the light was going in and out.Nothing hurt. Nothing hurt, but it was just getting weird. And I thought, what is happening? So I thought, it must be from the heat. So I thought, I'd better go home.I'm driving, and I'm by myself. So I went home, got cooled down, and I had something to eat. And then I sat, and my story came on. And I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything, but all of a sudden, my son who lives with me, he's calling me, and he comes home about 05:00. And I open my eyes and he says, what are you doing?He says, you should be cooking. I says, oh, you're home early. And he says no. He says, it's 05:00. So between that time when the story was about to start and 05:00, I was out, but I could talk, I could walk.Nothing bothered me. But I got in the kitchen and I stood there and I said to him, what do you mean I have to cook? What am I cooking? Supper? Okay.So I took a few more steps, and I says, what do I have for supper? What am I making for supper? He says, what you were we were making lamb chops on the grill, and I had them marinated. And I says, well, what was I making? So he told me, and I says, where are I didn't even know where they were.He says in the refrigerator. And I didn't even know what a refrigerator was. And then I started to get not scared, but something's wrong with me. Because I'm talking I'm talking very clear and everything, but I didn't know anything that was going on in my mind.

Never heard of such a word. Then she explained to what it was. I was like, oh, well, okay, I guess it lanes why I'm struggling here.And so while I was in the hospital, she provided a lot of papers for me to think of words and some simple math to do, but mostly words. And I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next. And it was, like, really important to me. I was just super motivated.And then when I was released, it was going to be a month or so before therapy would start up. And so I contacted her again, and I said, can you email me some stuff? Because I just, okay, so I can't see anybody for a month, but I don't want to let up here. And so she sent me a lot. And just like in the hospital, she was willing to send me as much as I could handle.And I was so thankful for that.I'm not in the hospital. So I didn't give it to her to check it. Now I just figured that's not right, but it's tough to keep doing. And I got adult coloring books because of a high fine motor skill issues with my right hand. And I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids reading and math workbooks for looked like about a third or fourth grade.That's where I estimated my level was at at the time, because when I looked at higher grades, like fifth and 6th, I was like, I can't begin to even do this stuff. But third or fourth, it was like, okay, this is a little bit of a reach for me. Let me start here. And so I did that. And I got puzzle books for kids to do, and so I did those.And I always did like to cook before, but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food, and I wanted to be food that tasted good. And so I got some healthy recipes and worked on those. And I was surprised to see that I struggled with conversions like a jar of garlic. Half a teaspoon is one clove. And when the recipe called for two cloves, I struggled with that.I was like and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon, so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work. Um, and I learned to highlight in the cookbook everything that was going to be put in the first bowl, I would highlight in one color."

I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not, but probably not, because there wasn't anything to work with.I couldn't talk, I couldn't do anything. And interestingly, in July, so that was May. In July, middle of July, somewhere, I had another stroke. And at that point, I was in a rehabilitation center, a rehab hospital, and they took me by ambulance because I could feel that something was going on. And I was afraid it was a stroke, but I couldn't say it was a stroke, but I knew there was something going on and Sharon could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem.They took me to the hospital and did scans and so forth, and sure enough, I had another stroke while I was there in the hospital.Um, up until that time, I could not move my legs at all. My hands, I i would know I couldn't do anything with it.That's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again. But while I was in the hospital, I started being able to move. And the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost my ability to focus my eyes together, so I couldn't really see out of one eye at a time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side, and I'd wear it for a while over the side, but I couldn't really have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see with both eyes. I see with both eyes, but I'd see different things.And so when I had the second stroke or whether it's third stroke in the hospital, the vision started clearing up. And I remember telling me, Terrence here, I said, my vision is getting better. I can see better, I can focus, I can focus. With my turn up, I could. And then I also told her that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit, because when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not.You think you're moving it, but it really isn't. And I said, look at my leg and see if it's moving, because I really felt like it was. And indeed, it was moving. It was moving. So whatever happened in this second stroke was good for me because I was able to start moving a muscle.First time I was able to move a muscle, any muscle."

We went to different high schools together. Her from near Washington, Indiana. In Washington, Indiana myself from Plainfield. And it was before classes started at Purdue, august of 1972.It was her first day on campus. My first day on campus, there was to be a dance at the dorm I was staying at this one night. Again, each is our first day on campus.I was a little bit early, which I will arrive places a little bit early, given control of the situation. And so I ended up being just a little bit early for the dance there. And my wife and her wingman girls go with bodyguards. I get that Sandy and a wingman showed up there.Sandy's wife has never met a stranger. She is a true extrovert. Matter of fact, you look up in Webster extrovert and says, see Sandy Barton. But anyway, so she and a girlfriend, her wingman walked up to me and said, well, he is the dance here. Well, I answered all it's supposed to be.That's why I'm here.Hung around her, that dance. And that's where we started dating. We dated probably three years or so. Dated around about three years or so, and after about four years, figured out that, well, maybe something's going on here and ought to get more serious about this. So it was just I accuse her of picking me up at a school dance.That's where we first met is she picked me up at a dance. All right, here are some more pictures. Take a second to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Our images are covering up. The picture on the right. Okay, so if you hover your cursor over my hour pictures, you should see at the top there's a black line all the way to the left of that black line. Okay, got it? Good.All right, whenever you're ready.A young boy, looked like a grade schooler, had a soccer balls kicking it. Ends up going through a house window. A gentleman on a couch there in the window, him sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him.

No, there will be some tests afterwards, too, but this is certainly reminding me about how unfamiliar I am with the Cinderella story. Okay. You want this in detail, as detailed as you'd like to provide, but I have to steal this back.Okay. All right, let's see. Story of Cinderella. So Cinderella is I don't know whether do you want me to kind of just describe it or try to act it out? So whatever you prefer to do.But the goal of the task is just to get you to provide a narrative telling of a story. Okay, so the story of Cinderella in miniature. Okay. So Cinderella is the maid of this aristocratic family, a couple women who happen to be rather unattractive. But whereas Cinderella is really a very attractive girl, and she longs to be in their position, she longs to be in the top ranking in the aristocratic she longs to be an aristocrat s.And so what she does is she worships these two girls, and they treat her really quite badly. And so Cinderella has a dream about, or a longing at least, to have their lifestyle, and she has a dream where she is not really a dream in reality. She pretends to be one of the daughters, and she is found out because the shoes that her daughters wear do not fit. They're much too big for Cinderella. They do not fit on her feet.And so when she goes and she's now dressed, pretending to be one of the girls, and she is found out because the shoes do not fit, but the man who is her, who is in the what are the little animals have to do with this? I can't remember."

It took much longer than normally to do the puzzle, but I was able to complete that and then had normal evening and went to bed early. I got up the next day and went to an exercise class with a group that we meet early in the mornings on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And this was a Friday morning that I'd gone to work on Thursday couldn't work. So then Friday when I got up, I went exercise with the group.And with the group, we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit, warm up. And while we're walking, we talk and visit with each other. And when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group, what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the words that I was speaking. The words were correct, but they were not making sense as complete words. So I knew there was something wrong.My friends knew there was something wrong. When I got through the exercise class, we spent an hour exercising together. I went home and had breakfast. I told Patty, I said there's something wrong. I need to go to the doctor, that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor.And she decided that rather than that would take me to the emergency room. And there at the emergency room, they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke. So I spent the next three days there was a problem with my heart. My heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm. And so they spent most of the time for the next two or three days correcting that issue.And then after they corrected that, then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia, and they discovered that I had a stroke and had aphasia. So that's pretty much where I am.That sounds like it could have been really scary, but you just handled it like it was another day. Well, I tried, you know. I just thought I had a headache. And talking with Patty later, she said on the Wednesday, the day before, I woke up with a headache. She said, you had a headache that day too?Like Wednesday night, late. I mentioned that I had a headache then, so I don't remember that at all. That part of it.Do you still play Sudoku's? Yes, I do. Very nice. My grandpa got me into Sudoku's. His name is actually also Jerry.So that's kind of a fun fact connection. Yeah."

Mother was very mom. Her mother was very angry with that idea and thought, well, I suppose that Cinderella can simply be a servant for herself and for her own two daughters. And sure enough, that's what Cinderella mostly did. She mostly worked terribly.The other three daughters were, of course, hideous and vicious, and they didn't stay in the equipment, but anyway, they had a quiet. They had another spot of servants quarters that they had to keep. It was a beautiful day. You could see the King's castle twinkling in everybody's eyes as they looked besides. But luckily, there was something that helped Cinderella during this time.Mostly some rodents that appeared constantly in what would have been, I guess, very needed would have needed a can't do it. Never mind, let's forget that part. And also there was a horse lying around and I think maybe a dog as well. At that point, the two other daughters of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today, presumably for the prince's birthday or something like that there. Cinderella thought, oh, this is going to be fun.And she got a little dress herself. And yet the two nasty daughters said, now she's not going to come. She can't stay. She's observant. And they were the old bourgeoisie at the place, so it's fine.There's just no being here. Fortunately for Cinderella, who would have been no doubt weeping for the misery of not being at the castle, cinderella had a fairy godmother who told her about this, and she said, well, fine. I have a special place that you can do. I will get you a beautiful dress so you can join with it, with me. And then I have also a magic here comes trouble coach, a magic coach that you can ride."

And so they had to to work all the time and had to deal with the hideous sisters while they were just having to be her work person. So at that point, then there was a moment where the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women in the town. And Cinderella was thinking, oh, this would be nice. I can have a really good time there.But they said, no, you can't do that.Only the terrible creatures that were living in the house are the only ones that could really do this. Then there came a what do you call those creatures?It's a magic personage.I like call those creep. Anyway, this magic personage wanted to change all of the things that Cinderella wanted to read.She wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened. And it was the magical creature that made that all possible. Then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw the prince. And the prince was quite enchanted by the prince completely, whereas the horrible creatures that lived in the house had no real particular interest in the prince. Sooner or later then, the prince was doing quite well.But it was time for Cinderella to leave because she had to do. And eventually then the wonderful time that they had disappeared. Nevertheless, everybody wanted to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for. And yet that was not to be the case. And then only did Cinderella take all of her fancy clothes once again, and sure enough was exactly the person that they were hoping for.Then the prince went clonking back to whatever they are, to all of these, to all of the workers that they have to deal with.

And I don't know, the story bent that, but that's what it looks.So she says, Great, I've got my two daughters, and they can all be friends. Well, when she's gone, it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend.She must have been sleeping in the stable with the animals. I guess.In one picture, she was making tea for the two daughters.She was doing their laundry. She was doing all the work. And like I said, she had become more of a slave than anything else. So they lived in the shadow of castle, and I think she dreamt about the castle.Looks like she was in one picture. It looks like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that what it looks like, in a way.It turns out that the king fat king why, the little short white king is not short fat, but he is is looking for somebody to marry his daughter. And he's going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so that the girls can have their pick of they can't have their pick, but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball. And they'll have a chance to show up to that prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him. So he sent out this invitation. And of course, the wicked stepmother, or whatever she is the mother she, of course, doesn't want Cinderella to go to the mall, so the other girls go off to the mall, and Cinderella stays home, and she's got a tent of the animals or whatever.So the fairy godmother came along.

And then down the road a bit, there was sort of the two ugly old lady two young ladies who were rather, shall we say, not the most attractive people. And then the old lady was a grump.And so the whole point of this was they were supposed to meet the not Cinderella, but the men and the woman to meet them. And the purpose was who would meet the pretty one? So what they did was they got and of course they had to get the dresses and they had to put all their stuff up and so knowing Cinderella, the two ladies, Bumblebee and Bimbo or whatever, were looking forward to this because they were going to have the chance of meet this handsome man.And of course, the lady who was behind it was their mother, who was not the most attractive person. Anyway, so they got ready and they went away up the hill for the big up the hill. And problem was that the younger person wasn't very happy because they said, well, we're not going to give you anything and you're not attractive or whatever. So they said, well, we're just going to stay her behind. Well they felt sorry, rather sorry for her so they looked at a big pumpkin and they said this isn't right, why are we not going to do something for her?So they decided that what they did was they met the pumpkin and they had a magic wand and they did a little oh, yes. Also, they were thinking, we've got to make her better than she was before. So I'm a little lost in this one, but I think they did the Magic Wand and she changed from a raggedy person into a rather attractive looking person. And her name would be Cinderella. I think it says So that's what happened.It's not over yet though. So how are we going to get home? Well they did changed her pumpkin into a big thing where you have people in it and they were riding it.In the meantime they met two old ugly ladies."

But the mom realizes, uh oh, better not have with Cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen. So Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready. And again, I always liked that part of the movie, as I recall, because I liked how the little animals were even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful. So they made us made her beautiful thing.But then the stepmother got where she couldn't go. And so then Cinderella was really crying. As I remember, that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken. And how could they not even let me do anything? And then this very godmother person pops out of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be driven.She gets there and she can dance.

They had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold and it was an immense amount of gold. The people burned oil in the temple and we had to inhale the smoke.Visiting the temple was very beautiful. We saw the people doing exercises or not exercises. They were praying and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down. So I enjoyed watching them. Then we walked along the street and we went to various vendors and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl and that was very fun.Then we went to another temple and it was so tall. The height of the place was very tall, 14,000ft. And I had altitude sickness and I had to have oxygen. And the doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day.

Because by waiting and I don't remember the medical terms, but basically I was out.And they sent my sister home.

And by that time I lost all use of my right leg.And I remember I sort of remember going in and out. I kept thinking, I have to get up, I have to do something.And to me, in my head, I was yelling at the nurse, saying, why are you doing this to me? I didn't come out of it. You'd have to ask my sister, but at least three or four days.And I gather from my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious.And I woke up and was in a blitz, blank out.I came out of the hospital, like, after six days, I think seven days.

And Allison, the one doctor, says, well, you've got a choice. It was on a weekend, which is a bad time, february, Fridays. And he says, you have a choice. You can either go home for the weekend and come back Monday, or you can stay over the weekend.Now, when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything, they're not going to say, oh, I'll stay at the hospital, especially on a weekend.

Not the whole weekend, just overnight, that one day, because originally I was supposed to babysit for them anyway. So just by luck, my daughter said to her husband, Bring your father up too.I don't think mom should be by herself because I had two grandsons, and they were little. So the father came up, and it was a good thing he did, because I started to fall apart. I cried just like that, and I just wouldn't stop crying. And then all of a sudden, I'd sleep. I'd sleep for hours, and I didn't realize it.And then we went the weekend, we went to the doctors, and well, she seems to be fine. She's talking. She's doing this and she's doing that.

But Cinderella starts with she had a wonderful mom and also dad, father and mother, and they were loving and kind, and she was too. And something happened, which a lot of old Disney movies did, showing that one of them passed away and that was her like mother. So her dad, her father met this other woman and decided to he'd like to have him and her get married.And as I always watched it, probably most of us seeing that would go, oh, no, don't be marrying this particular person. But he did. And that person had a couple daughters that she owned. And it's shown that they're all very mean, not only to Cinderella, but even to very all they think about is themselves. And the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money when she gets married.So they realize that Cinderella is just a very beautiful, very she's very pretty and beautiful, but she's inside, she's just a really sweet person who cares about people.I think it's called stepmother. I think that's what it's called. Realizes she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing, working with her. So Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy, wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life, because all that she can do is constantly clean and wash and whatever else she has to do, cook for the other three people. But yet, during that time, cinderella still stays somehow basically happy, at least for the most part, and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them.And so around that time, the the prince, his dad, I can't think what that's called, wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all."

This was in Fort Wayne. He said it's very a lame explanation. He said there was a micro blood clot.It had crossed in my ear, and it was a glitch because I was healthy. I never had any medications. I only took vitamins.Now, I still only take cholesterol only because I had a stroke and 281 milligram two aspirin every night.I will just like to add one moment, because it cannot say it did or it did not, but it did happen in I was in England, 1999."

And in time, she got a stepmother and two stepsisters as well that moved in with her. And they were not very friendly with her over time.Her father must be out of the picture for some reason, because the change of Cinderella and the family changed dramatically, and she became more of a slave than a sister in the girl and the mother. And things got worse and worse as she got older, and one point in time, she got acquainted. Or she learned to live with animals in the home, in the family or in the house and outside the home as well. And they became her friends instead of her stepsisters. And that developed over time.And then the king nearby, or from that decided that the princess, his son, needed to get married, find a bride. So they planned on a ball to meet all the eligible girls in the kingdom. And stepmother and her children. Her daughters decided to go. But leave, not take.Stepmother, Cinderella. And Cinderella had a gown somewhere, I think, from the looks of the one picture, like it was in a closet. Or not a closet, but a trunk someplace. And she got it out and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters, and they ended up tearing it up, and she didn't have anything. And then the animals, mice and the cats and dogs helped her to redo her dress.Stereotype, mother.Whatever.Very Godmother. There we go.

It was going to be a precursor to going back to school to become a principal and administrator. I said, oh. And I said, what do you think of this, Jeff?And he said, I think you should go because it is offered in Lynn, and it is all of the principals, like about four of them are going to put on a presentation and talk about it and then see if you would like to. And I said, oh, okay. Yeah, okay, I will. So I went and I said, oh, wow, I think I will do this. And for two years I had to go.And it was at Gordon College, but they brought it to Lynn because of all of the participants were from Lynn except for one person. So after school at the Ad building, they would come and we would do a class a semester. And it was very interesting. It was School Administration, foundations of Being a Principal, one and two and things like that.

When I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more a therapy for me, I went to the YMCA and got a membership in the Y and hired at the Y a personal trainer who didn't really know anything about Stokes. But she learned. She was very good at studying and learning. The first time that she saw me and I was so stiff that I couldn't move anything, my arm was just if you see it here, your arm is like this and it's clenched fist and everything.And the first time she tried to move my arm, it was like, holy cow, I can't move it. And it wouldn't move. She worked with me. I went twice a week to go with her.And then in addition to that, probably after a while I went started. I'd say, Sharon, take me down to the wine. I was still using my walker. I'd say, let me just take me down the wine. Let me walk around the track with my walker.And I'm sure people probably thought, stupid, here's this old guy walking around very slowly six times around the track for a mile, and it would take me half hour to walk around that lap. But I was determined to do it. And I did it. I did it. And then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane.I still go very slowly.I'm doing it. So I'm going to have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself. And I'm not trying to pat myself on the back. I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have, and I'm sorry for them, they don't. But I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive.I did not lose my drive. I've always been kind of driven anyway. I've always been driven.But I was driven to her to improve and to get better.I'm still doing that and I'm getting there. It will never come to an end, but I will keep working at it. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you? Could be happy or sad or from any time from you were a kid to more recently?Okay."

        "transcript": "Well, I think the best thing that happened was I got a great therapist, and she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction. It's finding what needed to be done and then working with me to get that. But basically went therapy three times a week for several months and then dropped down to a couple of times a week. And until finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us, I'd already done all of them and reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it.But starting I've got a squirrel running across my patio. Never mind, I'll let go of that one. But part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures that we saw with all the drawings of different things. I had the same thing sitting, go in a room, sit in here, look around, and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud until I can figure. Sometimes you know all these words, you know all these items, but you don't not able to pull those words out.And the same thing driving down the street, you look at, say a mailbox, say that word out loud. Mailbox, postop and hedges, whatever you see, make a name, bring a name for that item. And it's something that I've kept along with as long as I've had aphasia. Now when I look at something, I'll say the name of that item just to keep it going. So that's one of the things I do all the time.I don't even think about it. A lot of times it's just something automatic to do.Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at them and then tell me whatever story that you see. The beginning, a middle, and end. Okay. The boy was out playing in the yard, kicking his soccer ball.He kicked his soccer ball a little too hard in the wrong way, and it hit a window and broke.The window, fell through right next to a lamp inside the house, and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor. I'm not sure who this person is, whether it's his father or his neighbor. And then the adult was watching out of the window, looking to see who had thrown that ball and broke his window.Do you think he's looking out angrily, or you think he's just curious? Well, at this point, we don't see his face."

        "transcript": "I think at the beginning, the first thing, they were helping me to stand up, to be able to walk again. They were more into that at the very beginning than other aphasia type stuff. They wanted to make sure I was able to walk again, because one side of my, um, body was starting to have trouble, they said, so they wanted you to start using your hands and your arm and walk around to be able to do all that. At the beginning, they started doing some little tasks for me, like we played cards to see how many cards I can find. Looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that.But we were doing that just here and there. Feeling I was also very sad, very emotional feeling I couldn't even remember who I was. And so getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are, I was more panicked than that kind of stuff. Once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many, two days, I figured out who people were that I remembered. So said, let's go for our therapy now.Let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, we started working on therapy. And they said, you have aphasia. And my talking I couldn't say anything. They were saying, like, do you want something to eat?I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me, like, a cup. Do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me, and I go, yes or no. It took me even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it.If you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out. Little things like that that I didn't remember. Then, once I was able to at least think a little bit more, we started with pictures like that bird and the boy and the banana. And that was our therapy starting, was the fact that being able to say certain words and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name, my kids, and everything else.So, still working on therapy myself. I have a book at home that I still do my homework every day, so still going. The only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write. And I said, But I told myself that I'm going to do it, so I'm not done yet. When it comes to coming up, I'm going to read someday, and I will write, and I will have numbers.At some point, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently, let's see it.Let's."

When I got to the door, I couldn't open the door with the key.And my wife came to the door and she saw me and she took me inside and she put me in a chair and she called 911. And the police came, and the officials came with the vehicle. They checked me out and whatever, and then they put me in an ambulance and took me to the hospital. The hospital is five minutes away from my house, St. Barnabas.And I don't remember what happened after that because they went into the emergency room and all of the things that occurred. I'm really not available because I wasn't aware anymore, period. And when I woke up, I was in a room and I had no speech. Nothing else, as far as I know, was really affected, but I was really laid out. I couldn't do anything, and so forth and so on.And then they treated me there with the doctors and whoever was doing the speech. At the beginning, the speech was very difficult because I had no way of talking. I lost it completely and had a young girl who was working with me. And then when I got out of Kessler, I must have been there like, two, two and a half weeks. I went back to the center three times a week for speech, for physical activities, whatever else.The speech lasted about two and a half months, and my speech was getting better. And she said, I can't do anymore for you. Your speech will you'll be developing better on your own? And that was it."

After three months, my physical health, I mean my physical health was fine, but of course the aphasia kicked in and so it took me probably about seven months to be able to be able to say the right words and that type of thing. So I've had a speech therapist ever since the hestro went back to work, things was slower. Unfortunately, I went back to doing anxiety and stress and then I recently had a seizure in November 25, two days after Thanksgiving. So now I'm getting ready to go on disability for a year for my job, so I can recover, continue, do speech, go to the therapy and the doctor.So it's not a bad thing because I can talk now before I went back from ABCs to one, two, three.

My grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage, and on the weekends, you went to the cottage, and we wouldn't go every weekend, but most of the time we did, especially with summertime, but not schools. We would take that time, and I think that was my favorite places to go.We could fish, we could swim. And it wasn't very deep. There was a lot. Now it was deep in the middle. But right now you didn't really have to swim.You could just walk around a little bit. There were frogs. There was turtles. So, I mean, we got up in the morning, and I think we ate as fast as we could to go outside, and I think you were pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed. And I remember all of those memories on the fact that all the fun things that we were able to do, like, my dad let me have a rowboat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the motor in the back.You were not allowed to go fast. It was like two five fast, so it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the boat. But they let me actually mow it like that. And for me, being old enough not to drive, I could use that paddle boat and stuff like that.I loved to drive. I just thought that was really cool. I'm not sure why now. It was such a big thing, but it was. And I was by myself on the boat.I thought it was something else and all that. We forgot the gas one time. We had to row back, stuff like that. When I was a kid, at night, we had a place to lay down outside, and we would go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty. I think if I have a bad night now, I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage.I still remember that kind of stuff. When I have bad nights to go to bed, I think about that place.

And it became rather troubling to me because because they just didn't do therapy for their brain injured in those years. So there is no therapy. You are able to survive, you're able to just get discharged, hospital, go home, because they just did not do therapy in those years. And over the course of the next 20 years, wife and I found out about from people that had had therapy brain injuries later, that the divorce rate amongst the brain injured approaches 90%, and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five times national average is what they're telling people even 15 years ago.And so I wanted to share that with patients at RHI just to give them hope that recovery is possible. But it just takes a long time. And in four, when I started there at RHI, I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families up a year to year and a half recovery, year to year and a half recovery, year to year, and after recovery, hey, you don't stop recovering. The rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty radically after a year to year and a half, but you never stopped recovering. In the 84 incident, I had a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip, and it was just something that I accepted, and it was like a function without it no big deal, but to stick a pin there wouldn't feel it, no big deal.And then it was probably, I believe, five years ago, I think it was 925 years after the 84 incident, I was in the in the bedroom putting on my socks one morning, and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for 25 years. So what I'm telling you, Ashley, is that the recovery may slow down, like I say, and mathematically describes asymptotic but still slow down significantly. It but still you never stop recovering. You just don't stop recovering. You don't.I'm done preaching."

So that's why proofreading reading and all that, all the way through college, I would help all of the students, because this was easy to me, because I got it way back when. It's like, oh, yeah, I can look at your term, and it's like, Wrong. Get it, fix it.It's okay. But it was just simple to me. But for them, it was difficult. Or like, I think when I was a nurse and I was in my last year, one of my teachers, she gave us a term paper, and it was supposed to be, like, ten pages, and it was supposed to cover this, this and all these things, right? And I can't tell you exactly what it is at this moment, but I know when she was doing meeting with everybody, she says, Ten years?You're the only one that's getting 100. And I thought, okay, that's a good thing, because she says, you covered everything. And it's like, well, she says, when did you write it? And I says, Two days ago. But I had it in my head, which I always wrote.That's how I would write, though. It was always here. But now putting it down, that I could just go, and there it be.So that's kind of a cool thing. But the one thing she did say is that you will never be an Er nurse because you think you'll have it all perfect, which is how it is. It still is in my head. I can't do it quick because I might make a mistake, and I wouldn't want to have a mistake, so therefore, I would never put myself in that position. She was absolutely right too.She says, the way you write, I could tell that you will never be an Er person. I was like, no, I've had plenty of emergency things, but that's usable."

So the little girl could have been actually seen the dog chasing the cat.But anyway, she sees the cat as up there and would like to have it come down. She was probably riding a tricycle, so probably her father put the ladder up on the limb limb, the limb, and went up there and the ladder fell. So it's pretty high up and the cat's up there and the man is way up high. He doesn't have a ladder. And by the looks of it, actually his daughter is more interested in a cat than her father.It's a man perhaps, and there's a bird in the tree also, but I don't think they're involved and I don't think they are frank the cat or anything like that. So the firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going to first take the father down and then they're going to get the cat and the little girl will be happy.

But I know the fairy godmother said that she had to be home by midnight and she was having such a wonderful time and all of a sudden she realized she better go. And she was in the pumpkin, right? So she goes into the pumpkin, but while she was getting out of there, she lost one of her shoes. And the prince, you see, he was looking for a wife and queen for his castle anyways, so he went away and oh, I think really the ugly sisters, they didn't realize that it was her because she usually is in wrecks.But anyway, she goes home, she gets into her old clothes and of course, the sisters, the stepsisters try to remember they want to fit in that shoe because then the prince will think it's her or him. And they have big feet and eventually in the background is Cinderella and someone checks the foot. They said, oh, she didn't have to do that. But she did.

I think that's about right and I think last thing I'm saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit so I was thinking about that and praying about that and that's the last thing I can tell you. We were going to the hospital and she was asking me a lot of questions as she was driving and I was doing the best I could but I couldn't really explain very well it so was a pretty wow, pretty intense thing that happened."

So then Cinderella leaves, sees, oh, no, it's almost midnight, so she has to suddenly run. He's thinking, Wait, come back, come back.And as she's running down her slipper grass slipper, they call it, or whatever, falls, and she has to keep running. So then I think the pictures showed that she's back home, and she's just happy that she got to do something.And then they find out that, oh, boy, my brain, that there was a slipper, or they're going to find who was that woman who actually would, of course, have been Cinderella. And so they go to every unmarried young woman, and none of them it doesn't fit right with any of them with the slipper. I can't talk with the slipper. And it does for Cinderella.She becomes married, and I think I missed one thing in there. It seems like the mom ends up breaking that or something first. I don't remember that. But anyway, they find the other one, like I say, and that fits. It's the only one that fits.Right. And it's obviously she's the one. Then it shows that they get married and they're happily ever after. I think that's it.Can you tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?Yeah, you open up each of the each of the like sorry. Each of the like jellies. Excuse me. Let me start over again. Peanut butters and jelly.Oh, wait a minute. I'm saying that backwards. Peanut butters. Oh, yeah. Okay.First I have to get out. I can't think what to call it. What I would made hot. Take probably two of those. And then get peanut butter and go inside it.Take one and put it around, probably both, maybe. And then get the jelly put around there.

We called them sores because that's what he called them, was sores. And I put a sore in the basket of toys, and I put a sore on my keyboard and in my refrigerator and in my freezer.And it was just and so I would make these little videos, and I would tell him, you're going to have to come and see Granny and help me with these sores. They're out of control. They're into my computer, and they're going to mess up my work, and they're into my freezer, and I'm not going to be able to cook because they're messing with all this food and everything. He thought those little people, little videos, maybe two minutes long each, he thought those were hilarious. And he would watch them over and over and over and over again because that's what little kids do when they like a video they do 100 times.And then his baby brother came along and think of there so two years difference. Yeah, two years. And so the baby, he's just as cute as he can be. So he's right about almost two. And so much difference between the two and their personalities.But the first one, he's super smart. He's also very manipulative.He works that cuteness angle. And then the second one, he was a lot more agreeable. He was plenty smart, but I could tell not to the level his brother is. He didn't get stuck quite as quickly. It's like you had to work with him a while, but then you get in, he was fine.I think he just likes to analyze, maybe more, just to think things through. So the second one, just super long eyelashes any girl would love to have. And this is just as cute as he can be. And I went to go see them last Thanksgiving, I think it was, or Christmas. It was last Christmas.I went to go see them Christmas, and I FaceTime with them a lot. And so the older one, he's thrilled to see me, and he just runs to me and says, granny wants me to pick him up and everything. But the baby, even though he'd seen my face a lot on the screen. And of course, I'd seen him in person too, but not real often. It took him a minute.He had to watch his older brother, like, I guess it's okay to go sit near her. It was like it seemed like at some point a light switched on with him, and he was like, she's fine. So I've then had them both on my lap, and for about an hour or two, I was enjoying celebrity status. Just cool. I've always heard how much fun grandbabies are.Head. Oh my gosh, instant celebrity is so much fun. That's probably about the best things ever happened to me."

They also tell a story. Take a second to look at them, and whenever you're ready, tell me the story you see with a beginning, middle and an end.Oh, I forgot beginning and the end last time. Okay. The beginning is that the little kid, I think it's a boy, is going off to school. And mom tries to hand him an umbrella. And he says, mom, I don't need an umbrella.I'm a big kid. I don't need umbrella. It's not going to rain. I'll walk. I'll be okay.So he waves goodbye to the mom. He's got his backpack on, heads for school, tells mom goodbye, and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't want to take with him. So he starts walking off to school and there's some raindrops coming down. Not a lot, but just a few raindrops here and there. And he looks up the sky and he's like, oh, no, what did I do?I didn't bring the umbrella. So he said, I think I'll go home and get the umbrella. And he turns around and it's raining harder now. The wind's kind of blowing because the rain is coming at an angle. And it's quite a bit rain because as he runs, he's splashing, so there's enough rain that's making splices.And he's kind of holding his hand up over his head as though he's going to be able to stop the water off his head. But he runs home and you can say the mom is a little perturbed because he wouldn't take the umbrella. So there he is, all wet, head to toe, wet, dripping wet. And the mom just kind of looks at him like, you should listen to what I said. He said, okay, so give me the umbrella.So she gives him umbrella and he heads back to school. And it's still raining, still raining pretty hard, coming down at an angle, even more of an angle than it was. So it must be blowing pretty hard, about a 45 degree angle. And he's walking guys backpack and he's walking off to school. And it the moral of the story is listen to your mom.She knows best. The end."

He's like, I'm here on this ranch and I'm happy, so you all can worry about all you want, but I might come down. So the little girl says, daddy, daddy, daddy.And she's little girl is probably young and old. She's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle. She's got pigtails and little black sandals.Like I said, she's riding a tricycle. The cat won't come down. So apparently the dad must have gone up in the tree to get the cat down and he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there and something happened. I'm going to guess maybe the dog that's barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something, but something hit the ladder and knocked it down. The dad stuck in the tree and I don't know who called the fire department, unless he has cell phone.Maybe it's, maybe, I don't know. He must have cell phone. He called the fire department and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters carrying their ladder and they're running over to get the man down out of the tree. Meanwhile, the dog is barking up the tree.I don't think he's mad. He's just barking up the tree because he wants the guy to come down or something. So the firemen are on their way. They've got their ladder truck sitting out on the street.There's a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away and yeah, that's pretty much it. It's a big tree.

I can't think what it's called.Beautiful place. Sorry. Somebody's walking back here and I'm getting this.Okay.

So the so it's made by decree that they should have a they should have this like okay, this like this like ball, wherein the ball every it girl that is not married has to come there and then they'll be able to figure out who's the best one that he should marry.So then they showed in the picture, if I remember right, his her new mom seeing, reading, oh good, we all get to go to the ball.

Instead of breaking this way, it broke that way, and it couldn't be fixed.They did break part of my arm, okay, but there was so much damage to the lower course that this didn't work. I mean, it couldn't be used. So I ended up spending the rest of my life in a full cask. It cannot be fixed at all. Like I said, the leg and the knee are it.So I was probably out for, I don't know, at least four weeks, five weeks then, even though I didn't know what the heck was going on.So they worked on it, they did some facts on it. After about seven no, six weeks. Seven weeks.They took me out of that, working on Wally, working on my things that were supposed to they were trying to fix okay, speech, whatever. Then for the next four months, four months they did some more work. I mean, I didn't even but after that, by the middle, they went six weeks, then they went another I don't know, four weeks. I knew what was going on, but I might as well have been out of it. And my sister and my brother said that my speech started coming to bit together at that point.But from August no, from October, September, October, from October on, from October till middle of January, they started doing trying to adjust my language, trying to adjust everything."

        "transcript": "Okay, so it was on a Friday. It was June 10, 2011. I had just finished the first day of a conference of airway management, and it was time to go to have dinner. So my partner and I went downstairs, and we were out of the hotel for approximately maybe 1 minute. And I did not notice what was happening, but she saw me dropping my purse, and then she stayed behind, and she yelled to me, jenny, you dropped your purse.So I turned around, and again, I didn't notice anything. But when she saw me, she was like, oh, my God, something's really wrong. According to her, my face was already distorted.In retrospect, I realized that I was not able to speak because she tried to tell me, we need to go back. And I guess saying no, but that's all I was in. Okay, so eventually, let's see. All right. I started noticing things that were kind of out of whack.For example, at some point, I was really smiling on this side, and I felt the emotion of kind of, like, bursting out into laughing. But then on this side, then I was feeling, like, very sad, and I could feel the emotion, and it's like, what's going on? And then all of a sudden, I noticed that my eyes were deviated to the left, which, in retrospect, I know that when you have a brain lesion, the eyes deviate the left or to the right, depending where the lesion is. Anyway, so finally, they went ahead and took me to the hotel. Once again, eva.My partner went ahead and recruited some people that ushered me back to the hotel. And there was a medical conference there that I was taking. So it's a whole bunch of doctors there. So one doctor came out, and then he saw me. She's got a stroke and then proceeded to elevate my neck.And that was the most painful experience I have ever, ever had. And then we waited for the ambulance to get by I mean, to come in, and they did my bottles. The hospital was about five blocks away from where the stroke happened, and they were able to start TPA, which is TPA. Sorry, which is an anti clotting medicine. And between that and homeopathy, that was money saving grace."

And I said, oh, my God, I want to do this.So I went to a special school in Denham to teach me how to drive. It took me a long time to do that. So when my instructor said to me, I think you can do it, I said, Great. Let's do it. So I went to the registry, got into an office with a state trooper and he looks at me and he says, Mr.Flyn, where are you going? I says, Well, I'm hoping to get my license. He says, I think not. I says, why is that? Because you haven't filled up all that information.I says, yeah, I understand that, but I can't write. I can't communicate that way. He says, not my problem. That's your problem. I says, yeah, and I want to tell you one more thing too, by the way, you're a bastard.He said, what did you say? I says, Let me do that one more time for you. I was so upset about that. So state trooper looked at me and says, okay, Mr. Bowman, he's a smack.I want you to get in this car and let's see if you can really drive. I don't care about anything else. Let's see if you can drive. I said okay. I thought for sure I was going to have another stroke.But at the end of that test, this group looked at me and says, all right, Mr. Flint, you made it. But understand one thing you just barely made it. I says, I don't care. I made it.And then he said to me, which I thought was very special to me, he says, I want you to go with me to go to Spalding because you have that monthly meeting. Because I need to know for what it's like for other people to have strokes. Being your license getting a license is one thing. Being a plane is another thing. I says you're right.So I learned something.So I got my license. And driving now is I never hardly do it at night very much well, because I'm getting old in my eyes, stuff like that.

Wonderful. I know. Thankfully, that's never happened to me. Never did that to my mom.Yeah. Whether that's the parent or just the owner of the house, probably not very happy. I know.

And I would say his mother is saying you should take an umbrella. And I'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella, and so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella.

They gave me a tracheotomy, what turned out to be scar tissue and vocal cords, changed my voice pretty radically. Where my wife had told me, she said that you had the sexiest telephone voice I've ever heard. So Ashley there. It was the one thing she liked about me.And that was that was it was extraordinarily troubling because like I said, I didn't know where I was. When people recognized it recognized saying, when is what's going to come back? And I was really troubling to me. Really troubling.That was one of the first of my memories."

There's a man up on the branch of the tree, and the dog is probably barking at him. And there's another tree.There's a bird looks like it's singing, and there's a ladder on the ground. Possibly the ladder was used by the man. And he looks kind of not he looks discouraged. And so it's probably his ladder that fell. And so he's just kind of sitting there, taking all that in with the environment on the way.Looks like it's going to be a happy ending."

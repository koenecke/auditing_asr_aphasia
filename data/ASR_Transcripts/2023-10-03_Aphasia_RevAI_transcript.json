And so through, um, whatever her name is, um, Cinderella goes to, goes to the ball, and she, uh, meets the, the Prince. Um, and they seem to hit out, have a good time. Uh, part of the story, she's told that she has to leave by midnight. And, um, as they're having a good time, she realizes that, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:18    Uh,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:21    The clock starts to chime and she realizes that it, she has to leave because everything is going to be changed back to the way her, her life is. And so as she is leaving from the ball, uh, she leaves a, uh, slipper, a glass slipper, depends on which story you listen to, um, that is left at the, the ball. And so she leaves and the prince doesn't know who she, this, this girl is, and all he has is this, uh, shoe. So now comes to a point of trying to find out who this girl was, and hopefully by checking this, the shoe, if it fits, um, they had an e edict from the king that all the women are to be checked to see who this shoe will match. Um, so as, uh, Cinderella and her stepsisters are hoping that they'll be able to see the, uh, check the, the, the slipper, uh, the stepmother doesn't want Cinderella to have that chance. Um, so the stepmother step sisters tried to hear, fit the, uh, slipper, and it doesn't. And, uh, as things change, uh, Cinderella gets a chance to, uh, have a slipper to see if it will fit. And through the help of the, her ferry or whoever the, the, the, the lady that is helping Cinderella, um, she has the chance to check the Prince, check the, uh, shoe. \n"

I don't even remember anything about it, but, um, it was like 10 days they finally got me in there to, um, I finally started. I mean, I could actually talk or anything like that. Um, but I had to remember how to remember everything and re everything has gone back. I mean, everything about, um, a, B, C, all that kind of stuff like that. Everybody's name, everybody, the computer on there, the the coke sitting there, everything the wrong about it, you have nothing about it. You had to remember everything about it. So, um, we, um, went to, I had like 30, 30 days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing, mostly to see what it was first. Um, and then um, we went to, um, after that, that's when we started to talk into, um, getting the thing, make sure I don't forget something 10 years before, um, <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    But we did start like, um, a, B, C 1, 2, 3 or something like that with my mom started to um, it's in um, um, hooks. I went there, there was someone, we gotta talk over there and she talked to me all the time about, remember how you start about everything, getting all a, B, c 1, 2, 3 and stuff like that. Um, and it took a long time. It was about a year to start over that and I've gone down, it was Monday to Friday, now it's down Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks. Just try to talk a little better on that. 'cause I mean, at this time I could talk a little better, but it just hard to get back everything outta there. So that helped different things about it for those six weeks, how you're trying to the computer, trying to try to write on there, trying to do something about it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:16    Got a little better there and that's how they tried to, after that they started IU and that's when they, um, started with noun, verb, preposition, all those kind of things like that. Um, there's so much you couldn't remember anything about it. Um, but it's, you just take your time trying to maybe me and my mom, my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything. Still I can't, but you get to rewrite things about it. After you do that, you do very good about those things, but then you forgot about the other things you did back <laugh>. So it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time. So you just gotta keep everything, keep  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk. Mostly taking my time. So if I talk too much, people have no idea what I'm doing and they talk to me real quick. And this is kind of weird because if one person talk to me kills me, if there's three people I can understand, other people I can understand what it's, but, so it takes time how I'm getting around everything. So, um, so it's just, it keeps going every year and still like that, just getting a little better. Um, I don't know how long I can go, but it's just, it seems like I'm still doing something with it. So, um, and it keeps going every time. So, so I try to ride every day, all kinds of stuff I can, but, um, I just, my mom's very helping that and my sisters have helped a little bit there too if they needed to, something like that. But, um, I have my brothers. \n"

Now, Cinderella was a, uh, Cinderella was, I guess, I think there was a, I think that, uh, Cinderella was actually, had to work for the, uh, the kind of evil sisters, and they weren't very nice to her. They made her do the laundry. Uh, obviously in the story here, all the, uh, all the animals love Cinderella because they're all in, they're all around whenever she has, and they, apparently, they, they like her a lot 'cause all that little animals are around when she's doing her things. Um, so the, uh, the, um, the, the king had a son. He was looking for a, uh, look for bride for his, his son, and didn't say that right? Did I? Yeah, he was looking for a ride for his son. And, uh, uh, they, they were, he, they were gonna have a ball so they could all come and, and, uh, see who, who, she would pick all the ladies and young ladies in the kingdom.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:26    And, uh, she was looking out the window in this one picture. She was looking out the window, kind of dreaming about it, but, um, she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball. So, um, they'll, Dell went to the ball and while they, uh, uh, you, I don't remember exactly how it was, but she ended up, I guess the, the Fair Godmother came while she was at, was, well, they were at the ball and the Fair Godmother took, uh, told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that she would take the ball in, was a, a pumpkin carriage. And, uh, take him to the ball. And, uh, I remember this one picture there that seemed to be a little weird, that horses were sitting on their hind legs, <laugh> with their kind of, with their feet up something, you know, they weren't, they weren't standing there on four legs. Uh, it was kind of weird. And, um, so, uh, the fairy grandmother took her to the ball and, uh, she got the ball and, uh, went in and nobody knew this, knew who it was, uh, because she was so, so  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Beautiful. Nobody knew who she was. And they had the ball and the, and the prince, the prince liked her. And, um, and then the, um, the, the, uh, times went off and the clock and big clock, big band or whatever. And, uh, and, and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before her, back home before midnight, and it was after midnight. And, uh, so she got up, she ran out and, uh, her stepper fell off and she went on. She got home, uh, with that slipper. And then, uh, the, uh, the prince started looking for whoever it was that had this, the slipper. And he was trying use the, trying around everybody in. \n"

Um, I went to bed on a Monday night after work, and, uh, just like the other night, I expected I was gonna sleep and get up and go to work the next day. Um, about, uh, one or two in the morning, uh, I had to go to the bathroom and I was struggling to get the covers off. I was laying on my left side, so I trying to get the covers off with the right, and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were. And, uh, that was my first signs. Something was wrong. I, at first I thought, 'cause I had the two cats and I thought they were laying on the covers or something, but, uh, they, I, you know, the room was dark and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my mind. And finally they came off and then I, um, started to take some steps.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    The bathroom was the next room over, and I was, um, finding that I was exhausted and I decided I would just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. Uh, I don't know why I didn't think to just get back in the bed, but I just laid on the floor. Uh, I laid there for about 30 minutes. Um, my Garmin told me what was going on the timeline, and, uh, so when I got back up, I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom, so I didn't just crawl back in the bed. And, uh, then about, um, I was awake asleep back and forth till about eight o'clock and I was trying to figure out something's wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major. And I was trying to decide to probably something wrong with my brain or my heart.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:56    And, um, I didn't want to go to the emergency room and there'd be nothing wrong. Uh, but I called, uh, a guy from work. I used my phone and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number, so I want to leave him a voicemail message. And I was surprised to hear him answer. And that's when he told me, you called my cell number. So I worked for a very difficult company to work for, and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on. So I kind of jokingly told him something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified. I wouldn't be in that day. And I said, uh, pass the word on. My brain's not working right today, I won't be in. And so he just chuckled and said, well, okay, I'll pass that on. And then  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    I called a friend and, uh, told him what was going on. And, uh, then between two of us, uh, we decided, um, well, my, my idea, I won't call him a half hour. If you don't hear from me, call me. If you can't reach me, call for help. So, uh, half hour later I called him and, uh, I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital. So I did. My neighbor next door came and got me. And, um, we went to the hospital. I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one. We got, uh, four hospitals to choose from. So I don't know why or remember why we went to that one. But, um, she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago. \n"

And I worked hard at it for a long time and I took, got kind of afterwards. I've kind of gotten a little slow about it, or not slow, but you know, just haven't done it as diligently as I used to. But, uh, for the first months after the stroke, I was, I worked hard at it trying to pull those pictures back. And I found that, you know, it, it's like learning in school again. Grade school, you look at a word and you learn that word and oh, that's that word. And it comes back and it stays back with aphasia. It doesn't stay there. <laugh>. It's, it's more like having a, an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled. You know, it's like, okay, I know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be. It's over there instead. You know, that type of thing. So,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:23    So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life to be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:39    Happy? I think when my grandson was born, he was a joy to be with and, uh, I got to spend a lot of time with him when he was little as an infant and, uh, watching him grow and just, that was special. He's 10 now and he's doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as I liked then, and he's off doing other things. So  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:17    Here are some more pictures that also tell a story. Take a second to look at them and then whenever you are ready, tell me the story that you see with the beginning and middle and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:30    Okay. Now first of all, these, uh, pictures are under the last four, uh, stories, so I can't see what's there.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:41    <laugh>, there are two ways to fix that. Um, we can click and drag the, um, our, like windows or you can minimize it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:52    Alright, got it. Alright. Alright, let's do this. There we go. Down below it now. Okay, boy's out kicking the soccer ball, he kicked it, got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad, but, uh, window came through the yard and, uh, uh, I'd say his dad saw it opened, looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:34    Here's some more pictures. They also tell a story, so take a second to look at all of them. And whenever you are ready, tell me the story. You see, it's a beginning, a middle, and an end.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:47    Okay. In the beginning, mom sent little boy out to go to school. She had, he had a backpack. \n"

So, um, I'm not sure why he's, they sent 'em that way, but anyway, um, whoever gave it said, that'd be nice, we'll give it to you and stuff like that. They'll keep it and stuff. It'll make it good for you too. But then the aunt was very nice. She made her pretty bad. She had to go work outside and she everything else and get, she certain the dirt and all that stuff. But her cousins were very nice. They gotta do whatever they wanted and they're kind of in the butt. Um, but um, so that's how it was for all the time. She tried to be nice, but they were still not very nice.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    But, um, the one time they were gonna have, they were, I guess they do for the sometime of the year, they get to see everybody. So they went to, um, see if this would be, see their, their aunt took the two girls to make sure they were gonna find their, one of the, the boy, the great boy is one of those that comes there. Um, so they're gonna go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that. But their cousin didn't know she was supposed to be there. But a, um, uh, what would you say would be, um, not a ghost or something, I don't know, but they had one that would bring on the way that's not normal, how the, um, people and still can, it's totally different how they flew in here. Got 'em. But they got a hold her and got her some different clothes and stuff like that so she could go in that way.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    Um, so she got to go in that place and, um, went to see there that night, got up, she could go, um, sing and play or was out there, got some people and that's where they saw the big, um, it's one of the, I think he's, um, I don't know if he is the king or he might be just the new king coming there. He was out there, he was with her for a while, but then she had to leave and he was worried what happened to her. But, um, she left and he was worried about that. But she did drop one of her, um, shoes. So he had that. So they went back. She was going back her place where she was just not very happy and, and working and all that kind of stuff. But, um, her cousins of course tried it, told that it was her shoes and they put 'em on there and her feet are huge, so it wasn't gonna work on that. But then, um, while they're there, they did, he did bring 'em over to her and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoe so he knew what it was. So he took her back and went, is a great, or the best thing you could ever do. She went back. She's, she's like queen now. So, best thing that came on that way. So Enough.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:35    Um, I was hoping you could tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:46    Okay.

He kicks it, uh, hard, kicks it really hard, raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air. And then it goes to, uh, it, uh, then you see the, uh, the cycle ball travels through the air and hits a window. Uh, there's shutters on the window. Uh, it's a, it's a nice size picture, not a picture window, a good one, good s size window. And, uh, there's some bushes outside the window. Um, and they, the, the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp, knocks the lamp off the, off, out of, knocks the lamp off the table, but it knocks the lamp over. And, uh, no, uh, so it knocks the lamp over and, and comes through the window. Um, the guy's sitting there probably watching TV or something, but, uh, he, uh, gets up, picks up the soccer ball, walks over to the window, and, uh, you know, the, the window, I think we talked about this last time, the window is there. The, uh, the lamp where the, where the, where the, um, s Jack Ball came through. The window is not there anymore. It's the lamp is gone. The curtains are, are a little bit different.

I am sure he is probably going to find out, and he's probably going to, uh, make somebody's pay for the window. \n"

Uh, maybe a size of a quarter that where it had bled into my brain, but it stopped bleeding, it stopped, and everything was going okay. It stopped, and there wasn't really much damage. So, um, so Dr. Mc Farge then said, uh, we can, we can fix that pretty easily. Well take you, put you in hospital, take four or five days, I have to cut into your, cut into your skull, and uh, and go in there and we'll take that, fix that well actually seal it off.

That had all happened on April Fool's Day on April 1st of, uh, 2015. And, uh, so I went in for the surgery on, uh, on, uh, may the sixth of that year, 2015. And, uh, little did I know I wasn't gonna come home for quite a while. I wouldn't be home for another six months. And in the meantime, excuse the, uh, French, the shit hit the fan and it did big time. I'm sorry, did I, I I don't mean to, uh, offend you. Okay. So, uh, that was, that was, that was, that was my second stroke. And, uh, did I That was, that, that was, well, okay.

Uh, the problem was that when I went back, when, when I was in recovery from that surgery, I was in recovery and, uh, I ignored it again. Can, um, sorry. That make, make sure it's not No, it's <inaudible>. Um, so, uh, when I a time or two go, it'll go away. I'm sorry. \n"

        "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:00    So I came back home and, uh, had breakfast when I got back from, uh, exercise. And then I normally would go to work and I couldn't go to work. And I told Patty that I needed to go to the see my doctor. And basically at that time, the only doctor I was seeing was a heart colon, the oncologist or heart doctor. And she talked me instead to go to the emergency room, went to the emergency room, and they discovered that I'd had a stroke. And so they put me in the hospital and, uh, I was there three days. They were trying to, basically my heart was outta rhythm and, uh, beating too fast and lots of different things. So they spent three days basically just dealing with that heart issue, getting it stabilized, and then three more days, basically discovering that, uh, I'd had a, a stroke and aphasia. And, uh, then I was went home after the, I'm trying to think what day of the week it was. Wednesday. Wednesday I went home and, uh, Thursday I drove back to the Drove then, because I could drive, I could do everything I needed to do except talk <laugh>. So I went to make an appointment with the, uh, uh, speech therapy at that point. And that's where it started.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:59    Do you mind telling me a little bit about that? Like your recovery? So what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke?  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:09    Well, it started out with something simple because basically I could look at, at anything, know what it was, but I couldn't pull the words out. And so we started with a simple thing, like in the room, for example, looking around the room, looking at each object in the room, naming it, trying to find the, the word and say the word out loud, you know? So that's where it first started and it built from there, you know, just, and some of the things we saw looked at just a few minutes ago, you know, like with the pictures, you know, look at the picture, name the picture. And over time that gradually got better and better. But, uh, that's where I think the start with the therapy was. And then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing, uh, taking a paper and pencil and writing, I couldn't spell properly anymore.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:16    And, you know, that was something I had to work at. So I found that with my, uh, keyboard, I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with a note would here, you know, the same thing. It, it has a spell checker and a spell, uh, not, I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily a checker, but it starts out, you know, if you start the first few characters of a word, it gives you several different words that work. So that sometimes helped a lot as well writing. So, uh, you know, I've done a lot of that. \n"

Um, do you remember your stroke?  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:51    All I remember about the stroke is the fact that I woke up one morning with a splitting headache and it was so bad that, uh, I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had. Um, took a couple aspirin. I went to, uh, outside and picked up the mail. My, not the mail, but my newspaper went back to have breakfast. And, uh, as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast, I tried to read, but I could not make, read the paper properly. The blocks of words were just that they were blocks and some of it, they weren't all together. It's like I was seeing part of the words, or part of the blocks of words, not the whole words. So I left the newspaper that morning and didn't, uh, read it and finished getting ready, went to work, and, uh, drove to work.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    And on the way to work, I, uh, noticed that on the dashboard of the car, again, parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard and parts of it. I couldn't see. I couldn't see all the words, all that, but I was able to drive properly and, uh, drove to work, got to work. And when I tried to got to work, I tried to log into my computer and I didn't know how. I think that's probably the best thing I could say about that. I didn't know how to log in. I didn't know my username, I didn't know my password, anything. And I just got a total blank with that. So, uh, I worked at it for a while and couldn't, couldn't do anything. So I finally went to my boss and said, Hey, I've got a problem. I've got a headache, and, uh, I just can't, can't log in.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:01    And, uh, I was asked, just take time and find a place to rest and relax and come back a little while and try again. So I just sat in the dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again, and I couldn't make it. So I finally said, I, I can't, uh, do it. I need to go home. So I went home, went to bed. Uh, when I got home, I took a couple more aspirin, went to bed, and spent most of the day in bed and I slept. And then when I got up in the afternoon, I was able to, uh, read, I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that, but it still was problems. And, um, I do Sudoku, that puzzle. \n"

Um, Sharon had gone to get her, uh, haircut about 25 miles away, and I was working here at the house. I was, uh, I was, I was, I've been working on, uh, on doing some carpenter work in the house. And, uh, I started to feel, um, I started to feel kind of numb in my right hand. Um, I didn't feel too bad, but I knew from what people had told me, or I'd heard that many times the, one of the signs of a stroke as a numbness. In fact, I remember I was, uh, a fellow that I used to work with, had a stroke at work, and I remember going through that and, uh, kind of recognized from that, how it looked.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    Um, so I, I, I, I knew what was going on. I knew I was having a stroke, um, against my, well, I probably sh I shouldn't have done it, but I, I called Sharon and I said, uh, you probably need to come home. Um, I'm gonna head, I'm gonna go to the hospital. I don't feel right, you know, I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm, I better just come on home. And, uh, I said, I'm, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna head to the hospital, just come on down to the emergency room when to get here. So I, I did, I went out and I got my truck, and I headed for the, went to the hospital, which isn't very far away. It's about six or eight blocks away from here. And, um, I drove to the hospital and, uh, dove into the emergency room parking, and, uh, walked into the, uh, I walked into the hospital and I said, I'm, I'm, I think I'm having a stroke. And they, you know, didn't waste any time. Said, okay, somebody, come on, come back. We'll, we're gonna take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They, they took me, put me in one of the examination rooms, and, um, they started to examine me, uh, Sharon, uh, she, it was about a half hour away, so she got there after this had started that the ex, uh, questions, I think I, I think I, they had already taken me to, uh, to get a CT  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Scan or whatever it was, uh, well before she got there. So they, they, when, when, when she got there, I was already had gone into, uh, to get a scan. And, um, so when they had, when I was done with that, they took me, uh, uh, back into the, waiting back into the room where I was, the treatment room, whatever you call it, at, at the, in the emergency room. And, uh, I, I remember pretty well that, uh, you know, Sharon was there and, and, uh, I remembered I knew what was going on. Uh, I, that I was, that I had a stroke, but it felt like it was probably, it wasn't getting any worse, it was just stroke. Uh, so I wasn't too worried about it. \n"

And when he got done talking with me and everything, and he looked at me, he says, you had a stroke? He says, it wasn't a big one, but he says you had a stroke. So that's how I knew I had a stroke. <laugh>, it was really, really weird. But, uh, I, I forgot so many things. Like in the morning, every morning after I got my breakfast ready, I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper and I couldn't read it. I looked at it and I couldn't get the words. I could. I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words. And I, what I did get to read, I didn't understand.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:00    So I tried for a couple of days and I thought, the heck with this, I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days, I'm sitting there and I thought, you are gonna learn to read that paper. I started reading. Now I read a paper and it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning when I got up after I, you know, into the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there and I'd think my daughter's family, there's four people in the family. There's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name, but I couldn't get his name out. And the two boys, and I would just close my eyes and visualize it, and gradually, all of a sudden I'd see their names and gradually it would come. Then I went with my oldest son, with his family.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    It was tiring. And I did that at night too. When I went to bed before I went to sleep, I worked with one family at a time, and then my sisters and my brother and all that. And it was a long time, but it, it worked. It really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day, I says, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me. I says, I am so tired. And I says, I don't do anything. She says, mom, you are doing a whole lot. I says, such as what? I says, all I'm doing is, uh, thinking about this one, I'm thinking about, well, that's it. She says, you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself, and you don't realize it said. But, um, it all came. It's just now, I, I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out and that, and when  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    I write, it's getting better. Sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything, and all of a sudden I look at it and I thought, no, that's not that word. <laugh>. And the first time I saw that was when I made my first, uh, when I was going to the store, my little shopping, thankfully I needed, uh, mayonnaise, <laugh>. So I'm writing and writing. I get to the store, and I came to that word. I couldn't figure out what it was. The, it wasn't even making any kind of sense, and I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping, I would keep going back at it and back. Now I have to think, what was I gonna do with this? Then I knew what it was. It would come, I'd forget it again, but then it, but that's the way it goes. I know everything. But, um, I still have to, I forget a lot of things, but everybody's. \n"

And, uh, she met this, uh, guy when she was, uh, 13 or 14 years old in her school. And, uh, you know, when I first met him, I'm just seeing this skinny teenager with acne and I'm thinking he's just full of hormones. He is like, this is the last thing I want around my daughter. I got enough trouble with her. And, uh, well anyway, uh, they eventually got married and then, uh, but she was determined. She didn't want any kids. She was just sure she would screw 'em up. And, uh, it is just too hard. And so me and my husband, we'll just, you know, we'll just see the world. And they did, they did a lot of traveling and everything.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:19    And, um, and I had just, and I have a son too, but he didn't seem to have any, uh, interest in getting married or having kids or anything. And so I just thought, you know, I may never have any grandbaby, but I sure would love him. But if not, then okay. So I just worked in the church nursery and, and kind of helped get my baby fixed there. And, uh, then, uh, my son-in-law and daughter moved to Florida. And, um, by this time, you know, I realized, uh, through some different experiences that he loved her and was very protective of her. And I was always super protective of my kids. Uh, uh, and I realized he was just as protective of her, if not more so than I ever was. And so I thought he's gonna cart her off to Florida and I don't want her to be so far, but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for her. And, uh, so, um, then I don't remember how long they'd been there, maybe a year or so, and, uh, she, uh, she came back to town and a relative on his side had a baby and she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby. And she just, I remember I took a picture of her with that baby and I thought she just looked so natural with that baby. Like, she's held them all  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Her life. And, uh, she told me, I really want one now. And so it took maybe another year or two 'cause she was losing babies. She lost, uh, two or three. And, um, then when she had this one, um, and maybe about six months in, uh, I'm in Indiana and she's in Florida, and I'm nesting, and then my house is reasonably clean anyway, but, um, but I cleaned my whole living room once and I just said, you know, it, it had been recently remodeled. Uh, and so there wasn't a lot of junk in there, but I started, uh, pulling, uh, items out and going through them and I, uh, cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows and just, you know, every crevice I cleaned in that living room. \n"

They looked like they were dangerous people. And the cat looked like it was somebody that, the cat was like a, a funny looking cat too on this side. There was like a little girl. And, um, she was very nice looking. And, uh, I'm not sure who this guy's supposed to be. He's, he's a, a man. He, he's got like a, a beard, not a beard, but what would you call that?

She probably works at the, at the somebody's house. And she probably had to, like, her job was to like, um, clean and she was, she was trying to help out. She probably wasn't rich. Um, but I think they were looking, um, the ma the major part of the story, I think I'm gonna, I'm going to, I'm gonna continue with this, is that, um, they were looking for a, um, for a young, for a young, a young man, handsome man who was gonna get married. Uh, and they were, and he was, he was probably in the, in the, uh, call it that place again. I said it right, but now I've forgotten what to call it.

Um, maybe it was her, maybe it was, um, the mother or something, but she had, her two daughters, older daughters weren't very attractive. Um, and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would, um, somebody, this handsome man was gonna marry her.

I did stairs, did a lot of, uh, I, I don't know, uh, I don't know. There, there was always somebody there and there was always, always somebody doing something to me.

Uh, I worked all day and I went to sleep and, uh, just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back to work the next day about, uh, one o'clock or one 30 in the morning. I had to go to the bathroom. And that's typical for me. And, uh, I had trouble getting the covers off. Uh, I was laying on my left side. Uh, I remember that because I, I had right side weakness and the blankets just felt really heavy. And, uh, so I really had to work at it to lift the blankets as a, it was like they were full of bricks or something. And so I got them off when I just really focused on it. And then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom, the next room over was too far for me to walk.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    I was exhausted. And so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed and, uh, I laid there for about half an hour. And, um, I think I kind of dosed off a little bit while I was down there. And then I got up and, uh, thought I'll try again. But as soon as I stood up, I realized, no, I'm still just too tired. So I crawled back in bed and, uh, about, uh, seven 30 or eight o'clock, I decided to call a fellow at work and, uh, tell him that I wouldn't be in, uh, my boss was a creep. And so I avoided talking to him when all possible. And so, but this guy was, uh, kind of, uh, the boss' pet <laugh>. And so I, I'll just call him. And uh, when I used my cell phone, I had that guy's cell phone number and desk number, but I thought, sure, I selected the desk number 'cause I was really not even wanting to talk to him either.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:17    But I thought I'll just leave him a message. Well, he answered the phone and, uh, so it had to be before eight o'clock. 'cause I was really surprised he answered the phone. And I said to him, Brian, uh, you're at work already. And he said, no, you called me on my cell phone. Well, what's up? And I said, well, um, my, my brain's not working right today, so I'm not gonna come in. And, uh, I chose those words carefully. I didn't want them to know there was a health issue, um, but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not coming in. And I certainly needed to make that call.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And, uh, so, uh, he took it as humorous and I was fine with that. It was kind of why I said it the way I did. Um, and, uh, as a side note, when I came back to work, he recalled that conversation. He said, I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me. And I said, no, Brian, I wasn't trying to tell you anything. I was, I was not, this was not a call for help. Uh, I already had in my mind what I was gonna do, but I just needed to let you guys, I know I wasn't gonna be here. And so he was real relieved to hear that. And, uh, so I felt bad when he said that. I was like, oh gosh, the guilt, this guy's carrying around for nothing, you know? And, uh, anyway, so, um, I called either before him or after him, my gentleman friend. And, uh, I never call him. We've been going together for about six years. \n"

So the mice in the bluebird said, look, we have a present for you.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    And they,  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:05    Um, unveiled the dress in Cinderella was so happy because it was a beautiful pink and white dress. Oh.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:16    But she put it on. And when the  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:23    Step sisters saw it, they ruined it and said, you can't go to the ball. Um, they knew that Cinderella was, uh, the fiercest in the land, and if the prince saw  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:43    Her, everybody  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:45    Would just melt away because, um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:49    Her beauty was  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:52    So deep.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    So, um, they decided to not,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:00    To let her go to the ball,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:03    And she was so sad. And, um, so then a theory  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:14    Godmother came and said, look, I can let you go to the ball until midnight. We can make the horses, um, beautiful. We have a pumpkin to turn into a coach. And the,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:33    The, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:34    Foot soldiers, they will be the mice. But there is one condition you have to leave  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:41    At  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:42    Midnight, because  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:43    When you hear the clock  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:47    Strike midnight, everything goes back to the way that it was, the horses, the pumpkin, the mice. So you have to run away before anybody sees you. And so she goes to the ball and has a beautiful time with the prince. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, um, the clock is striking midnight. And, um, she says, oh my God, I have to go. And she, um, goes down the steps and the, the personal assistant of the king says, Hey, wait a minute. You forgot this. But Cinderella had no time to look back. And, um, when she was home, she realized that she had lost one of her glass slippers. One was beautiful, but the other one was not anywhere to be found. \n"

So when they would ask me these questions and quiz me, I was frustrated. I felt so stupid 'cause I couldn't do them. But if I'd have known <laugh> earlier that that's what they were doing, it would've made it so much better. But, you know, they didn't think to tell me that. But, um, I did, uh, games on my phone. Um, I went to a local college that had, um, meetings on a Thursday evenings for two hours. And so the first hour, everybody's in the same room, and then the second hour we're split up into groups and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into. So you go into a group with about four or five other people who, uh, are about your same level. Um, I bought books, uh, grade school books for math and reading and uh, tracing letters and numbers. Um, and I did  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    That on my own. And I did, uh, puzzle books. And then, uh, I went back to work. I went back to work very quickly way before I really was able to do much, but I just thought, I've just gotta get in there and do it. So I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke. Um, there was something, oh, um, I always liked to cook, but now I've really kicked it up. Um, I found a about healthy eating and I've always liked junk food and I decide to eat really healthy. I felt like that would help me recover. And, uh, so I, uh, I got this cookbooks and, uh, learning to understand measurements again, was difficult at first, but I learned and I still struggle with it sometimes. \n"

Um, I guess it starts off Lisa, the way I remember <laugh> starts off showing how her husband and wife were very, um, very good people and they treated her as they should. Very, very, very kind and with, with a lot of love. And, um, that would, would of course have been great except, um, like her, her, her like mother died and I guess a lot of those, like Disney shows do that sometimes. And, um, so the dad was a good man, but, um, like a lot of people, I guess, would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else. And so that ends up happening and really messed up by marrying this other woman who ends up, she's just so cruel and so selfish. And, um, o okay, what I just said before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life. And so what I mean now is that the, uh, what is it called? The other woman, um, she now has, uh, the power I guess, where she's really being awful with, um, with, with Cinderella. And I guess maybe even the, her dad might have died. I don't remember about that. Anyway, so they're showing, they would show in the story then. Now how Cinderella, her life has just totally changed. She went through, um, a really nice life which was deserving to her 'cause she was a very, very, very wonderful person, very sweet and lovely  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    To, to people and cared about people and wouldn't have hurt anyone. So now that the other mother is now there, um, the other mother, uh, makes Cinderella do everything, all the washing and, uh, everything you can think of, cooking, I guess, cleaning, whatever you do. And the, those two sisters that the other, what are those called? Those two other girls, um, are just so mean to her. And so just very, like, very snotty, horrible.

I loved the work, but the people were just insane and, uh, bullying people to get things done. And I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over. But I was afraid to look for another job, um, because if the next job doesn't work out, um, because I left this job on my own, I wouldn't get much unemployment. So I was really afraid to move. And there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work. So I felt really trapped, but I was looking, but it was just, there really wasn't a lot to pick from. And, well, anyway, the day, three months or so before they laid me off, uh, I just had a feeling it was getting ready to happen.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:16    So I started collecting my information that I was gonna need later, and I put my notes in a notebook and I took 'em out to my car. And then when I wanted to refer to them, I went out to my car and looked at them. I didn't keep 'em at my desk. I took everything outta my office except for things that belonged to the company. Uh, I saved off programs. I had written everything. And so then when the boss and the HR guy came to my office and told me, um, I was real happy about it, <laugh>, I tried not to look so happy about it, but I was really happy. And then, uh, I was out of work for 10 months and it was okay 'cause I had unemployment, I had money savings, and I was doing all right with that. The great thing is also that I got a wonderful job and now I work from home full-time for a company that's, uh, in Minnesota. And so, uh, my boss as I have now, is wonderful. Uh, he's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice person. And I still do the same kind of work I used to do, but now it's for nice people.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:31    That's wonderful. Here is another set of pictures. Take a little time to look at them.

And then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that, but, uh, there's a hole in the window, then there's a hole in the window, and he, the guy is holding the soccer ball looking at the window.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    Uh, so not sure what it is gonna do about the, uh, about the kid who kicked soccer ball through the window.

Um, again, I'm going off to school. I'll be okay. So he goes, um, goes out the door, tells mom goodbye. And, um, he gets out there going on his way to school and it starts raining and you can see he's got a little word there and rain rains more and more. And now it's, uh, it's a downpour and it's raining pretty hard and he is kind of running to get outta the rain. And, um, he ran back home and, uh, he did see his mom is kind of upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the, uh, umbrella.

And I thought, I think I better stop because it's getting too hot. So I cleaned up, I had a shower, and um, I went shopping. I was looking for curtains, and, um, it was getting later because I always liked to get home by three o'clock to watch my program. So, uh, on my way home, I was passing another store, which had which curtains. So I thought, well, let me check it out in there. So I went in there and as I'm walking around, all of a sudden I'm like, um, the, the light was going in and out, you know, nothing hurt, nothing hurt, but it was just getting weird.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:11    And I thought, what is happening? So I thought it must be from the heat. So, uh, I thought I better go home. I'm driving and I'm by myself. So I went home, got quick, uh, cooled out, and I had, uh, something to eat. And then I sat and my story came on, and, um, I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything, but all of a sudden my son, who lives with me, he's calling me and he comes home about five o'clock. And, um, <affirmative>, I opened my eyes and he says, what are you doing? He says, you should be cooking. He says, it's, I says, oh, you're home early? And he says, no. He says it's five o'clock. So between that time and the story was about to start, and five o'clock I was out, but I could talk, I could walk, I could, nothing, nothing bothered me. But I got in the kitchen and I stood there and, and I said to him, what do you mean I have to cook? What am I cooking? Supper, okay. So I took a few more steps and I says, what do I have for supper? What am I making for supper? He says, what? You were, we were making lamb chops on the grill, and I had them marinated. And, uh, I says, well, what was I making? So he, he told me,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And I said, where are, I didn't even know where they were. He says, in the refrigerator. And I didn't even know what a refrigerator was. And then I started to get, not scared, but I, something's wrong with me because I'm talking, I'm talking very clear and everything, but I didn't know anything that was going on. Um, in my mind I did, but I couldn't get them out. So, um, he looked at me and, um, he says, what's wrong with you? I says, I don't know. Something's wrong with me. So I have a daughter who lives in, uh, Vernon. And, uh, I said to him, I says, call. And I looked. I says, call, you know, you know, so, uh, I couldn't get her name out. \n"

And finally, they, they got an invitation from the Prince that there was gonna be a gala at the, at the Princess Palace. And, uh, they, they told her she couldn't go. 'cause she wa she wasn't invited, and only they went. So after they were gone, uh, the fairy godmother showed up and, and showed them how she could do it.

Um, and, uh, so while I was in the hospital, she provided a lot of papers for me to, um, think of words and, uh, uh, some simple math to do, uh, but mostly words. And I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next. And, um, it was like really important to me. I was just super motivated. And, um, and then when I was released, it was going to be a month or so before therapy would start up, and so I contacted her again and I said, can you email me some stuff?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:21    Because I just, okay, so I can't see anybody for a month, but I don't wanna let up here.

And, and so I'm not in the hospital, so I didn't give it to her to check it. Now I just figured that that's not right. But, but it's stuff to keep doing. And, um, I got adult coloring books, uh, because of a high fine motor skill issues with my right hand. And, um, I went to a teacher supply store and uh, got some kids reading and a math workbooks, uh, for, it looked like about a third or fourth grade. That's where I estimated my level was at at the time. And so, um, 'cause when I looked at higher grades, like fifth and sixth, I was like, I can't begin to even do this stuff. But third or fourth, it was like, okay, this is a little bit of a reach for me. Let me start here. And so I did that and um, I got puzzle books for kids, um, to do. And so I did those. And, um, I always did like to cook before, but now I had a, uh, um, special interest in cooking healthy food and I wanted it to be food that tasted  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Good. And, uh, so, um, I got some healthy, uh, recipes and, uh, worked on those and I was surprised to see that I struggled with, um, uh, conversions, like a jar of garlic. Half a teaspoon is one clove. And when the recipe called for two cloves, I struggled with that. I was like, and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon. So I did two half teaspoons <laugh>. 'cause I knew that would work. Um, and so, and I learned to highlight in the cookbook, uh, everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl. I would highlight, you know, in one. \n"

Um, of course I, when I was, when I was in the hospital, um, uh, I don't remember, you know, for about two months, I don't remember anything and I wasn't doing anything. I, as far as I know, I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not, but probably not because there wasn't anything to work with. Um, I, you know, I couldn't talk, um, I couldn't, um, do anything. And interestingly, in July, so that was, that was, that was May in July, middle of July somewhere, I had another stroke.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:57    And they, I was, at that point, I was in a, uh, I was in a, a rehabilitation center, a rehab hospital. And they, uh, they took me, uh, my ambulance because I, I felt, I could feel that something was going on and I was afraid it was a stroke, but I couldn't say it. I was a stroke. I knew there was something going on, and Sharon could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem. It took me to hospital and, um, did, um, scans and so forth. And sure enough, I'd had another, I'd had another stroke. I, while I was there in the hospital, um, up until that time, I could not move my legs at all my hands. I, I would, no, I couldn't do anything with it. I, you know, just, that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:07    But while I was in the hospital, um, I started being able to move. Oh, and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost, uh, my ability to focus my eyes together, so I could only see outta one eye at a time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side, and I'd wear it for a while over the side and, you know, but I clearly have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see, uh, with both eyes, I could see with both eyes, but I'd see different, different things. And so, uh, when I had the second stroke, or when this third stroke in the hospital, uh, the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Vision started to clear up. And I remember telling me town, Sharon, I said, my vision's getting better. I can see better. I can focus, I can focus with my eyes. And, uh, and I, it turned up I could. And then I also told her that I thought I could start, move my leg a little bit. And, you know, 'cause when you're, when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not. You think you're moving it, but it really isn't. And I said, you know, look at my leg and see if it's moving. And, uh, because I really felt like it was, and indeed it was moving, it was moving. So whatever happened in this second stroke was, was good for me. <laugh>, because I was able to start moving by a, a, a muscle first time, I was able to move a muscle, any muscle. \n"

She, um, was made to, um, clean the house to do all the work. Um, the girls treated her badly, excuse me. Um, she, she was not happy, but she couldn't do anything about it. Um, so in the meantime, they received a notice from the prince and the king that he was holding a, um, he was holding a d he withholding a ball for all of the, for the whole, uh, group for everyone so that they could come and see if, if the prince could find someone to get married to. Um, they were all willed and getting all dressed, and, um, Cinderella didn't have the clothes to go to. So the mice who were her friends created a beautiful, beautiful, full length gown for her. Um, and she went to get ready with the rest of them thinking that she would still be able to go.

Uh, her from, uh, near Washington, Indiana, in Washington, Indiana, myself, from a playing field. Uh, and it was before classes started at Purdue, August of 1972. Uh, it was, uh, uh, her first day on campus, my first day on campus, um, there was to be a, a dance at, uh, the, the dorm I was staying at, uh, uh, this, this one night. Again, again, each is our first, first day on campus.

And, and, uh, and, uh, my wife and, uh, and her, her, her wingman or girl, girls, girls go with bodyguards. I get that. It's, uh, her and her and her wife and her and Sandy and a wingman, uh, uh, showed up there at, at this, this, and, uh, uh, and, uh, Sandy is wife has never met a stranger. They, she's a, a true, uh, extrovert. Matter of fact, you look up in Webster extrovert, it says, see Sandy Barton. Uh, but anyway, so, so, uh, she and a girlfriend, her, her, her wing man walked up to me and said, well, he is the, is the, the dance here. And, and well, I answered I was supposed to be, uh, that's why I'm here. And, and, uh, and we, I just, uh, I hung around, hung I, uh, hung around her that, uh, that, that dance. And, and, uh, that's where when we started dating and, and, uh, we, we dated probably three years or so, dated around about three years or so. And, and after about, uh, four years, I figured out that, well, maybe something's going on here and ought to get more serious about this. So it was just, I, I, I, I accused her of, of, uh, picking me up at a, at a, at a, at a school dance. That's where, where we first met her. She picked me up at a dance.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:52    All right. Here are some more pictures. Um, take a second to look at them. They tell a story.

So, um, they said, let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him. And, um, so when they got their paper, um, I think she even gets to go, they didn't say she couldn't go, but she had a beautiful dress in her. Um, I say it's, it's not a, a box, it's something pretty, but I don't know what they call those things, <laugh>. And, um, but she was looking at the dress and, oh, I'm gonna look so good.

And so she was kept looking at the clock. She's good at that, she's watching. And, um, so as they were dancing and everything, she thought, oh, I gotta go.

So, you know, um, I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point. And then there she is, and she said, well, can I try? And so she sits down and it fit. And so, um, so she, uh, she made it, and so they put her, you know, took her back over to the, the castle and they get a Mary, and, um, what is it called? Um, happy, whatever you call it.

Um, she longs to be an aristocrat, aristocratic and, and <laugh>. So, uh, what she does is she, she worships these, these two girls and they treat her really, really quite badly. And, uh, so, um, Cinderella has a, a, a, a dream about, uh, and, uh, or a longing at least to have their lifestyle. And she has a dream where she is. Um, well, it's not really a dream in reality. She pretends to be the, one of the, uh, uh, uh, daughters. And, uh, she is found out because the shoes do that the her daughters wear do not fit.

But the princesses, no, the magic lady, um, came along and she was a good fairy and she made a beautiful dress for Cinderella. And she made the pumpkin turn into a beautiful coach and the  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Dog into a concert, uh, some kind of person to help with the coat. And then the mice were turned into magical horses. So then Cinderella went off to the ball and she had a wonderful time. And the prince thought she was very beautiful and had nice dances with her. And the stepmother and stepsisters were jealous. And so they were whispering and talking. And the princess, no Cinderella went. \n"

It took much, much longer than normally to do it, the puzzle, but, uh, I was able to complete that. And then, uh, had normal evening and went to bed early. Got up the next day and went to a exercise class with a group that we'd meet early in the mornings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. And this was a Friday morning that I'd gone to work on Thursday, couldn't work. So then Friday when I got up, I went exercise with the group. And with the group, uh, we'd normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit warm up. And while we're walking, we talk and visit with each other. And, uh, when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group, what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the, the words that I was, uh, speaking.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    Uh, the words were correct, but they were not making sense as complete words, you know? So I said there knew there was something wrong. My friends knew there was something wrong. So I, when I got through the exercise class, we spent an hour exercising together. I went home and, uh, had breakfast and uh, I told Patty, I said, there's something wrong. I need to, to go to the doctor that I wanted her to take me to my heart, doctor <laugh>. And she decided that rather than that would take me to the emergency room. And there at the emergency room, they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke. And so I spent the next three days, there was a problem with my heart. Uh, my heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm. And so they spent most of the time for the next two or three days correcting that issue. And then after they corrected that, then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia, and then discovered that I'd had a stroke and had aphasia. So that's pretty much where I am.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:51    That sounds like it could have been really scary, but you just handled it like it was another day.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:00    <laugh>. Well, I tried to, no, I really didn't. You know, I just thought I had a headache, you know. And, uh, talking with Patty later, she said on, on the Wednesday, the day before I woke up with a headache, she said, you had a headache that, that day too, like Wednesday night late, I mentioned that I had a headache then. So I don't remember that at all, that part of it. But it's,  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:33    But  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:34    So  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:36    Do you still play Sudokus?  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:39    Yes. Yes I do.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:42    Very nice. My, uh, grandpa got me into Sudokus <laugh>. His name is actually also Jerry.

Her, her mother was very angry with that idea and thought, well, I suppose, uh, that Cinderella can simply be a servant, uh, this for her, for herself and for her own two daughters. Uh, and sure enough, that's what Cinderella mostly did. She almost, she mostly worked terribly. And, uh, and she was, and, and, uh, the, the other three daughters were of course, uh, hideous and, uh, and, and vicious. And they, uh, they were of, they were, uh, they, they, uh, they, they, they really, they didn't stay in the, in the, uh, in, they didn't stay in the, in the, uh, uh, but anyway, they, they, they had a quiet, they had another spot, a servant's quarters, uh, that they had to, had to keep.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:19    Um, there was a, it was a beautiful, uh, day.

She can't stay. She's observant, you know, and they are, they were, uh, the bourgeoisie at the place. Fine. And there's no, no, uh, no point in her being here, fortunately for Cinderella, who would've been no doubt weeping, uh, for, for the, the misery of not being at the, uh, at the castle. Uh, CI Cinderella had a fairy godmother who told her about this. And, uh, she said, well, fine. I have a, uh, I have a, a special, uh, place that you can do. I will get your, uh, I will get you a beautiful, uh, uh, dress so you can, you can, uh, uh, come, you can, you can, uh, join with, with it with me.

Um, and so they, they had to, uh, they had to, to, to work all the time and had to deal with the, the, the hideous, uh, uh, sisters while they were, they, they were just having to, having to, uh, to get, uh, uh, to be her work person. So at that point, then, there was a moment where the, uh, the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women, uh, in, in the, uh, in, in the, uh, the, the town. And, uh, Cinderella was thinking, oh, this would be nice. I can really, I can have a, a really time, good time there. Uh, but they said, no, you can't do that.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:09    Only, only, uh, the only, uh, these, the terrible creatures that, uh, that were, um, that were, uh, living in the house are the only ones that could really do this. Then there came a, uh, uh, what do you call those creatures? It's a, uh, uh, it's a, uh, a magic personage, a <laugh>, what they call those creatures. Anyway, this magic personage wanted to, uh, change, uh, all of the, uh, all the, all of the things that Cinderella wanted to, to, uh, to, to read to, to, uh, um, she wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened. And it was the, uh, it, uh, magical creature that made that all possible. Then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw, uh, the prince and the, and the, and the prince was quite enchanted by the prince, all completely. Whereas the, the, the horrible creatures that, that lived in the house, no, uh, had no real particular interest in, in, uh, the prince, uh, sooner or later than the, the prince was, was, was doing quite well. And, but it was time for Cinderella to leave 'cause she had to do that. And, um, and, and eventually then this, uh, the, the, uh, the wonderful time that they had, uh,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Disappeared. Nevertheless, um, the, uh, everybody wanted to, to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for. Uh, and yet that was not to be the case. Then only, and then only, uh, did Cinderella, uh, uh, take all of her, her her fancy clothes once again. And sure enough was exactly the person that, uh, that, uh, they were hoping for. Uh, then, uh, the prince went clunking back to the, uh, to the, uh, uh, the whatever they are, to all of these, uh, uh, to all of the, the workers that they have to, uh, deal with.

And, um, I don't know the story about that, but that's what it looks like. And then, uh, so she says, great, you know, I've got my two daughter daughters and she can be, you know, they can all be friends. Yeah. When, when she's gone. It turns out that, uh, Cinderella actually became more of a, a servant than a friend. Uh, she must have, she must have been sleeping in the, uh, uh, at the stable with the animals, I guess. Uh, she, in one picture, she was making tea for the two daughters. Uh, she was doing their laundry.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:21    She was doing all the work. And, um, like I said, she had become more of a slave than, than anything else. So, um, they lived in the, in the shadow of, of the castle. And, um, I think she dreamt about the castle. Um, looks like she was in one picture, it looks like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something. Like, that's what it looks like anyway. And, um, so it turns out that the, the king little short fat king, why the little short white king is not short fat, but he is, uh, is looking for somebody to marry his, his daughter. And, uh, he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so that the, uh, the, the, the girls can have their, their pick of, uh, they can't have their pick, but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball. And, uh, they'll have a chance to  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Show off to, to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him. So, um, he sent out this invitation, and of course, the, um, the, the, the wicked stepmother or the whatever she is, the mother, she, uh, of course doesn't let, doesn't want Cinderella to go to the ball. So, uh, uh, the other girls go off to the ball and Cinderella stays home and, and she's got, gotta tend to the animals or whatever.

And then down the road a bit, there was, um, sort of the two ugly old lady, two young ladies who were rather, shall we say, not the most attractive people. And then the old lady who was a grump. And, um, and so the whole point of this was they were supposed to meet the, not Cinderella, but the, the, the two, the men and the woman to meet them. And the purpose was who would meet the, the pretty one. So what they did was they got, and they of course they had to get the dresses and they had to look, you know, put all their stuff up.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:24    And so knowing Cinderella, the two ladies, bumblebee and be bubble or whatever, where, um, looking forward to this because they were going to have the chance of meet this handsome man.

So they got ready and they, and they went away to the, to, uh, up the hill for the big up the hill. And problem was that the younger person wasn't very happy because they said, well, we're not gonna give you anything and yeah, you're not, you're not attractive or whatever. So they, uh, uh, they said, we'll, just, you know, she's, she's, we're just gonna stay behind. Well, they felt, sorry, sorry for her. So they looked at a, a big, um, pumpkin, and they said, this isn't right. Why are we not going to do something for her? So they gave, they decided that they, what they did was they met the, uh, pumpkin  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    And they had a magic wand and they did a little, oh yes. And also they were thinking, we've gotta make her, make her better than she was before. So I'm, I'm a little lost in this wand, but I think they did the magic wand and she changed from a raggedy person into a rather attractive looking, um, um, person. And her name would be Ra I think it says <laugh>. So that's what happened. It's not over yet though. So they said, how are we going to get home? Well, they did changed her pumpkin into a, um, into a, a big thing where you have people in it and they were riding it and they went and, and the meantime they met the two old ugly ladies. \n"

And of course, the, uh, the two daughters, of course it doesn't, it doesn't say that, but I'm sure that's what happens to they, everybody in the town, they can't, they two, they have their, the, uh, glass shoe is, is all too, you know, the feet are too big. And then the, uh, the young used to be a blonde with a blue hair. She's, uh, she actually put her, she actually could fit the, uh, a glass shoe and they realized that she's really gonna be a princess. And, um, and then  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    The other thing is, is that I'm confused about when she goes to the, uh, dance. She has a kind of a, a white pink dress, but then she's at the, um, the dance and she's got a much nicer, it's a gown perhaps. It's a really, it's white, very beautiful. And she's got the, um, grass shoes too. And, um, and she runs away. Um, I don't know what happened to the, to that white gown. She's got the, um, pink and white one. She's back in her bathroom, down in the, probably down in the cell where she lives. And then, you know, then she could fit the, uh, the grass, uh, shoe. And she, uh, she's gonna be the one that, that, uh, the prince and the, uh, princess are gonna be married. \n"

He had a, uh, he came to, uh, he came to, uh, a university here and he would meet with people there at the university. And, uh, I was still in a wheelchair at that time.

And she made her clean and she made her do all the work. So as she grew older, she kept looking at the, the, um, at the beautiful, um, she looked at all the other houses and where the king and the queen lived, and she hope someday she might meet the prince.

She found, um, parts of dress in her box, in her, in her, in her, um, call it, we would call it a chest in her chest left from her mother when she died. Um, a beautiful dress that she was gonna wear to the, to the bottle. But when her stepmother and stepsister saw it, they ripped it up and she had nothing and she was crying. And so the mice, uh, said that they would help her, but she got locked up and they said she couldn't go. So she was crying and crying and crying.

Um, do you remember your stroke?  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:03    I do, because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Uh, I normally in the morning go out, get the paper, have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work. And, uh, I went out, got the paper, I still had a splitting headache. I took a couple aspirin, came in and, uh, had a bowl of cereal for breakfast. And, uh, while I was there, I usually read the first section of the paper and I opened it up and I could not read what was on the newspaper. I couldn't see a whole paragraph and blocks of characters were missing altogether. So that's the first thing. So I just, I set the, uh, paper aside and said, okay, I'll read it when I get home. And, uh, got dressed and went to work. I drove driving from work 22 miles from my house to the office.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    And, uh, what I was seeing on the highway, again, on the, uh, dashboard of the car, I couldn't see all of the, in, in instrumentation on the dash, but I was able to drive fine and go to work. Uh, no problem at all there. When I got to work, I tried to log in to my computer at the office and I couldn't remember my login, didn't know how to log in, and, uh, I still had the headache. I, uh, talked to my boss and, and told her what was going on, and she said, just take it easy for a while and see if you can later remember. And I took probably half hour, 45 minutes and still couldn't. So I said, I, I just can't do it. I'm going to go home. I came home, took a couple more aspirin, and went to bed and slept the rest of that day. That was on a Thursday. On Friday morning I got up and I exercised on Friday, Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I exercised in the group early in the morning, so I went to exercise class and um, I exercised, but when I was with the group, I was talking and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me, wasn't making sense to any of my friends. You know, they, the words were correct, but what words that I was speaking were wrong words, you know, they didn't fit what I was saying, and so I said, there's something wrong there. \n"

And so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that, um, Cinderella was a happy wow. Could I ever do something like that? You know? But they saw that the other two stepmothers see it and that their mom and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen. This is hard, but the, um, mom realizes, uh, oh, better not have with Cinderella. 'cause it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen. So Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready. And again, I always liked that part of the movie as I recall, because I liked how the little, uh, animals were even helping her. 'cause everything loved her 'cause she was so wonderful. So they made us, made her beautiful thing.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:20    But then the stepmother got where she, she, she couldn't go. And so then Cinderella was really crying, as I remember. That's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken and, you know, how could they not even let me do anything? And then there's this very godmother person pops outta nowhere, <laugh> and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful, what she's gonna wear and where she can be driven. She gets there and she can dance and he sees her and wants to dance with her. And, uh, he's captivated by her. And, um, all of a sudden Cinderella realizes, oh no, it's by this midnight where she has to leave before everything was gonna change back. So Cinderella gets home and she's still kind of happy, uh, which is, I thought that was always amazing. She was still, she's just happy and, and so honest about, wow, I got to actually do something like that. And she thinks that's the end that would ever be, but she was still happy. And so then  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:00    With the Prince, he is like, I have to find out who, who, who that, who that was, which I, I wouldn't really blame him. Of course he's gonna wanna meet her and goes, he wants to, he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her. So, um, he has to go, has a decree I guess, that popped in decree to every single unmarried person has to be, figure out who that was because, oh yeah, I forgot when, when Cinderella was leaving, she left one of her things, I can't think of what it's called, behind your foot thing. \n"

It took me 30, 40, 42 days between each ho, between the two hospitals. And at the end of the 2 40, 42 days, which some I remember, some I don't. Um, they entered me into mount, no. \n"

And so that was, that was like 1991 or something like that.

She had a heart, he had a heart transplant, and, uh, it, uh, it didn't take very well. You know, heart transplants are long run out things, and she, he lasted about five years, and finally he gave out. In the meantime, my, my wife, uh, with Huntington's disease, um, was moved to a, uh, uh, we had her in a, uh, nursing home. She spent five years in a nursing home, uh, that then, and her nursing home was in the same town, about four or five blocks away from Sharon's friend. I had no idea they, that she lived there. I had no idea that she lived in that, in that town or anywhere. Um, so, um, so at one point my wife finally, you know, she went downhill and went downhill and, and, and passed away in, uh, 2002. Uh, I called Denise, my sister-in-law to tell her that, uh, Judy had passed away. And, uh, Sharon, uh, and then, and, uh, Denise said,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    I, I can't believe it. Uh, Calvin just died yesterday, and Calvin is sharing something. They, they both died within one day of each other. Um, strange coincidence, um, over, over time, um, I, and not right away, but over time, I, uh, Sharon was living up there in the, in, in Cedric, the town of Cedric, where the nursing home was.

And, uh, we were, you know, talking and I was walking around. I had to go to the bathroom and I knew where the bathroom was in the hospital. And I went there.

Now when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything, they're not gonna say, oh, I'll stay at the hospital <laugh>, especially on a weekend. So we went home. So my, my son-in-law took me home to her, his house to my daughter's, and I was there for the weekend. And, um, they had gone away for, um, the weekend, not the, the whole weekend, just over overnight that one day. Because originally I was supposed to babysit for them anyway.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    So, uh, just by luck, my daughter said to her husband, bring your father up too. I don't think mom should be by herself. So, because I had two grandsons and they were little. So, um, the father came up and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I cried just like that, and I just wouldn't stop crying. And then all of a sudden I'd sleep, I'd sleep for hours and I didn't realize it. And then, uh, we went the weekend, we went to the doctors and, uh, well, she seems to be fine. She's talking, she's doing this and she's doing that.

But, uh, Cinderella starts with, uh, she was, had a wonderful mom and also dad, father and mother. And they were loving and, and kind, and she was too. And, um, something happened, which a lot, a lot of old the Dizzy movies did showing that one of them passed away. And that was her, um, her, sorry, her like mother. So her dad, her father, um, met this other woman and decided to, uh, he'd like to have her, him and her get married. And, uh, as I always watched it, probably most of us seeing that would go, oh no, don't be marrying this particular person. But he did. And that person had a couple, uh, a couple like, sorry, a couple like daughters that she owned, and it's shown that they're all very, very mean. Not only to to Cinderella, but even to themself. They just, they're just very, all they think about is, uh, themself. And the, the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money when she gets married. So they realized that Cinderella is just a very beautiful person. I mean, she's, she's very, she's very pretty and beautiful, but she's inside. She's just a really sweet person who, who caress about people.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:22    So the, uh, oh, I think it's called Stepmother. I think that's what it's called, um, realizes they need to, she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing, working with her daughters. And so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy, wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life, because all that she's can do is constantly  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Clean and wash and whatever else she has to do, cook for the other three people. But yet during that time, Cinderella still stays somehow, basically happy, um, at least for the most part, and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them. And so around that time, the, uh, the Prince, uh, um, his dad, I can't think of what that's called, um, wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all. \n"

And, um, then when it was over, Jeff said, have you ever thought to go back to school and become a principal? And I said, oh, no. Uh, I love the kids too much. Uh, um, uh, I wouldn't like that at all. And he said, no, I think you should think about doing this. Uh, uh, seriously. Think about it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:31    And so the next, uh, week, um, they put a, an ad in the, um, the schools, uh, it was going to be, um, a precursor to, uh, going back to school to become a, a principal, an administrator. I said, oh. And I said, what do you think of this, Jeff? And he said, I, I think you should go, because it is offered in Lynn, and it is, um, all of the principals, like about four of them, uh, gonna put on a presentation and talk about it and then see if you would like to. And I said, oh, okay. Yeah, okay, I will. So I went and I said, oh, wow. I'll, I think I will do this. And um, for two years I had to go and it was at Gordon College, but they brought it to Lynn because of all of the participants were from Lynn except for one person. So they, uh, after school at the ad building, they would come and we would do a class, uh, a semester. Uh, and um, it was very interesting.

And I then went to the Marine Corps and be, was, went through training to become a second lieutenant. And I was a second lieutenant in Vietnam. And, uh, luckily I made it. I lived through it. And, uh, that, that was pretty much my, pretty much college of freshman year. I mean, my graduated college, then going to the Marine Corps, I became a lieutenant because I, I was gonna get draft, I was gonna get drafted, so I enlisted and then I ended up getting out early because they, they, we came, we pulled out of Vietnam. So I was in Vietnam for I, uh, 10 months as a lieutenant and a captain. \n"

And when we went down the road, I don't remember who or how it was decided, which hospital I was going to, but I think I went to the best possible one. Um, and when we got there, um, there's like four of 'em in a row down there. We call this hospital row. So, um, my street is always the first in the city to get paved. Well, maybe the governors and then mine <laugh>. So, um, then she didn't understand where to go exactly. She, I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didn't know where it was. And I saw the red lettering and I couldn't read it. That is so significant to me.  \nSpeaker 0    00:00:59    'cause I remember I could not read that word. I knew what the word was, but I couldn't say it to save my life. Um, but well, I could say it, I just couldn't read it. And uh, so I pointed and I said emergency and so I wasn't reading it, you know, it was like, it's red and I just know what that word is because it's red. And uh, so we got to the entrance and there was like, uh, I wanna say canopy, but not really a canopy, uh, but something to keep you out of the rain and um, overhang or whatever. Um, and I caught the eye of a policeman that was, uh, sitting or standing there. His job is to check people for weapons before they get into the hospital. And uh, I waved at him an motion for him to come and he did.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:00    And I told him, uh, I think I've had a stroke. And I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility. I don't even remember. But, but uh, and I said, but I'm afraid to walk. And I was walking fine, but I just never had a stroke before. So I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now and all of a sudden I can't, you know, I didn't know. So I was afraid to walk. And uh, so he said, hold on, I'm gonna get someone. And a nurse came out real fast and she brought out, um, she came out first and then, uh, I told the same thing to her and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair. I think it was just inside the door. And so she got me in the wheelchair and we went in and um, I remember looking at the people in the waiting room, it was pretty full. And I felt kind of guilty 'cause I was being rushed to  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    The head of a line. And I almost wanted to say sorry, but I think I had a stroke. But, you know, just not appropriate to really say anything. I just felt bad. And then, so then, uh, the intake person wanted my health insurance card, so I gave her that. And uh, she asked me am I on any medications? And I remembered, uh, the Metformin, but I called it Glucofage. I think Glucofage is, I think that's the name brand for it. But I couldn't think of Metformin. And, uh, there were a lot of, uh, supplements I used to take and, uh, maybe a couple more meds. I don't remember now, but I couldn't remember the name of them for the life of the. \n"

They, they helped everything about it, but it was nice to get back up, um, where you could go the bottom.

Is  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:36    It on the top or the bottom?  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:38    Um, in the middle. Click. And then you can drag it and move the box.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:51    Hmm. Good idea here. I'm just think she'll yell on, Hey mom. Yeah, you want, why you wanna move this so you know how to move this outta the way because I can't see the last one here. Or did I move that internet? Oh, you'll  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:15    Click on the window with my face on it and drag it across the screen.  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:22    But rather here, this is a clear case. Click here and then drag it across this. Ah, I gotcha. <laugh>. Um, it looks like he is not very happy 'cause he got his, um, soccer ball. Um, but he is still looking out there.

Uh, when I, when I actually, when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me, uh, I went to the Y M C A and I got a membership in the y and, and hired at the y a, uh, personal trainer who, who didn't really know anything about strokes, but she learned, she was very good at studying and learning the first time that she saw me. Uh, and I, I was so stiff that she, that I couldn't move. I, I couldn't move anything. My arm was just, dunno if you can see it here. It's, you know, your arm is just like this and it's clenched fist and everything.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:06    And the first time she tried to move my arm, it was like, holy cow, I, I can't move it <laugh>, you know, and it wouldn't move. She worked with me. Uh, I went twice a week to go with her. Uh, and then in addition to that, uh, uh, probably after a while I went, started, I'd say, Sharon, take me down to the Y and let me, uh, I was, I was still using my walker. I'd say, let me just take me down the line and let me walk around the track with my walker. And I'm sure people probably thought stupid. So here's this, this old guy walking around with this, you know, very, very slowly take me, you know, it'd take me a, it, it's a six, six times around the track for a mile and it would take me, um, a half hour to walk around that lap.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:12    And, but I was, I was determined to do it and I did it. I did it. And, um, then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane. I still go very slowly. Uh, I'm doing it. So I'm gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself. And I'm not trying to pat pat myself on the back. I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have, and I'm sorry for them. They don't. But, and I think, I think some, some stroke victims are robbed of their drive. I did not lose my drive always. I've always been kind of driven anyway. You know, I've always been driven, but I was driven to her to improve and get better. I'm still doing, I'm still doing that and I'm getting there and it'll never come to an end, but it, I'll keep working at it.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:33    Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you?

But basically I went therapy three times a week for several months, and then dropped down to a couple times a week. And, uh, we, uh, until finally I reached a point where the standard tests that they did for us were, you know, I'd al already done all of 'em and, uh, reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it. So, uh, yeah. But, uh, starting, I've got a squirrel running across my, uh, patio, <laugh>, but nevermind, um, let go of that one. Uh, but, um, part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the, that we saw with all the drawings of different things.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:23    I had the same thing sitting in a go in a room, sit in here, look around and name each object I see in that room, and, uh, say it out loud, you know, until I can figure, you know, sometimes, you know, you know all these words, you know all these items, but you don't, and not able to pull those words out. And the same thing driving down the street. You look at, uh, say a mailbox, say, say that word out loud, mailbox, a post-op, uh, you know, and, uh, hedges, whatever, you know, whatever you see, make a name, you know, bring a name for that item. And it's something that I've kept along with all the, as long as I've had, uh, some aphasia now is, you know, when I look at something, I'll say the name of that item just to keep, keep it going. And so that's, uh, one of the things I do all the time. I, I don't even think about it. A lot of times it's just something automatic to do.  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:41    Here are some more pictures.

The boy was out playing in the yard, kicking his soccer ball. He kicked his soccer ball a little too hard in the wrong way, and it hit a window and broke the window, fell through right next to our lamp inside the house, and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor, I'm not sure who this person is, whether it's his father or his neighbor. And then the, uh, adult was watching out of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and, uh, broke his window.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:40    Do you think he is looking out angrily or, uh, you think he's just curious?  \nSpeaker 0    00:03:48    Well, at this point we don't see his face. \n"

They were more into that at the very beginning than other like, um, aphasia type stuff. They wanted make sure I was able to, to walk again and 'cause my one side of my, um, body was starting to have trouble, they said. So they wanted to start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that. At the beginning they started doing some little task for me. Like, um, we played cards to see how many cards I can find. Looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that. But we were doing that just here and there feeling. Um, I was also very sad, very, um, emotional feeling didn't, I couldn't even remember who I was. And so, um, getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are, I was more panicked than that kind of stuff.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:09    Um, once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year, two, uh, days, I figured out how people were that I remembered. So, um, said, let's go for our therapy now. Let's start walking around and stuff. So once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit <laugh>, um, we started working on therapy and, um, they said, you have aphasia. Um, and my talking, I couldn't say pretty much any, I couldn't say anything. They were saying like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So they give me like a cup, do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me, and I go, yes or no. It took me a little even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:04    If you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out.

And then, uh, but I know the, the fairy godmother said that she had to be home by midnight, and, uh, she was having such a wonderful time, and all of a sudden she realized she better go. And she was in the pumpkin, right? So the, she goes into the pumpkin. Um, but in her, her, uh, well, she was, uh, getting out of there. She, uh, lost one of her shoes, and he, uh, the, the, uh, prince, you see, he was looking for, um, uh, a wife and a queen for his, his, uh, uh, for his castle. Anyways, so he went away and, oh, I think really the si this, the ugly sisters, they, um, didn't want to, um, they didn't realize that it was her because she, I mean, she usually is in res. But anyways, she goes home, she gets into the other, the, her old clothes, and, and then he, he starts the church. And of course, the sisters,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    The step stepsisters try to remember they want a fit, um, in that shoe, because then the prince will think it's her or him. And, uh, they, uh, they cannot, uh, she, they have big feet. And eventually in the background is, is Cinderella and someone checks the, uh, the foot. They said, oh, you know, she didn't have to do that, but she did. And sure enough, she, she, the, uh, her foot fit into that shoe and she had the other one, and she, she found the prints and lived happily ever after. \n"

And, uh, so they grew up that way. Uh, and then, uh, over time, she, uh, got to know the animals in the home, a horse and the dog and the mice, and, uh, had more of a friends with those than with, uh, the other two people. Uh, and then, uh, as she grew the, uh, family or the king in that neighbor neighborhood, <laugh> city, whatever, uh, had a son that was grown at the same time and he decided the son needed to, uh, meet a girl his age and possibly, uh, don't know what the situation was there. But anyway, he decided to, uh, create a ball to bring all the eligible girls in the kingdom in and, uh, meet them and decide who might, uh, be his, uh, girlfriend or whatever, or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it. And so, uh, they sent the invitation out.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:42    The, uh, stepmother saw it and planned on taking his daughters, but not Cinderella. Cinderella wanted to go as well.

And I put a d a soar in the basket of toys and I put a soar on my keyboard and, uh, in my refrigerator and in my freezer. And it was just, and so I would, uh, make these little videos and I would tell him, you're gonna have to come and see granny to help me with these sores. They're outta control.

And so he's right about almost two and, um, so much difference between the two and their personalities. And uh, but the, the first one, he is a super smart, he is also very manipulative, you know, and <laugh>. And so he, he works that cuteness angle, you know. And, uh, then the, the second one, he was a lot more agreeable. He was plenty smart, but I could tell not to the level his brother is, you know, it's like he didn't get stuck quite as quickly as like, you, you had to work with him a while and, but, but then you get in, he was fine.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:54    Um, I think he just likes to analyze maybe more, you know, and just to think things through. So the second one, um, just, uh, super long eyelashes any girl would love to have and just as, just as cute he can be. And um, I went to go see them, um, last Thanksgiving, I think it was, or Christmas. It was last Christmas. I went to go see 'em Christmas. And um, I FaceTimed with them a lot. And so the older one, he is thrilled to see me and he just runs to me and, you know, says Granny, you know, wants me to pick him up and everything. But the baby, even though he'd seen my face a lot on the screen, and he, of course I'd seen him in person too, but not real often. It took him a minute. He had to watch his older brother, like, I guess it's okay to go sit in your ear. And  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    It was like, it seemed like, uh, at some point, uh, a light switched on with him and he was like, she's fine. So I've never had both on my lap and they just, for about an hour or two, I was enjoying celebrity status, <laugh>. It was just, it was just cool. So I, yeah, I always heard how much fun grand babies are, but, um, oh my gosh, instant celebrity is so much fun. <laugh>.

I'm a big kid. I don't need an umbrella. This is not gonna rain. I'll walk, I'll be okay. So he waves goodbye to the mom. He says, got his backpack on head for school. Tell tells mom goodbye.

And, uh, he looks up the sky and he's like, oh no, what did I do? I didn't, I didn't bring umbrella. So he said, I think I'll, I think I'll go home and get the umbrella. And he turns around and he, and it's raining harder. And now the wind's kind of blowing because rain's coming at an angle and, uh, it's, it's quite a bit of rain because as he, as he runs, he is, he's, uh, splashing. So there's enough rain that's making, making, you know, splices. And he's, uh, kind of holding his hand up over his head, like as though he is gonna be able to stop the water off his head. But he runs home.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:19    And, uh, you can tell, say the mom is a little, little, uh, perturbed, but because he wouldn't take the umbrella. So there, there he is all wet, head to toe wet, dripping wet. And the mom just kinda looks at him like, he, you, you, you know, you should listen to what I said. I said, okay, I'm I'll. Okay, so give the umbrella. So she gives the umbrella and head heads back to school and, uh, that's still raining, still raining, pretty hard, uh, coming down at an angle, even more of an angle than it was. So it must be blowing pretty hard about a four, five degree angle. And, uh, he is walking these guy's backpack and he is walking off to school. And, uh, I, the, uh, the more those story is, listen to your mom. She knows best the end. \n"

Uh, and she's my little girl's, probably young, all she's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle and she's got pigtails and little black sandals. Um, uh, like I said, she's riding, riding a tri tricycle. The cat won't, the cat won't come down. So apparently the, uh, uh, the, the dad must've gone up in the tree to get the cat down and, uh, he, he leaned the ladder against the tree, uh, to crawl up there.

I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the, um, that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman. I guess so. Oh, this is hard. So the, um, the, like I'm gonna track where they are.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:41    So the, so it's made by decree that they should have a, they should have this like the, yeah. Okay. This, like, this like ball wherein the ball, every girl that is not married needs to, has to come there and then they'll be able to de to figure out who's the best one that he should. He said Mary. So then they showed him the picture, if I remember right. Uh, his, her new mom seeing reading, oh good, we all get to go to the ball and she's excited 'cause she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will, will be, uh, they will want one of the them. So they're all excited,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:59    Including Cinderella is excited. But lo and behold, um, I think it showed that the other mother says, oh no, you're not going there. Seems to me like, I remember like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear. I think. \n"

And so they had to take me back in to the operating room and my leg was broke and they couldn't fix it. My, uh, lower leg was broke, but it was broke. Instead of breaking this way, it broke that way and it couldn't be fixed. Um, they did break part of my arm. Okay. Um, but there was so much damage to the lower course that this didn't work. I mean, it couldn't be used. So I am now spending the rest of my life in a full cask cask. It can't be, it cannot be fixed at all.

And, um, it was time to go to have dinner. So my partner and I went, uh, downstairs and, uh, we were out of the hotel for approximately, you know, maybe one minute. And, um, uh, I did not notice, uh, what was happening, but, uh, she saw me dropping my purse and then she stayed behind. And, um, she yelled to me, Jenny, you drop your purse. So I turned around, and again, I didn't notice anything, but, uh, when she saw me, she was like, oh my God, something's really wrong. My, uh, according to her, my face was already distorted. Um, and, um, in retrospect, um, um, I realized that I was not able to speak. Um, 'cause uh, she tried to, you know, tell me we need to go back.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:11    And I kept saying, no, no, no. But that, that's all I was saying. Okay. So eventually, um, let's see. All right. Um, I started noticing things that were kinda outta whack, for example, um, at some point I was really smiling, um, on this side and, uh, um, and I felt the emotion of, uh, kind of like, uh, bursting out into laughing. But, uh, then on this side, then I was feeling like, uh, very sad, and I could feel the emotion, and it's like, you know, what's going on? And then all of a sudden I noticed that, uh, my eyes were deviated to the left. Um, which, um, in, in retrospect, I know that, uh, when you have a brain lesion, um, you guys and, uh, the eyes deviate to the, the left or to the right, depending when the lesion is. Anyway, so finally they went ahead and took me to the hotel once again.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    Um, uh, Eva, um, my partner went ahead and recruited some people that, um, ushered me back to the hotel. And, um, there was a, a medical conference there that the, that I was taking. So it, it's a, um, whole bunch of doctors there. So one doctor came out and then he saw me. He said, oh, he's got, uh, she's got a stroke. Uh, and then proceeded to, um, elevate my neck. And that was the most painful experience I have ever, ever had. Um, and then we waited to the ambulance to get by, I mean, to, to, um, come in and, uh, they did my bottles and, um, the hospital was about, uh, five blocks away from,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:58    Um, where the stroke happened. And they were able to start, uh, T P A, which is, uh, um, t no, T p n, um, p t p a, sorry, um, which is an anti clatting medicine. Um, and you know, between that and homeopathy, that, that was my savoring race. \n"

And, um, but it, when I was, I think 14 in the summer, um, Mickey is my good friend in high school and, um, and her aunt were going to New York because of, um, their aunt.

And, um, so I, I kept asking my mother and asking her, she kept saying, no, you can't. And I says, mom, mom, please. And, you know, she decided, okay. So, uh, we went to New York and, um, I've forgotten the name of the town. Starts with a g, um, a a little town. And, and anyhow, we went to see her. And, um, one of the things that happened, <laugh>, uh, that she was upset with Nikki and I, we both had periods and our aunt told us and how to roll it up and all that. And we rolled it up and we went off, uh, to Coney Island and we got back, everything would be fine. And the aunt was Matt. Matt as heck. What happened was he, she had a dog and the dog knew and he,  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:33    It was all over the house and she cleaned it up instead of waiting till we cleaned it up. And, um, she was upset and, uh, rightly so, but we didn't know that the dog would do that.

So at midnight she didn't realize it was midnight and she had to scoot out, and she snuck out the back way and took off and everybody's looking for her, this, that, and the other thing. And she dropped a slipper. So when she got home, she was kind of crying and then sent her and everything. But the new, the, the big guy, uh, found the, the, the, uh, slipper. And so he was looking and looking and looking to find, find that everybody was going around saying everybody's trying to put their, put their foot in there to, to fit the thing and it wouldn't work.

And I said, oh my God, I, I want to do this. So I went to a special school in Dedham to teach me how to drive. It took me a long time to do that. Um, so when my instructor said to me, I think you can do it, I says, great, let's do it. Um, so I went to the registry, got into an office with a state trooper, and he looks at me and he says, uh, Mr. Flynn, where are you going? I says, well, I'm hoping to get my license. He says, I think not.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:08    I says, why is that because you haven't filled up all that information? I says, yeah, I understand that, but I can't write, I can't communicate that way. He says, it's not my problem. That's your problem. I says, yeah. And I says, want to tell you one more thing too? I said, by the way, you're a bastard. He said, what'd you say? I says, let me do that one more time for you. I was so upset about that. Um, so state trooper looked at me and says, okay, Mr. Flynn, if you look smack, I want you to get in this car and let's see if you can really drive. I don't care about anything else. Let's see if you can drive. I said, okay. I was, I thought for sure I was gonna have another stroke.

I says, I don't care. And made it. And then he said to me, which I thought was very special to me, he says, I want you to go with me to go to Spalding. 'cause you have that monthly meeting. 'cause I need to know for what is like for other people to have strokes. Being your license. Getting license is one thing. Being a friend is another thing. I say, you're right, you're right. So I learned something. Yeah. Uh, so that, that was, so I got my license and, uh, driving now is, uh, I, I never hardly do it at night very much. Uh, well, 'cause I'm getting older with my eyes and stuff like that. But, um, but my ability to drive right now is absolutely fine. I have have no act, no problems.

Um, I think they just, um, forced her to leave. I can't remember how she was forced to leave, but she was, but she ran so very quickly that she left one of her glass slippers back behind. And, um, so the prince knew that, you know, she had been wearing the glass slippers, so they, um, searched all around for the person who owned the slipper. So of course, finally they found Cinderella and they brought her to, uh, try on the slipper and it fits. So then of course, they, uh, married and they were happy forever, happy and ever. \n"

Um, we had, my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage, and we, on the weekends you went to the cottage. And, um, we wouldn't go every weekend, but most of the time we did, especially with summertime, but not schools, you know, we would, um, take that time and, um, I think that was one my favorite places to go. We could, um, fish, we could swim, we could, and it wasn't very deep. There was a lot. Now it was deep in the middle, but right now you, I mean, you could, you didn't really have to swim. You could just walk around a little bit. Um, there were frogs, there was, um, um, turtles. Uh, so I mean, it was, we got up in the morning and I think we ate as fast as we could to be, to go outside.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:14    And I think you were pretty much outside until it was time to go to bed. And I remember all of those memories on the fact that, uh, um, all the fun things that we were able to do, like my dad let me, um, we used to have a row boat that had paddles, but we also had one that had the, um, motor in the back. And it, now, you, you were not allowed to go fast. It was like two wait, call it like five, no, five fast. So it wasn't very fast. You could almost swim as fast as you can, the, you know, the boat. But, um, they let me actually mow it that like that. And for me being old enough not to drive, I could use that, that paddle boat and stuff like that. I loved to, um, to drive <laugh>. I just thought that was really cool.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:14    I'm not sure why now. It was like, it was such a big thing, but it was, you know, and I was by myself on the boat, you know, I thought it was something else, you know, and all that. We forgot the gas one time and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid. But I think that was, and at night, um, we had a, we had like a, uh, a place to lay down outside and we would, um, go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty. And I, I think, um, when I have my, if I have a bad night now, I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage. I still remember that kind of stuff. When I have bad nights to go to bed, I think about that place. I don't know. <laugh>. Yeah. \n"

And it became rather troubling to me because having, they just didn't do therapy for their brain injured in those years. So there was no therapy. You just, you are able to survive. It's to, you're able to just get discharged, hospital, go home, uh, and, uh, um, as I just did not do therapy in those years. And, and over the course of next 20 years, uh, wife and I found out about, uh, from people that had at therapy brain injuries later, that the, uh, uh, divorce rate amongst the brain injured approaches 90% and the suicide rate of points, the brain injured is four to five times national average is what they're telling people even 15 years ago.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:11    Um, and so I wanted to, to, I wanted to share that with, with, uh, patients at R h I, to just to, uh, give them hope that, uh, uh, that recovery is re recovery is possible, but it is, takes a long time. And in oh four, when I started there at R h I, uh, it was, I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families, oh, a year to a year and a half recover, year to year and a half recover, year to year and a half recovery. Hey, you don't stop recovering. The rate may be asymptotic, if you will, and slow down pretty radically after a, a year to year and a half. But you never, never stopped recovering. Uh, I had a, in the 80, 80, 84 incident, I had a, a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip. And it was just something that I accepted and it was like a function without it.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:15    And, you know, no big deal. But, uh, to stick a pin there and no, wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't feel it. Uh, no, no big deal. And then it was probably, I believe five years ago, or 2025, I think it was. Yeah, I think it was oh 9, 25 years after the 84 incident, I was in the, in the bedroom, put in my sock socks one morning, and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for 25 years. So what I'm, what I'm telling you actually is that the recovery may slow down, like I say, and mathematically describes asymptotic, but, but still slow down significantly. But, but still, you never stop recovering. You just don't stop recovering it. Don't, I'm done preaching. \n"

And the cat ran up the tree into a le a le a land, how do I say this? Oh, a breach. I'm doing two, I'm not saying it right. Anyway, it's the, uh, it's part of the, it's part of the tree. So this is where the cat eventually got up, was up here. So the little girl could have been, could have been actually seeing the, uh, the dog, um, cha chasing the cat. And, um, but anyway, she, she sees the cat as up there and would like to have it come down. She was probably riding a tri tricycle. Um,  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:20    So the, probably her father put the ladder up on the loom. The loom, the loom, and, uh, went up there and the, and the ladder fell. Um, so the, it's pretty high up in the cat's up there. And the, uh, the man is way up high. He doesn't have a ladder and is, uh, and by the looks of it, is actually his, his daughter's more interested than the cat, than, than her father, or it's a man perhaps. And, um, there's a bird on the, in the tree also, but I don't think they're involved in, um, you don't think they're frank, the cat or anything like that? Um, so the, uh, firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going, um, to first take the, the father down and, uh, then they're gonna get the cat and, uh, the little girl will be happy. And the, uh, the dog, who knows what's gonna happen to the dog's, gonna probably chase after the cat again and find another tree <laugh>. \n"

I'm, I'm, you know, that type of a thing. And she said, no. She said, you're just not making sense. Let's just let it get checked out. And we went. So she had, there was an urgent care. A few minutes away, I walked into the urgent care, still feeling good. We drove there. I walked in, we signed in, gave the insurance card, did all that. Went into the office where the physician was gonna come in, the gal came in, the nurse came in to start to take my pressure. And then I passed out.

I'm assuming it's in his, well I guess it's, I'm assuming it's his home. There's a, there's a gentleman here that will just assume it's his father. So it goes through the window. It, the father sees that all probably actually hits him. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then he grabs the ball and he looks up the window and he's clearly, I'm assuming, not very happy that his window was broken by the  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    Ball. Wonderful. I know. Thankfully that's never happened to me. <laugh> never did that to my mom. Yeah, just  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:10    Whether, whether that's the parent or just the owner of the house, it's probably not very happy.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:15    I know, I know.

It tells a story with the beginning, a middle and end. So just look at the photos and tell me that story.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:36    <laugh>. All right. What I'm guessing from this is the child is getting ready to leave for school from his home. And I would say his mother is saying You should take an umbrella. And I'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella. And so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella. He gets partway to school and it starts pouring. So I'm assuming he's unhappy that he's soaking wet and looks like. \n"

I think those therapies went off from maybe six to eight weeks as I recall. Um, and that was helpful. But I think the real value to me was to continue to work on myself and continue to improve myself. For example, when I was reading, I had to read, write down what I believe I just read, and then practice saying the words. And I've been doing that now probably for about three and a half years. I continue to do with certain situations, but I can see personally my growth from where I was initially, you know, to where I am right now. So I felt that that's been a big help for me. Um, and so I do things like that, but pretty much that is the task that I do. I think that has helped me greatly, uh, improve upon my, my speech. \n"

And then things were just speaking more. Um, mom saw me and the children and that kind of thing. So, you know, all of that started to work much, much more.

There are firemen running towards the tree. So I'm guessing that there was a bird in the tree. The cat may have run up the tree after the bird. Um, perhaps the young girl maybe wanted the cat out of the tree. So then I'm guessing a man tried to help by climbing up the tree on a ladder. And then the ladder fell over once he was in the tree. So now he's stuck in the tree. I think the dog's upset and just perhaps, maybe, maybe the guy came over with the dog and now the dog's upset his owner's in the tree. And somebody either called or the fireman saw that the man was stuck and they're running over the tree with a ladder. I'm assuming they're going to help the poor man out of the tree. \n"

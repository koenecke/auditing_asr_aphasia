He is soaking wet. She is upset with him. And he's got a down-looked face. And then it ends with him walking back, I guess, towards school with an umbrella. Okay.

This is a story of a little girl, a little orphan girl who comes from a very poor family. Her name is Cinderella. And she is sent off to another home with a woman and two daughters who are not very welcoming at all. In fact, the daughters are quite jealous. And the woman is quite, almost mean. She tries, they make a servant out of Cinderella. She waits on the daughters and the mother hand and foot, cleaning, picking up after them, trying to take care of the cat which has little thorn horns on it. And the cat doesn't like it at all. Well, Cinderella, there's the big ball, annual ball coming up at the castle. And the king has raised holy cane with his son about finding the wife. And he decides to throw this ball to get him introduced to the young ladies or the young ladies in the community introduced to him that he might be able to find a wife. Well, she looks out at the, across the rooftops to the castle and she wishes she could go, but she can't. She's poor. The mother and the daughters jealous of her. They don't want her to do anything. All they're interested is in their own well-being and how they're going to look and how they're going to dress and what they're going to put on and this and that.

Or, you know, what'd you talk about? And usually I just get shut down. And I think that probably I keep doing it. I keep asking the questions because I feel like the very little bit of communication she gives me or feedback, I'll take it. But that's not to say I don't use strategy. Sometimes what I do is probably not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive-aggressive with her. And it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't wanna know anything and I'm like, fine, or, you know, I just walk away, usually a little bit later, she will know that she's somehow impacted. I think she knows she has hurt me in some way, that she knows she's now withholding the information and that my walking away is because she knows I want more and because I care. It's like we have to go through a dance. It's like this dance to get a little bit more information. But I do it because anything I can get, I'll take. Thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. It can be happy or sad. It could be from any time, childhood to now, just anything that sticks out to you as being an important event. And whenever you're ready, you may begin. Okay. This wasn't a single time. It was, I would say, every Sunday, just about every Sunday. There were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday. And it was the highlight of my week. My grandparents, my mom's parents, were just everything that I wanted in thought was good about a marriage and a couple. And his willingness to be chivalrous, but my grandma had her own mind. It's like he, at that time, was able to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play, but he did it. And so it was really important for me because I just lived, or I just had my mom at home, to see this really healthy dynamic between two people. And everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there, my grandpa would have, he always had a handful of nuts because there was a squirrel named Petey who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now, I'm sure it wasn't just one Petey, there were probably 20 Peteys, but I thought it was Petey. And I just always called Petey. And so we would feed Petey and then we would go inside and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of dinner, late afternoon-ish dinner. And it was always fancy, like high noon kind of dinner. And everything was always homemade and wonderful. And she laid out the table so beautifully and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so we would do that, we would have our nice lunch and we would all clean up. And then my grandpa would pull carrots out of the refrigerator and we would walk to this little horse stable area right near their house."}, {"filename": "capilouto56a_967489_1207427.wav", "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a family, and there was a mother and a father and a daughter, and the mother died, and the father went out and he found another wife, and he brought his new wife in, but she had two daughters, and Cinderella, who had been the joy of her mother and father, was suddenly relegated to the Cinders, and she had to do all the chores for her two stepsisters, and her stepmother didn't think much of her either, so she just had a terrible time, and then, there was, in this kingdom, where Cinderella lived, there was a king, and he decided that it was time for his son to get married, so he set out an edict that all the eligible, young, attractive women in the kingdom would come for a ball, and they would have a ball on a certain night, and so the invitations went out to all and sundry, and he came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters, and they were all eligible, but her two stepsisters were not very pretty, so, but they got really excited, and they got, oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have marvelous new clothes, and marvelous this, marvelous that, and Cinderella got excited too, and she thought it would be just great, but she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the ball, and she would have to help her sisters get ready, and so the night came, and they got themselves ready, and they went off in a carriage, and they were, you know, looking, looking down their nose at her, and she was ready to cry, and all of a sudden, a fairy godmother showed up, and touched her with a wand, and she turned into this beautiful dress, and then there was a pumpkin, and she turned that into a coach, and then there was some mice, and she turned that into the horses, and she made this beautiful thing for this Cinderella who wasn't going to get to go to the ball, and she had these lovely little glass slippers, but she said, the one thing, you cannot stay out after midnight, so when the clock starts to strike, you've got to leave, you've got to go before the clock starts to strike, so she went to the ball, and when she got there, the prince saw her, and he took one look, and he just fell in love, and so he found her, and everybody else just had to stand back and wait, because that's all he could do, was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found, and they danced, and they danced all over the place, and everybody else was sort of put to the side, but you know what, she forgot that she had to leave at midnight, so the clock started to strike, and she remembered, so she started flying down the steps to leave, but she lost a slipper, and she flew out the door, and by this time, her carriage had turned into a pumpkin, and her horseman had turned into mice, but she finally got home, I've forgotten exactly how, but she got home, and there she was by the, again, in the cinders by the fireplace, and the other two daughters came home, of course they had the story to tell, but along came an envoy from the kingdom, and he said, we're trying to find the girl who belongs to this slipper, and of course the mother, the stepmother said, oh we'll go back to the kitchen, to the cinders, we can't fool with you."}, {"filename": "UMD24_990255_1230182.wav", "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ella. She was the daughter of two loving parents. Only one day, when she's a little girl, her mother dies suddenly. It's very tragic. Everybody cries, everybody left her mother. Her father, in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom, goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women, unfortunately, are spiteful, jealous creatures. He brings them all home to his lovely manor, where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father, partly out of heartbreak and partly out of just a really bad diet, also dies. At this point, the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy. They make her run around working all the time, and they begin mocking her for being dirty, and they call her Cinderella. Now, their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day, when the prince, who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all of the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands, decides he will marry one of his own people, or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball, and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this. They spend almost all the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns. Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to get out of the house, have a bit of glamor. But of course, they won't let her because they tell her that she would be an embarrassment, but mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball, and Cinderella is left alone, sort of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house, and she begins crying. She's just crying and crying by the fireplace when all of a sudden, a woman materializes from the flames and says, Cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says, I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, oh, well, I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this, so can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs? And you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers, and so that will do. And she waves her wand and the pumpkin turns into a carriage and her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ball gown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass. None nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen. And Cinderella is just overcome with joy and she gets into the carriage and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairy godmother says, unfortunately, my magic power is limited, and at midnight, when the chimes go, everything will turn back, so make sure that you are well away from the ball and out of an embarrassing, compromising situation before that happens. So Cinderella says, I will, I will, and she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball and she arrives and it's even more dazzling than she thought and she comes in and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming. And in the midst of her being greeted by throngs of enchanted admirers, the prince looks up and he sees her and he asks her to dance and they begin to dance and, of course, they're both super hot, so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason. Except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together. And the prince is about to propose to her there and then on the spot and the clock begins to strike 12 and she says, oh no, oh, I need to go, and she runs away."}, {"filename": "richardson21_1428529_1668456.wav", "transcript": "So I may as well do something right now to help make up for that. And so she cleans the place, with all the help of the woodland creatures, who like the way she sings, like deer and birds and bunnies, I don't know, I think Thumper shows up. So she cleans the whole place, and it's sparkling, and then she yawns and falls all across the beds. There are seven of them. And she just falls all across them, and it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there. And about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work, hi-ho, hi-ho. They work in the mines. There is Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Dopey, Bashful, Sneezy. I can do this. Happy, Doc, Grumpy, Dopey, Sneezy. Sleepy? Sleepy. Sleepy's the seventh. Okay. So there are those seven dwarves, and they work in the mines, gathering precious gems and whatnot. And they come a-marching home, because of course it's their home, there are seven little beds for seven little dwarves. And they enter their home, and they see this strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties, they don't know. And so they go up to her, and they wake her up, and she wakes up surrounded by seven tiny men. And doesn't panic, I don't know what's up with that. And so she explains her situation, and because she's so doll-faced and innocent-looking, the dwarves are all like, yeah, okay. I believe you. You can stay with us, as long as you're in danger. As long as you keep cleaning up the place, and like, make our food and stuff, and since she's been working as a servant, she's cool with that. And so she lives with them happily for some time, and then the evil queen has been sitting smug in her castle, thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day, she saunters up to the magic mirror, and she says, mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still, still, Snow White, still, you didn't kill her. And the evil queen flies into a rage, and she decides, if you're gonna do something right, do it yourself. She probably kills the huntsman. She probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out, because they're nice. So she goes down to her lair, where she makes all her potions, because as an evil queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion, that she dips a white apple into, and pulls it out, and it is red as blood. And it is, of course, a poison apple, because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with a basket of regular apples, hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's, like, magically red and delicious-looking. I wouldn't eat it, that probably means that it's been genetically modified. But then she disguises herself as this old crone, and she marches off into the forest. I'm not, I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the dwarves are off to work, and Snow White is sitting in the house, singing at her animal friends, probably. And Snow White answers the door, and says, oh look, an old crone, with a magically delicious-looking apple. I'm probably completely safe. And the old crone says, would you like an apple, child? And she says, yep, still safe. And she takes the apple, and the crone says, yes, child, eat the apple."}, {"filename": "richardson36_270024_509940.wav", "transcript": "Very good.

Okay. So this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella and he didn't want to take it because he didn't believe it'd rain. So right as he started walking outside it started raining and he gets mad and he's stomping through the puddles wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house wet and gets the umbrella and then continues on his journey. Okay. Great. So here's another picture. I want you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Alright. So this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree. Her father thought he could rescue the cat so he brought a ladder, placed it on the branch, and climbed up. And then his ladder fell. So he stuck up in the tree with the cat. And for some reason the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out so they had to call the fire department. And the fire department came and the fire department's on their way to rescue the cat and the father. And that's it. Okay. Great. Thank you. Okay. So now I'm going to have you.

The pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm going to take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures. Okay. And then ask you to tell me the story in your own words. Okay. Okay. All right. So. Okay. So now just tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can. And you can use any details that you know prior or what you just looked at. Okay. So here's what I looked at. So there was this queen who was hoping she'd be the most, the fairest lady of the land. All right. And so she'd ask her magic mirror which had a face in it. And she'd ask who's the fairest lady of them all. And usually the mirror would reply she is. But one day the mirror replied Snow White is. So the queen was upset and banished Snow White.

And poor Cinderella, because she was the baby of the family, always got stuck with doing all the chores. And that didn't matter if she was out tending the animals out in the barn, or feeding the dogs, or slopping the hogs, and even having to cook all the meals. And her two older sisters, they just had to run the house. They just got to go to all the parties and play around the way they wanted to do. And no matter what Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, the grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters. Well, every year they have this large dance in town, and it's to celebrate the harvest and all of that type of stuff. So they have this big party, and everybody gets dressed up, and there's all kinds of food and dancing and so forth. And Cinderella's never been able to go. I mean, she's just always shunned her, because she's just the dog, sort of, as far as the evil grandmother knows. The two sisters come along, and they get all dressed up, and they're off to the party. Well, they're having such a wonderful time, and poor Cinderella's at home, and she's sort of beside herself. But all of a sudden, a fairy godmother appears to her and says, Cinderella, why are you sitting at home? Cinderella says, well, I don't have a dress, and I have no preparations. You know, my grandmother hates me, my sisters hate me, and I'm never allowed to go anywhere. So the fairy godmother says, well, we're going to fix that today, and I'm going to get you a new gown. And in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So she helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown, and gets all these fancy shoes. I think her feet were made out of, like, glass slippers. They were probably like a rock crystal. So she gets transported to the dance, and her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, you know, with the king and the queen and the prince being there, the prince just is really impressed with this Cinderella chick. And so they dance and they dance and they dance and they dance, and the day seems to go by so quickly, but all of a sudden Cinderella hears the clock ringing, and the bells start chiming, and she remembers that her fairy godmother said that, boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight, or else you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person. And all of this stuff is going to be washed away, and everybody will know that it's just like a ploy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from, and in the process loses one of her shoes, but she does manage to get home, and her fairy godmother collects up all of her garb and everything."}, {"filename": "richardson21_881144_1120959.wav", "transcript": "And the mice, the brave little mice who have been turned into horses and chased by cats and made her a dress that got ripped to shreds, still somehow find it within their little mousy hearts to go down and steal the key to the room Cinderella is locked in from the evil stepmother. And they bring it up to her after much trial and error, and Cinderella unlocks the door. She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the stepsister's feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet I would definitely want all the glass swept up. And everyone panics because the stepsisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the prince was dancing with. Obviously that's the only reason they can't prove that. And the advisor is panicking because King wants the prince to get married, the prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe, and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says, but wait! I have the other slipper! And lo and behold, she does in fact have the other slipper, which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why. Fairy godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes and she shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper. And then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot, her tiny foot, I don't think she should be able to stand in real life, and puts it on her, and it fits beautifully of course. And so there was triumphant music, and they all lived happily ever after. The princess, no, Cinderella, she wasn't a princess yet, had to get the ring first. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind, and married the prince. Probably still doesn't know her name. The end. The end. Alright. That was awesome. Is that too long? No, that was great. Okay. Okay. So now I'm going to have you do the same type thing. Oh, excellent. But for Snow White. Okay? Okay. So, again, we've covered up all of the type, so, just look through the pictures. With less comprehensive knowledge of Snow White, this will probably be shorter. That's fine. She's very melodramatic. Look at this. Look at this. What is this face? I mean, I get that she's panicked, but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

So, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as told, by somebody who vaguely remembers it. That's right. Okay. So. Hmm. I'm not sure if Snow White was actually a princess or something before the Evil Queen usurped her throne, or if, like, she's the beautiful cousin or something and we're just waiting for the Evil Queen to die off before Snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there is this Evil Queen. She's got the high, regal cheekbone. She could probably be nice-looking if she wasn't so evil, so I don't know what she's so insecure about. But Snow White is the fairest in all the land."}, {"filename": "wright73a_1223620_1463420.wav", "transcript": "Well once upon a time there was this woman that had two of her daughters and a third one that was like a maid.

And whenever she would come in with some tea or coffee, no tea because it was in a pot, some tea, she would bring it to them and they would make fun of her because she was not dressed like they were. And then they didn't even want it because they didn't feel like having it then. So they complained. And she liked, according to the pictures that I sort of remember, she liked little animals. She liked the mice. She liked the horse. She liked the dog, the cat. And she found peace with them. She got along with them. And finally there was one time that someone brought her a dress, a man, a relative I guess, and she tried it on. She looked very pretty and the sisters were jealous. They didn't want her to have that dress. She looked lovely but they didn't want to admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, hmm, I have to watch you. So that was that. Then they took the dress away. And then by and by they hear that they're going to have a big ball at this palace. And they got some kind of written notice on it. And so the mother says to the two, the three of them heard it together, the little girl that was mistreated and the two stepsisters. They all heard it. They were all very happy.

She finds a little book with a picture and a dress, a beautiful dress. And she says, that's nice. Now the four mice are there and they could hear her. She says, that would be nice. I would like to have that dress. And they make it for her. They make it for her. So she puts it on. She looks beautiful. She has beads. She has a sash. And she has, well, that's what they showed. And then when the time came that they were to go, she came down because they were dressed up. So she was dressed up now in this dress. And they looked at her and she did look beautiful in it. But they tore the beads off, tore the sash off, took off her dress, says, you're not going to that party. Only we, because we look better and we'll win. And the mother is going right along with everything. So she says, you go to your room and take care of what you have to and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time.

And I do forget what happened to the dad, but he went off and it was just Cinderella, the two stepsisters and the stepmother, and the stepmother and the stepsisters used Cinderella as a maid, and they renamed her to Cinderella because of cinders and all the cleaning, and she was dirty, and they told her how she wasn't pretty, and she was really, truly much prettier than her mean, evil stepsisters. And the, what would you call it, the town, the region decides the prince is gonna have a ball, and the two sisters come home and the mom, and they're very excited because there's going to be a ball and all the young women of the lands are invited, and the two sisters start planning their outfits and the mother's involved in it, and all assuming that Cinderella would never even go because she's ugly and dirty, and the prince would never wanna see her. So the night comes, and the two sisters get themselves all beautiful, and off they go to the ball, and I think the mother may have gone as well, and she's left at home, and she's sitting out in the garden, and her fairy godmother appears, and the fairy godmother has a chit-chat with her and finds out she really does wanna go.

So the fairy godmother gets her all beautiful in a dress, her hair's all done up, she's absolutely exquisite, she takes a pumpkin, ba-ba-ba-boom, the pumpkin becomes the beautiful chariot, the mice become the chariot people, they open the doors, they drive her off to the ball, she has a lovely night, oh, almost forgot, as she gets into the pumpkin chariot, which is now beautiful, the fairy godmother says, have a great time, but you must be home by midnight, because all this is gonna disappear, the magic at midnight. So she goes off, she goes to the ball, and the prince is dancing with everybody, and of course he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room, he asks her to dance, they have many lovely dances, and then all of a sudden she tunes in to what time it is somehow, and she says, I must leave, he says, no, no, no, and she's like, no, I really must go, she starts to run off, because it's almost about to strike midnight, she's running down the steps of the palace, she just gets into her pumpkin chariot, she leaves, as she's running, she leaves a sandal step, what you call it, a beautiful pump on the steps, as she goes, the chariot turns back into a pumpkin, she manages to get home in time before the stepsisters, and they come home and say, what a wonderful time, they kind of tease her for being stuck at home, and ask her what she did, and they dream about what a wonderful time, and then everybody learns the following morning that whoever the prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind, and he is going throughout the lands to find whose foot fits the slipper, and it's a very delicate glass slipper, and so eventually they get to Cinderella's home, the two mean stepsisters try to squish their big foot into it, of course it doesn't fit, Cinderella wants to try it, they think it's ridiculous, because she wasn't really supposed to be there."}, {"filename": "wright81a_1340_241130.wav", "transcript": "you take two pieces of bread, or two slices of bread, you get a jar of peanut butter, and you spread one side of each slice of bread with the peanut butter.

Okay, then you may tell me your story. Okay. In April 2016, I went to see Mumford and Sons and I stayed in Indianapolis at the Alexander Hotel with a friend and when I woke up in the morning and I was showering, I remember feeling a lump under my left armpit, my left side and it was in a really funny location. So I was sort of surprised that I found it. So I made an appointment to get a mammogram and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound and I took my friend Dorothy with me and the oncologist who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be consistent with stage 2 cancer. So I called my sister who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff, but she lives in Chicago. So she wasn't going to let me get any treatment or tests anymore in Bloomington. So I went to Chicago to Northwestern for what seemed like that entire summer, May, June, July. It takes many months to compile enough information to be able to treat breast cancer and especially the first time they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they choose the best course of treatment, especially because I was 40. They view that as young and so it's pretty radical. So anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these tests and months and months of agony and then ultimately I have a bilateral lumpectomy. So they found it in both sides actually after all the tests and that was removed. My surgeon at Northwestern was great. Very comforting and confident, which is what I needed. And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery. The medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation and then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. So after I had my surgery a week later, they put my port in and the day that they put my port in I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to where they administer the drugs for chemo. And I had treatment every other week for a couple of months and I recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs were awful and you can taste them, you can smell them, but in your mind you imagine how they are killing cells. They are doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that said, that's I guess how I coped is to imagine these things actually killing, being killed. After my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation and that just made me tired. So that was okay. And then that was right. I finished chemo on my birthday, November 6th. My radiation ended just after Christmas. So my goal was to move into 2017 with no treatments and that's what happened."}, {"filename": "NEURAL62-2_495087_734817.wav", "transcript": "even though he thinks of things he'd like to contribute, there's never the time, and you can't expect the whole world to accommodate you.

It couldn't have a calendar, and it couldn't have games, and it couldn't have a calculator, all the functions. Medicare said they would pay for them if all they did was help with speech.

Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life and she became friends with all the animals in the house except Lucifer, he was a mean old cat, a stepmother's cat. But she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends and she lived upstairs in the attic and always dreamed of the castle she could see from her window. And the prince, I think it was Prince Philip, Prince Philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife so he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so that the prince could meet all the girls in the village and the invitations get sent out and the stepmother opens the invitation and says, oh, it's going to be a grand ball and all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince and Cinderella overhears her telling the story to the stepsisters and she says, oh, I want to go. I'm an eligible maiden and the stepmother says, of course you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done. So she makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do. She says, wash the floor and Cinderella says, well, I washed the floor yesterday. She says, we'll do it again. And she had to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball and as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons and when they're done, she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress, an old trunk that used to be her mother's and she shows them her beautiful dress and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away and she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress but the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready."}, {"filename": "NEURAL39-2_21554_261148.wav", "transcript": "Another injury. All right, so last time, I'm gonna tell you, Deb, we'll see. Last time we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult, so I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother, I have an older brother, and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then, and the boys decided to shimmy a tree to get to the top of a wheelchair, I've got wheelchair in my brain, to get to the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him, and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed but I was pretty scraped up from, and I decided I didn't like following suit with the shimmying of a tree. So they shimmied down, I was not gonna shimmy down. So my brother, little book card, he put a pile of leaves together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof, and yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and try to, my mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff, but no, I wound up with a cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast. So you had to stay propped for a little bit, but minus that, it was a walking cast. I was fine, that's what I remember of that. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating, but what I'd like to know is what the issues were and what you do about those issues, or did. I'm gonna have to tell the same story. So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church, where I was their Sunday school teacher for 10 years and still go to Eagle Eyrie with them for special needs retreat. It's a group of about five to 600 special needs, most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities, which includes like the big square dance. So you just help them, whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they have a hard time walking, but most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate and hear over top of it. The three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers, of which only one communicates. I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two don't. It's a series of grunts. Some sign language over the years, I've of course learned the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. We have her wedding ring upstairs. He brings money in his pocket, that's his dowry, so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate, but through his sign, it's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying. His sister and his mom usually knows that they are communicators, but it's just, they're communicators for them, put it that way. They will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with, so it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer and by facial expressions, you know."}, {"filename": "capilouto56a_141455_381040.wav", "transcript": "This last spring, I was down in the basement doing some work, and I decided to come flying up the steps, and I flew up, but the problem was, I had both hands full of papers, and I didn't hold on to the braille, which I usually do, and I'm usually careful. So I went flying around the corner, and as I turned the corner and hit the third step, I slipped and fell backwards and hit the wall, and of course I fell flat on the landing. There I was, and I thought, well, I can get up, but I couldn't get up, there was no way I could get up. So there I was, and I guess I went in and out, I don't really remember, but there I was on the landing, and I couldn't get up, and I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while, and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen, and he's watching TV, and maybe I'll be able to get up later, and I won't tell him that I was so foolish as to come up the steps and fall. So I lay there a little bit longer, and I woke up again, and I couldn't get up. So I just lay there, and I kept going in and out, and finally, sometime later, it was at least 30 minutes, he wandered by the door, and the door from the floor was up and down to the stairs. So he looked at me and said, what are you doing down there? And I said, I can't get up. And he said, well, that won't do. So he came down, and he tried to get me up. And I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done, but I couldn't move. So he said, we need to call the ambulance. And I said, oh, no, I'll be able to get up. And he said, we really ought to call the ambulance. And my next-door neighbor was a urologist, and his wife was a nurse. And I said, well, maybe you can call them. So he called them, and they came over. And the doctor looked at me, and he said, call the ambulance. So we called the ambulance. And then we called my daughter, who also lives in Lexington. And she met us at the hospital. She came to the house, and the ambulance came, and the fire truck came, and we got us. And they brought us down because I had a neck injury. Obviously, I couldn't move my neck, couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body. And they brought it in from each side. And these two big burly men working on either side of me, trying to get me up. And the landing wasn't all that wide. They finally got me up, and they didn't want me to move at all. So they carted me up the stairs. And I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about it ever since. They said to each other, she doesn't weigh as much as a six-pack. So this has been the joke of the whole thing. They got me up, and they were absolutely marvelous. On the way to the hospital, they kept telling me where they were, and it wouldn't be too much longer because I really was in pain. And I got to the hospital, and, of course, they called ahead. I went right through to critical care, and they were ready for me. And the rest of the night, I was in and out, but I had marvelous care. I had marvelous people who were professionals who were working with me all night long. And they kept trying to check and be sure I didn't have any brain damage, I didn't have any nerve damage, but I had a broken neck. The second cervical was broken. They had this cast on me. The minute that they were there, they had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital.

I think that was the fifth or sixth time I'd been in like four or five weeks, and for whatever reason that he doesn't know and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy, and I thought that was kind of unusual. I had a plane ticket to California, and so he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day, and he did find a surgeon who would, and went in for the colonoscopy, and they kind of put you out, and when I got up off the table, I said, well, did you find anything? And he said, yes, and I said, cancer, and he said, yes, and I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said, we'll talk about that Monday, and so Monday he explained to me the extent to what I had. He thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation, and so they scheduled the operation, believe it or not, two weeks down the road, and I said, then I'm going to California, I'm not going to sit around here and worry about this, you know, two weeks. I just couldn't believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer, they would schedule you two weeks down the road. The doctor called me that night and asked me some questions, and we thought that was really unusual. To have a doctor call you, that doesn't happen very often, and the next morning his nurse called me at 7 from the hospital, and they were doing surgery. She said, we can get you in Friday if you'll stay, and I said, well, if you can get me in Friday, then I'll stay, so I was scheduled for surgery Friday and had it, and they ended up taking my whole colon, although I had left enough to poke everything back up, which was very fortunate, but he thought he got it all, which, of course, is everybody's first question, and so anyway, I was in the hospital, I don't remember, I was on morphine and kind of out of it, had trouble, had a lot of trouble with my IV, and I was on, like I said, I was on morphine, so the IV thing kept going off, I guess because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on morphine, I guess, but anyway, they would let that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring. It was driving us on, I mean, they'd wait 15 minutes, and it's like a car door, you know, the ding, ding, ding, ding, and I swear every time I would want to sleep, that thing would wake me up. Well, after a day of that, I was ready to kill something, and they just would let it go, even though we'd call them or whatever, they'd just take their sweet time getting in there.

Unfortunately, the wife got very ill and died. And so they were very sad for a while. And eventually the father decided that he really wanted to marry again. So he went out into the city and found another woman that was interested in marrying him. So he chose to marry her. She had three daughters of her own who were just a little older than the young girl that the man had. And when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife, was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the gentleman's daughter, was really forced to do all the work in the house. And the daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day. And in fact, they made Cinderella sleep near the fireplace or next to the fireplace. And she ended up being covered with ashes from the fireplace. So they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her. Time went on and Cinderella's only friends really were the animals in the household. All of them, including the dog and cat and mice and even the rats, were her friends. And so time went on and they all grew older and they were in their probably late teens maybe when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman and the stepsisters were not quite so beautiful, partly because they were mean and nasty. So they lived in a kingdom with a king who lived in a palace in the center of the city. And he had a son and the king wanted his son, the prince, to marry. Well, the prince had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about. And the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the kingdom. So they decided to have a ball where all the young ladies of the kingdom would be invited and the prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he'd like to marry, they hoped. Everybody received an invitation. The stepmother received their invitation and was of course very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder. She was excited. The stepmother told the three stepsisters about the ball and they were excited. So everybody was running around getting all prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes. And finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball. And Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find something that she herself could wear. But of course she couldn't find much of anything great and so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the stepsisters laughed at her and said, you can't go to the ball looking like that.

The first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese, and everybody there spoke Japanese. So it was frustrating. I had put children in school. I had to take them shopping to get their uniforms. I had to take a taxi and tell them where I wanted to go and how to get home. So how did I deal with it? I studied Japanese every morning, five days a week, until I got so I could do it. It happened again when I went to Korea. It happened again when I went to Guatemala and Brazil, where they did not speak English. I spoke English in Jamaica and I spoke English in Malaysia at that time. But the only time that I really had what I call a serious communication problem is when I have been transported into a place where people don't speak my language, and I have to communicate. And I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time. And I find I do it by reading body language, reading facial expressions, and a lot of this moving hands to describe what I want. And then as the language picks up on my part, I have less of that to do. That's pretty much my experience with it. Were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared? Yes. Okay. What happened? Tell me the story, start from the beginning. Okay. I was on a boat, a ship I should say, and the USS President of mine was President Wilson. And we were sailing from I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my husband and my two youngsters were there. They were probably third and fourth grade. And we came in, we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up. So the captain notified us, there's a bit of weather out there, and so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon started, and the two of them met. And our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. I was, my children, one of them was thrown out of her bunk and hit her head on a washbasin. And we strapped them in something. I can't remember exactly because I was miserable. I was seasick, and I was on the prom deck. And they had storm windows up. Because the prom you're supposed to be able to see, but they had these bad weather, big thick windows up. And I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair, sick as I could be, watching the waves come up over me. And then I would hear crashing. And when we would go up real high, the ship would creak and go, and then go down. I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life. They had ropes for people, you know, if you had to go to the bathroom or something, you couldn't walk. So you would do this to try and find your way.

And that was, to me, it was probably the most difficult one that I had to deal with, not because I didn't understand him, but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him. But I also spent some time in Mexico, and there's people down there that speak no English, so I've had to adapt, and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish, enough to get by. Things like, gustan cerveza, or donde el ba\u00f1o, you know, the important stuff, you know. The beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun, Mexico, and we were, at the time, we'd been discussing this, and we were just standing in line at the movie theater, and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico, and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel, which we had planned to go see, you know, to go to the island of Cozumel and, you know, travel around there a little bit, because there's some ruins there, and it's a really nice place. Well, the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex-marine or something, he was just perfectly built. And he had, they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab, they'd gotten near the port, I think they were doing one of the princess cruises or something, so they'd come into port and had spent the day there, and then they had to get back to the ship. So they hired a cab. Well, the cab starts going the other direction. And he kept telling them, no, no, no, no, you're going the wrong way, the port's over here, you know, you need to go back this way. And he wouldn't stop. And he kept saying, not to worry, I know shortcut, it's okay. And he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop, and he and his wife just jumped out of the vehicle as it was moving, and people in the neighborhood that they had jumped out into started screaming about, yelling for the Federales because they knew that there was an abduction that was underway. So here we are, maybe a month away, not even a month away from our trip, and thinking about this, we get there to Cozumel, and as soon as you get off the ferry there's all these cab drivers there and wanting to take you around the city or around the island.

And so the prince is like, well, I guess we'll have this grand ball. And whoever I meet there and I fall for is who I'll end up marrying. So Cinderella had been working on this ball gown because they had received a letter that there was going to be this ball. And she was like, oh, my gosh, all my dreams can come true.

But unbeknownst to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores, using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that they had cast away because they didn't want it. So Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her. And while the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it, Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress, very happy to go. Then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things that they had cast away, and they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters. And she went out to the yard and was crying, and then the fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight. She made her very beautiful and all that, but she warned her it would only last till midnight. And she turned a pumpkin into a carriage and transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful. And so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince. And I guess it was love at first sight, and they were dancing together, and he very much enjoyed his time with her. And they were dancing outside, and she saw the clock, and she noticed it was almost midnight. So she went racing down the stairs, leaving one of her glass slippers behind. And she went racing off in the carriage, and she actually didn't make it quite home. And when it struck midnight and everything turned back to what it was, pumpkin, the carriage turned back into a pumpkin, and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers. And so this prince, after this happened, he was very interested in finding her. You know, he wondered why she had ran away. And so he set out to search for her using the glass slipper."}, {"filename": "NEURAL11-1_506812_746277.wav", "transcript": "And finally, the mom called the fire department because she didn't know how to get the dad or the cat out of the tree.

They are automatically going to advance after 30 seconds, but if you're ready to move on before 30 seconds, just say next and I'll go to the next slide. At the end, there will be an opportunity for you to review any slides if you wish to have extra time to look at any slides. And then I'm going to stop sharing my screen with you and have you retell the story of Cinderella without looking at the pictures. Okay, so we can go ahead and start. Just say next if you're ready to move on. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. All right. Do you want to go back and review any pictures or slides? No, thanks. All right. So now tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can. You can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it. Okay. So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters, but they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her stepsisters were very mean to her as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her stepsisters did. So one day they received an invitation from the palace that said the prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a princess. And the stepsisters were very excited about it and so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and stepsister said, oh, well you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years. And it was a beautiful dress and she was so excited because now she'd be able to go to the ball. And when her stepsister saw it, they tore it apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried and the stepsisters went off to the ball and along came Cinderella's fairy godmother. And she said, oh, well you can go to the ball. And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters and Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball. She danced with the prince and had a wonderful time, but remember that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were. So she, sorry, that was my dog."}, {"filename": "richardson20_1002968_1242433.wav", "transcript": "Wow, that's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. So what's he do? Like any sane person, he bends down and gives her a kiss. He's like, hey, maybe this will work. And she wakes up, and they get married, and they go off and live happily ever after. That was awesome. Like any sane person would do. Yeah, any sane person. You see a sleeping girl, nothing else works. I'd kiss her. I mean, you kiss her, one of two things are going to happen. She's either going to wake up and slap you. Well, one of three things. Wake up and slap you. Wake up and just be like, whoa, what happened? Or wake, just not wake up at all. You got three options. Hey, two of them are good. The third one, it's a little rough, but no worse off than it was before. Exactly. It didn't hurt anything. OK, so now I'm going to have you do the same thing with Little Red Riding Hood. Yeah, this is the nice one where, OK. All right. All right. And so remember, you can use anything that you remember, as well as the pictures from the book to tell a story. All right. So Little Red Riding Hood's at her house with her mom, and her mom's baking some muffins and bread and some snacks for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her granny. So she's out playing with the animals while her mom's doing that. And then she gets a basket from inside, and she's like, OK, well, I'm off to granny's. Well, while she's going off to her grandmother's, she gets a little sidetrack playing with the animals, and she runs into this wolf. And the wolf's like, hey, where are you going? She's like, well, I'm going over here to my granny's house. I got a basket full of goodies for her. So the wolf goes over and looks in the basket, and she's like, hey, leave that alone. That's not for you. And so the wolf's like, hmm, if I get there first, maybe I can get these goodies. So the wolf runs on ahead and gets to granny's house and knocks on the door, and granny comes and answers It's a wolf, so I mean, she runs off. She's scared. Well, the wolf's like, hi, I have an idea. And so he dressed up in one of granny's nightgowns and put on a sleeping cap and grabbed her glasses and crawled into the bed. And the Little Red Riding Hood gets to the door and knocks. And the wolf disguises its voice. It's like, come on in, sweetie. And so the Little Red Riding Hood's like, oh, OK, granny. And she opens the door and sets the basket down. She's like, granny, are you feeling OK? Yeah, sweetie. So she goes a little bit closer."}, {"filename": "NEURAL11-2_246799_486255.wav", "transcript": "Let me talk about when I went to Belgium as a cultural exchange student, which was I would say kind of life-changing. When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio. And I had the opportunity to travel as part of the International Foreign Youth Exchange, which is a 4-H associated organization. I was big in 4-H when I was young because I grew up in Ohio. So I grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity. Ohio, the state of Ohio, sends several people every year to go to a foreign country. And it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others. And it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up. So I always knew that I wanted to do that. And since I had taken French all through high school, I thought, I will go to a French-speaking country. And France wasn't available, but Belgium was. So I chose Belgium. And luckily, I got to go there. I soon found out that learning high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium. So it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well. Because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English. So I had to learn French. And that's the best way to learn it, I think. But when I say it was life-changing, it really kind of made me think about, first of all, that other people are not like us in the United States. And really got me thinking about how can I do what I do as a speech pathologist in other countries? So I immediately came home and interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist. And they said, well, you got to get your master's degree. Back then, you didn't have to have your master's degree in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my master's. And met my husband, got married, had children, that kind of thing. But it's always been something. I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full-time professor and did a lot of international work that way. So I was doing telepractice before it was cool, actually. And I got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and that kind of thing. So still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. I still keep in touch with some of my host families in Belgium. And we've hosted kids from other countries for other programs as well. So I think, and I always encourage my children, I hope they will get to, if not study abroad, then travel a little bit more than I did growing up. It just wasn't a big opportunity until I was in college when I was able to do it. Now these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them. Tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end. And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face. Take a look at these pictures that tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story also with a beginning, middle, and end. And you can look at these pictures as you tell your story.

Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold a ball and the household was invited to the ball so Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited but her sisters told her differently and furthermore they told her that she was not not only not invited but she was not appropriately dressed or could not did not have a dress that would suit the occasion so they left for the ball and Cinderella was very very sad but here comes the fairy the godmother fairy and says what would you like to do my child and she says I would like to go to the ball so but I don't have a dress and the fairy said no problem we're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand and Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes not only that but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball so she goes to the ball and impresses everybody including the the prince the king's son who falls desperately in love with her but the fairy had said you must be back by midnight or you're going to turn into pumpkin so Cinderella hurries back and makes it back before midnight but leaves behind a shoe so the prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry but where was she she would know what we see him so he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe and they had to find the person whom the shoe fit perfectly and they went through the sisters and even the mother tried her luck but the shoe would not fit and so no candidate was found to marry the prince until one of the animals told the surveyor that she should try it on Cinderella and when the surveyor did that the shoe fit the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly so the prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball and they lived happily ever after.

Her stepmother had two little girls that were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat and Cinderella had a dog and Cinderella thought everything could be good and her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up, the stepsisters really were not nice to Cinderella. They were evil stepsisters. They did things like they made her do all the chores, then throw things at her, then make her clean the floors, clean the cinders out of the fireplace, then make her take care of all the animals, including their cat and their cat didn't like Cinderella so that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were mice so that was kind of a tough thing to do. Now, Cinderella obviously was sad so every night she would go to her room and she'd look out her window and she could see in the distance, she could see the palace and she looked at the palace and says, oh, I wish I could go there someday just to see what it's like. So she just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king and his right hand man would go through and try to figure out what was needed because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well, he had a son who was a prince but the prince did not have a wife and he wanted the prince to have a wife before he would give him the kingdom. So they decided they would have a grand ball and invite the eligible young women from around the village and they sent out invitations to everybody and the stepmother got the invitation and was reading it and Cinderella read it over her back, over her shoulder and Cinderella thought, well, I'm a girl in the village, I get to go. And her stepmother didn't say anything but her stepsisters were, no way, you can't go. Gotta have a ball gown. So she did her ball gown. She didn't have a ball gown, that is. She went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of ball gowns that she could have and she talked to her friends, the mice, and they took a dress that she had and they put bows and frills on it and things like that and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need, I can go now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs where her mother and stepsisters were getting ready to leave and when they saw her dress, they were upset. One of the stepsisters ripped her dress and one of them ripped her necklace off of her and of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset."}, {"filename": "richardson21_1668821_1908210.wav", "transcript": "And Snow White thinks to herself, yep, I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all. And she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it, she just takes a bite. And then she collapses, and the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm gonna be real, the first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like, I can only, like, get a wedge out, and then from there I can take proper bites. But apparently Snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as inhuman beauty. So, anyway, she collapses, the apple rolls out of her hand. The crone cackles maniacally, as you are wont to do, and runs out. And then, I mean, I assume she, like, hobbles out because she's still a crone. Maybe she, no, she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway. But anyway, the old crone hobbles away. And all the dwarves come hi-hoing home, and they see Snow White passed out on the floor, and they're like, again? But then they realize that she's not breathing too well, or at all. And so, they get on the backs of deer, I think. Like, they ride deer to go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this crone. Presumably, she just leaves a really obvious trail. They follow her, and, I don't know, there's a lightning storm or something, I think? And the crone is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer. Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her, and they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car, specifically. And I believe it. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying. But anyway, antagonistic deer with tiny bearded men riding them. And so, she's understandably freaked out, and she climbs up onto this mountain, and she's trying to hang onto the edge because she's about to fall, and then lightning strikes the stick she's holding onto, and the ground beneath her feet crumbles, and she falls, presumably to her death. But probably not for sure, in case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development. They did that in Rapunzel in Tangled. Mother Goth is probably dead. Hope she's dead. She was scary. So, the evil queen, as the crone, falls to her death, and all the dwarves were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on Snow White. And so, they race back to Snow White, but she's still dead. And so, they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical, again, but this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin, and they're mourning her, and there are flowers and tears and three wildebeests crying, and suddenly, the prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion, and he says, what the heck? The pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm gonna kiss her, because that is the logical next step. So, then he proceeds to lay one on her, and she wakes up. I assume she just hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue, and he found the apple, and took it out of her mouth, and that was censored. That seems logical, because if he's gonna kiss a dead person, he may as well go all the way. Good thing to go home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so, she sits up, and thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her, because otherwise she would have hit her head on it, and probably knocked herself unconscious again, because she does that a lot."}, {"filename": "wright89a_571113_810501.wav", "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and she lived with her dad. Her mom had died years ago, so it was just her, herself, and her dad. And then one day, her dad remarried and brought a new mom with two stepsisters home to meet Cinderella. And Cinderella was so happy to get a new mom, because she missed her mom. Well, Cinderella and her dad really loved each other, and they were a family again with a new mom and two stepsisters. But then, Cinderella's dad died, and the stepmom was not a very nice mom, and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella. And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes, and scrub the floor, and make the beds, and make the food. And they would not let Cinderella be part of the family. And they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there. And she would look out her window, and she could see far beyond the city, the castle. And she would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would want to go and see. Well, meanwhile, there was the prince. And the prince wasn't married yet. And the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom. And so they decided to do a ball, which is a big dance. And they were going to make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in the town to come to the ball. And so the prince could pick one of the single girls to be his wife. And so they sent out invitations. And every home got an invitation for this big dance, and everybody was invited. And so the stepmother and the two stepsisters, they were so excited to go to this dance. And they were going to dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family, too. And the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you. You're shabby, and you don't have any clothes to wear. And the stepmother said, if you do all your chores, you can go. And oh, Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball. And so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball. And so they made her a dress, and oh, it looked so pretty. So the night of the ball, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball. And they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done. And here comes Cinderella, and she comes down the stairs, and she goes, oh, wait for me. I can go, too. And the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her, and they were appalled. They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear, and they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her, and they go, Cinderella, you can't go. Look at you. You look like a little merchant, and no prince would ever want to look at you. And so they said they were off to the ball."}, {"filename": "richardson22_537900_777280.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so the story of Cinderella is that her mom died, and her dad remarried this really, really mean woman who had these really, really terrible daughters. And so they all move in together, and I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money, or this old mean woman wouldn't be marrying him, but when she moves into the house, I hope that dad leaves because she is really, really mean Cinderella. So, Cinderella is... she's made to clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do, and so she's pretty much a slave. Again, I don't know where the dad is during all this, but... so she works for a long time because in the story, it showed her as a little girl, and then later on, it's like eight years later. So apparently, this happened for a long time. This girl is gonna need some help. So, she is still working for the family, and then she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such, and she looks out the window all the time, and then there's that castle, and she's like, oh, where other people live who I'm sure have a great life. So, then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the prince so he can find a wife. I don't know. This sounds very crazy if I'm saying it, but it's true. So, they have this dance so that prince can find a wife, and they invite everybody in the kingdom, and apparently, again, her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants, but her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come, but she thinks she's gonna come, so she gets to try on the outfits and stuff and sing songs, probably in the movie, and birds and things like that help her get ready, and then the stepsisters are like, you aren't going, and in the book, they take her necklace and terror dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top, but they do, but they're really mean, and so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubs a lamp in there. It's... maybe she read a book. I don't... I don't remember that part, but anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years. So, she asked her fairy godmother, I guess, to go to the dance. I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. Like, this is a pretty crappy situation. I don't think that, like, one night is gonna help, but anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So, the fairy godmother, like, gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up, and then puts her in a pumpkin and sends her away. So, she gets to go to the dance, and it looks like she had a nose job. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much, much smaller, and her hair is much, much blonder when she goes to the dance. So, something happened, and she gets dressed up, and she goes to the dance, and lo and behold, the prince falls in love with her. And so, then she knows she has to be back by midnight, because that's when her terrible sisters, I guess, are getting home, and the pumpkins, and all the things that are happening. So, anyway, she runs away, and she runs her shoes off, which, her last shoes, anyway. I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken them off 15 minutes after getting there. So, she lost her shoe, and then all the prince knows is that girl that he loves wore this shoe. So, he sends his lackey guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe, and it's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this shoe."}, {"filename": "wright82a_28630_267990.wav", "transcript": "A little girl's cat got free and got up in a tree and got on a limb where it couldn't get down, and apparently it's a father who went up to save the cat, and he got stuck on a limb, and they had to call the fire department to come and rescue him while the dog's barking up the tree at the father, and the father's ladder is laying on the ground where it should be up against a tree.

The dog doesn't seem any pleasing to please that he's up the tree. And it looks like someone had to call the fire department to get the ladder to get the cat and dad down. So what I have for you first is I have pictures from the Disney storybook version of Cinderella that we're gonna go through just to let you kind of refresh your memory about this version. Afterwards, I'll take the pictures away and you can tell me the story of Cinderella as you know it. It does not have to be this Disney version. The pictures are just here to help kind of jog your memory about a few things. So we'll go through the pictures first. Just let me know when you are ready to see the next picture and we'll move on. Okay. Okay. Okay. I forgot about those guys, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. Okay. Okay. Okay. And they lived happily ever after. And there's my little Gus, my little Gus Gus. You know the names, I love it. Would you like to see any of those pictures again? I don't think so. Okay, then let me stop sharing, give it back over to you. Okay, so at this time, I'd like you to tell me as much as you remember about the story of Cinderella using any details that you already know. You have stepmother with her two girls and then Cinderella and her father. I guess something happened to him, that one I don't remember, but Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters. Those sisters are jealous of her. And let's see. In comes, Cinderella spends a lot of time by herself."}, {"filename": "UNH1043_1247277_1486602.wav", "transcript": "The game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other, and points in this sport are called runs. The way that the playing field is set up is there's a diamond and there's four bases at each point of the diamond. The diamond is on one point in such that the bottom point is called home plate, and then going counter-clockwise around the clock, there's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate. The team that is in the field and is on defense, they're allowed to have gloves, and there's a ball that is in play. The other team that is trying to score the runs at that point has a bat, and they have some protective equipment, including helmets and such. The way that the game starts is one team is on defense, so they take the field, and there's certain positions for each player. There's nine active players per side, so the defensive team has nine players out in the field. The offensive team has one bat player that starts at home plate, called the batter. The team that is in the field first is the visiting team to the stadium, the home team. The visiting team bats first, the home team is on the field first. The way that the game is set up, there are nine, what are called, innings, and an inning consists of where each team gets to bat once, so if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, the visiting team bats until they get what are called three outs, and then they switch sides, where the home team then comes to bat, and the visiting team then is in the field, and then they get three outs. Once both teams have their three outs, that is one inning, and you do nine of those sets. In the defensive position, there are several different positions. There are nine positions. One of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher, and then at home plate is the catcher, and then we go around, we go up a first baseman, a second baseman, a third baseman. There is someone that stands between third and second base, called a shortstop, and then beyond the diamond is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out, and their goal, the defensive goal is to... There's two ways you can make an out. You can catch the ball in the fly... Actually, three ways to make an out, no. Catch the ball in the fly if the batter hits the ball, and the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate if the batter hits it. If the batter hits the ball and someone in the field catches it before it hits the ground, that is one out. There's something called balls and strikes, where if the batter misses with his bat and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the actual physical base at home plate, that's called a strike. If it's outside that lateral movement, it's called a ball, you get three strikes or the batter is out, or if you get four balls, then the batter gets a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out. If the batter makes it to first base before the throw gets there, he is safe on first base."}, {"filename": "capilouto42a_612000_851310.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella's dad got remarried, and so she acquired not only a stepmother, but two stepsisters who were kind of ugly. And they were pretty mean to Cinderella. So Cinderella did spend a lot of time with the animals outside, besides working, sweeping up cinders and cleaning the house and doing things for her stepsisters who seemed to spend a lot of time on their looks, looking in the mirror and fixing themselves up. One day they all had an invitation from the prince to go to a ball at the castle. So, of course, Cinderella was not going to be allowed to go. She didn't have the clothes to do it, but the ugly stepsisters were dressed up and the stepmama was too, and they all left for the ball. Cinderella was sad, but she accepted it, and along came her fairy godmother. And her fairy godmother brought out her magic wand and tapped different things. Pumpkin turned into a coach, and the mice turned into, I don't know, carriagemen. I don't know what they're called. And Cinderella had a beautiful gown and pretty glass slippers, and then they all went to the ball. And the only stipulation was that at midnight she would have to return to her Cinderella state. So she went to the ball, and the prince and Cinderella danced, and he was very taken with her, with not only her beauty, but her manners. She was a very sweet person. And she looked up at the clock, and the clock was getting ready to strike midnight. So she ran down the stairs and lost one of her slippers, her glass slippers, and returned to her house where she was again clad in her old clothes. And the carriagemen returned to their mice and pumpkin status. And when her stepmama and stepsisters came home, they were raving about the ball that they had gone to, and Cinderella didn't say that she had gone. So she went back to her normal life. In the meantime, the prince was trying to find Cinderella. She had disappeared so rapidly, and he wanted to be able to see her again. So he sent out on a search for her with his manservants, and they came to, I don't know what her stepmother's name was, but they came to their home. And the ugly stepsisters, of course, thought that they would fit into the glass slippers, and whoever did was going to, of course, be part of the prince's life. So they couldn't fit into it, and he went out. And Cinderella was outside, and he stopped to try it on Cinderella, and lo and behold, the slipper fit. So Cinderella and the prince were married, and went away from the stepmother and stepsisters, and lived happily ever after."}, {"filename": "NEURAL5-2_896413_1135721.wav", "transcript": "Ferdinand was sitting in isolation in his home because it was during the coronavirus pandemic when all of a sudden the soccer ball came through the window, knocked over the lamp beside him.

But Bennett said, no, mom, it's not raining outside. I don't need an umbrella. He refused to take the umbrella. She said, you're gonna need this later on. She wasn't happy with him, but he refused and said goodbye. Well, as he was walking to school, sure enough, it started to rain. By the time he got to school, he was pretty wet and he spent the day drying out his shoes in school and he got his chair wet, but it all dried out eventually. But by the time he was ready to come home, it was not only raining, it was pouring and there were puddles on the sidewalk. He stepped into all those puddles. He ran in the rain to get home as fast as he could. By the time he got home, he was drenched and his mother could not help herself. She said, I told you so, Bennett. Bennett felt bad about that and knew that his mother was right. So the next day, when it was still raining, he took his umbrella to school. We're gonna look at one more picture that you're going to look at, take as long as you need and then tell me a story about what you see with the beginning, a middle and an end. One day, Hannah was out riding her tricycle and as she was riding her tricycle, she, what happened? Oh yeah, okay, she was riding her tricycle, but she was chasing after her cat. Her cat had run out and run down the street, but she got out of the car and she was chasing her cat off her tricycle because the cat not only had run down the street, the cat ran up the tree and her cat would not come down. Well, pretty soon she called for her dad and her dad got out the ladder. Her dad started climbing up the ladder. He climbed up the tree trying to get the cat, but while he was sitting on the tree trying to reach the cat, their dog came running out into the yard and knocked the ladder over, barking, barking, barking up the tree at dad. So then not only could dad not reach the cat, but dad couldn't get down because the dog had knocked over the ladder.

If anything happens, I can hold it over my head and I won't get as wet. So I'm not going to take the umbrella, I'll be fine.

The story of Cinderella, once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was a young girl whose parents had died. She had an aunt, but her aunt was a very bitter person. So she and the children, her children, her daughters, were living in the house, but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemate. She had to keep the house cleaned up no matter what. As she grew older, she grew more and more beautiful, but even as beautiful as she was, she was still just the housemate. The other girls grew up, they weren't near as beautiful as she was. In the meantime, the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married and to do that he wanted to have a great ball. He sent out invitations to all the influential people within the land that they could attend the ball. Cinderella's mother had gotten the invitation and had decided to send her two daughters. Cinderella said, well, can I also go, and her mother said, no you can't, you're to stay here and keep this place clean. So while she was doing that, she became a little bit disconcerted and all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once. Her fairy godmother came to see her and she asked what she really wanted and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball. So her fairy godmother waved her wand and gave her the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear. To take her off to the ball she had to have a coach.

This can be a happy story, sad, from any time, childhood up until more recently, just something important that happened that you could tell me a story about. And you can take time to think if you'd like. I was gonna say, cause I'm gonna try not to tell you the same story. Those were two injury stories. What was important? As soon as I hang up from you, I'll go, why didn't you tell her that? What is important? Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries or life stopping moments as I have when that hit last January. And she had called me, not feeling well, not feeling well, not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU Health. That went on for a period of, I don't know, four or five days or so. And, oh my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that, I'm not sure who was gonna bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work. She had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to, I guess Jackie was still there at that point and Mark. And when I called her, she was low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the ER, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get intravenous. Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth if that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not. And Mark did take her to the ER. They did release her. It wasn't long after that IU then found stuff that said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying. And then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know you know that they need you. So it was the decision whether to hop a plane that night. And I decided not to. Yes, Jackie, it was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day. And we were in the doctor's office altogether. Jackie was our chauffeur for the entire time. We were in the doctor's office and he admitted her into the hospital for that night. And the surgery was the following night. I did go home the first night, but I spent the night at the hospital on the second night, which I was glad that I did because she was with it, but not really with it. But staying there with her for a few days afterwards, she was a trooper, but none of my children have really been sick. So to be so far away and not be able to be there immediately.

She had to stay back and do the cleaning, continue to do the cleaning. She really wanted to go, and she was doing the cleaning, and she imagined that if she did go, it would somehow catch her. I don't remember that scene. She's still doing the cleaning, and then she gets delivered an invitation to go, but it doesn't apply to her, the wicked stepmother.

A couple days later, her mom, my oldest daughter got it. And lo and behold, the day that we had tickets for Jesus Christ superstar, I got this stomach virus. And it was, you didn't know you had it until you were losing things from your body. And it just knocked you completely for a loop. So I was already mad enough being sick, but to miss a play was even worse. So I laid in bed and about 7.15, 15 minutes after it started, I was feeling a whole lot better. But yeah, there was, couldn't go, could not go to the play. And then by morning I was back to work. So yeah, it was just a day deal. Not even quite 24 hours. Oh, that was my last illness. Yes, my youngest daughter, this was a year ago. She was a senior in high school and quite an athlete. And it was track season and she's a good runner, a good high jumper. And we were at a meet that had kind of old equipment and she did her high jump and the mat spread and she fell, landed on her back, legs up over her and her head was cocked up. And it just was too much for me. She said, I'm fine, I'm fine. The next day I took her to a chiropractor that we know. And she kept saying she was fine. And apparently with this injury, she was. But then that next day then, after he had kind of adjusted her and said that everything really truly is fine. She got very ill and she wound up having mono. And it was the worst case the pediatricians and the chiropractors said they had seen in many, many years. She was, I've never seen. I don't know any children that have had cancer. So I mean, I'm not trying to compare it with that because you do get over this. But I've never seen one of my kids that ill, that sick. They didn't think she'd graduate, let alone get back to track or even start ASU in the fall. I mean, it was, she was down. And just the pain, you get all this stuff in your neck and just won't you, she's gonna look like Frankenstein. It was very scary, very, very scary. But I credit, well, God and the chiropractor was, he did a lot of immune stuff. She did graduate. She was able to finish school. She got to state because she had already qualified before she got sick and actually medaled, not in all the events she wanted to, but she did get to do her high jump."}, {"filename": "NEURAL38-2_993994_1233234.wav", "transcript": "Hmm. What was the last? The last big sailing adventure. It's not all that important, but in 2011 was the last time we had the opportunity to go on a sailing trip in the Caribbean. I was in the Bahamas this time with friends from the Sailing Club. And we met, well, the month of February has broken into three 10-day shifts where people would meet at the boat and a few people were there for the whole month because they were retired and had enough time and money to do it. But the rest of us were there for 10-day periods. And we met the boat at the Paradise Atlantis, Paradise Island Resort in Nassau in the Bahamas. And so we were on the boat for 10 days. And by the time we got back, I mean, by the time our time was over, we were back in Fort Lauderdale where the boat had been rented. And it was a real fun trip. We did a lot of snorkeling. The water is just absolutely beautiful. And most of the Bahamas, the water is only about less than 20 feet deep. So as you're sailing to the next place, and we didn't always know where we're going to drop anchor and hang out for the night sometimes in just some totally uninhabited area or sometimes near an island where it could go to shore and explore the shore and go to a restaurant. I've been on other trips like this before, but this one was really good. It was a catamaran, which is like two sailboats stuck together with a big cabin in between. And we got into some storms at night where we were just bouncing around like crazy all night. We ate a lot, drank a lot, snorkeled a lot, got a lot of great underwater pictures, barracudas and things. The very last night of the trip, me and the captain, this is a guy who we'd all met at our sailing club because when he was living in Bloomington working on a journalism degree. Then he moved back to Florida and he arranged us renting the boat for the month. And he'd grown up in Florida and the Bahamas and knew the area pretty well. But it was also a real character and he was in his 30s going on 20s at one of the people because he was kind of goofy. You never know what to expect from him.

But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off, so nothing worked. And so we walked 18 blocks back to our hotel. And in San Francisco, you know it's pretty hilly. And so, I mean, it was quite a jaunt back there. And they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel. So we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was we were concerned about Mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there. And we wanted to also call our two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called Mother, who never watches news. She doesn't like to hear the bad news, and there's hardly any good news that's told. So we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know. But my sister said, Mother, what are you doing? And she said, well, I'm watching the news because so-and-so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco. So it was a lot of fear at the beginning. We were on the 19th floor, so we had to walk up to the 19th floor and then walk down with our luggage. So it was just the fear of the unknown."}, {"filename": "capilouto20a_449616_688743.wav", "transcript": "Okay, there was once a little girl, Cinderella, her mother died, and she only had her father left to live with, and her father remarried. The woman he married had two other daughters. The stepmother made Cinderella do all the housework and cleaning while her two daughters just sit around and enjoy themselves and ate. So then there was to be a dance where the prince was going to maybe find a mate to marry. So the two daughters, the two stepdaughters, two stepsisters, were planning to go to the dance. The whole countryside was invited to this dance where the prince would be looking for a wife, and Cinderella was kept busy doing work around the house, couldn't go to the dance because she had too much work to do. She was upstairs cleaning in the attic, and she found this beautiful pink dress. She put it on to see how it looked on her. Well, the stepsisters found her in that dress, they took the dress away, they tore it off of her, took it away. And the stepmother put her back to work scrubbing floors and whatever. Well, the stepsisters got ready to go to the dance, and a fairy godmother appeared. She asked Cinderella if she wanted to go, and she helped Cinderella. She used her magic wand, and a pretty dress appeared. Her hair was done, she had gloss slippers on, and a coach with masks came to get Cinderella to take her to the dance. When she got to the dance, oh, but she had to be home by midnight. And when she got to the dance, the prince asked Cinderella to dance, and then it was time for her to go home. So she had to rush out to get into the carriage, the pumpkin carriage, to go home, but she lost her gloss slipper. So she got on in home, and the prince found the gloss slipper, and that was the lady, that was the princess, the girl he wanted to marry. So he went out, he told his dad that, so they started searching the countryside to see if they could find the girl that was there, and they took the slipper with them, and they thought that whoever they found that the slipper would fit was the princess that he wanted to marry. So they went out, but when the prince came to Cinderella's house, only the two stepsisters got to try on that.

Um, I, I wasn't nervous to have a baby, uh, except that she came so fast. And when I, she came on her due date, which is precisely who she is. And I got to the hospital and had, was already, you know, at like eight or something, so there were very few options for me except to just have the baby. And I did. And I just remember her coming out and, uh, looking like a little monchichi, which is a toy from when I was younger and she was so brown. Her hair was so brown and she had this brown hair all over and I had light hair and her dad has light hair. Uh, so it was just pretty incredible to see this, this little baby with all this brown hair. Um, anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just don't, it doesn't go away. I remember what I was wearing when I got there. I remember where I was sitting in the car. I remember the stoplights we went through. I remember the path to the hospital. I remember everything about it. And then bringing her home, nothing was the same ever again. So it's like you re I remember every detail and then my whole world just, you know, she was always there then. And then it was like, she was never not there. And then her brother, um, I was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have grace because she, like I said, came so fast. And when I got to the hospital, there was nothing to do except have this baby. And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember. Uh, my gynecologist, like, you know, you had a very quick first born. This is going to happen again. And I sat, I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks. And all I could think was, when is this going to happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain going to come back? And, um, that's not how it worked at all. Actually. I, he was also born on his due date. So now we've determined it's me who has to have things in the right place. Um, but we rode to the hospital. I checked myself in. It was so calm. It was the exact opposite. And he came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face. And I just remember thinking, you know, there are so many times when people say, you know, no, two kids are alike or boy, girl, two boys, two girls doesn't matter. Like they were completely different. They are still completely different, but they are the best things I have. Like I look at my life and that's it. It's them. So that's my most, I guess, my most important story in two parts. I'm going to show you these pictures. Take a little time to look through these pictures. They do tell a story.

Well, one day she was looking out at the hill and she saw the beautiful castle up on the hill. And she dreamed about what it would be like to live in a castle someday, but she had to go back to all her work, more cooking, more cleaning, but she was such a nice and gentle person that all the animals loved her and flocked to her. All the mice and the horses and the dogs and the cats, everyone loved her so much. Well, up at the castle there was a Prince and the King who was the Prince's father decided it was time for the Prince to get married. So he and his advisors decided to have a ball for the Prince to meet all the eligible women in the kingdom so he could pick his bride. So they sent out invitations to the whole country for everyone with eligible brides or girls to come to the ball. Cinderella's house got an invitation too. And everybody was so excited. Both stepsisters thought it would just for sure be her that the Prince would choose. So they used Cinderella to help them get ready and get their dresses, get everything ready. And Cinderella wanted to go too, but she didn't have time to get herself ready. But she, so the animals got ready for her. They made her a dress and did her hair and got her all ready to go. And she ran downstairs to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go. She said that only girls, only the stepsisters could go. And she ripped Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was so upset. She went back to her room and she cried and she cried. And lo and behold what appeared, but her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother said, Cinderella, you can go to the ball. And she used magic to make her a new dress and to turn the mice in a footman and to turn the pumpkin into a carriage. And off she went to the ball in the brand new dress that the fairy godmother had made by magic for her. Especially important was she was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet. So she went to the ball and the minute she entered the ball, the Prince had eyes for no one but Cinderella and they danced and they danced and they danced and they had a wonderful time. But then the clock struck midnight and the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight. So the clock started striking midnight and Cinderella had to run before the Prince saw that she wasn't really a princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella. She ran down the stairs to her carriage and hopped in just in time before the magic went away. But she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home and the Prince was sad, but he knew he had her glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside for whosoever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fit it would become his bride. And they went around and no one's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to Cinderella's house. Both stepsisters tried, but their feet wouldn't fit. Finally they tried it on Cinderella and her foot fit perfectly. And she and the Prince got married and lived happily ever after. The end. And I keep talking. Can you tell me how you'd make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Well, being the methodical OCD person that I am, first, I get everything out on my counter. I get out the bread, I get out the peanut butter.

He always had a, his sinuses were always a mess. So we kind of thought it was that, you know, he's vomiting, mostly in the morning, in fall of 2010. And so we, he went on antibiotics, got a little bit better. So we thought everything was okay. You know, after a week or so, it started to go badly. Again, we took him back to the pediatrician who ordered a CT scan of his sinuses, but also just, he said, as a kind of as a throwaway, like defensive medicine almost, almost get a CT of his whole head. So I took him to Bloomington Hospital for the CT. On the way, we were listening to Judas Priest. And he asked me if that was Iron Maiden, which seems silly, but it was the first time he recognized the style of music, which was the new wave of British heavy metal. And the operatic vocals that are consistent between the two of them. So that was awesome. We get into the CT scan, he does it. The phone rings out in the waiting room, and it's the radiologist. And first he says, who is this? And I tell him, it's like, what? I didn't mean to talk to you. He was trying to call the pediatrician. And inadvertently actually got me. It was clear that he didn't want to break, in retrospect, it was clear that he want to break the news. Pediatrician called back and then said that they'd found a three and a half centimeter tumor in the back of his head. So, and that he should go to Riley the next day. And about, I don't know, less than 30 minutes later, he called back and said, I spoke to the surgeon at Riley. He wants to see him now. So we just had to pack up stuff, take him to Riley. He underwent brain surgery the next day. We were, prior to brain surgery for cancer, they prior to brain surgery for cancer, they took us out for the consent. And the residents telling me about this potential complication called posterior fossa mutism, which is a rare complication based on the location of the tumor. And that in rare cases, it meant that he wouldn't be able to speak for a little while afterward. I mean, which is funny, not funny. I mean, he has to get consent, but like, what choice do you have? Well, I don't want him to not have to speak for a little while. So I'm just going to let him have cancer in his brain. It'll be fine. What could go wrong? So, you know, he did, he does it. What I learned was that posterior fossa mutism was just kind of an old, archaic almost way of describing a part of a larger spectrum of things called posterior fossa mutism, posterior fossa syndrome, which is more than mutism."}, {"filename": "UMD20_283809_522884.wav", "transcript": "Okay, Cinderella's father married for the second time when Cinderella's mother had died and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her clean the fireplaces, hence the name Cinderella, and do other menial work. At some point the prince of the whatever principality it was, was in need of a wife, said his father and the, I don't know, minister of whatever, marriages, so they cooked up a scheme to have a ball and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality. Cinderella got one but she, of course, did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation, but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with white horses and a footman and so forth. So she was able to go to the ball but the provision was that she must, must leave at midnight. She went to the ball and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love. Midnight came and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she had to be out of there. So she hurried away and in her hurrying she lost one slipper, which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her. She was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth, but she managed to get home anyway. Later the prince was very depressed. He had fallen in love with this woman and she had disappeared. All he had left was a glass slipper and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else. So his father, who I guess was the king and the minister of marriages, went from house to house with the prince, with the glass slipper, and made every eligible young woman try it on. Of course it would not fit anyone at all, including the two unpleasant stepsisters. Even though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to try to fit in, but it still didn't work and it got blood all over the place. But finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper, Cinderella, and of course she was just a slady, but he insisted that she try it on."}, {"filename": "NEURAL24-2_231528_470547.wav", "transcript": "Um, I work, I'm an, um, educational aid in a special needs preschool classroom. So I deal with three, four and five year olds that have, um, delays in either physical behavior, um, speech is one of the big ones. I have, um, 22 kids and probably 16 of them have speech delays of some kind. Um, the majority of them are language delays and we work with them a lot. So we work, I work for these kids every day. We have a licensed speech therapist that comes in once a week and teaches a lesson, and then we follow up on whatever she wants us to do the rest of the week. So, um, our language kids, we really work hard with them on questions, pronouns, you know, adjectives, um, adverbs on, off, under, over, and that's a lot of just talking to them and using the correct language and using, getting them to mimic what we want them to say. So they, it just becomes natural and wrote with them. Um, we have our severe kids with, um, speech delays, which are their phonetics, their sounds, um, I mean, I wouldn't call them severe. They're in the middle. So we work a lot with stopping them every time they're, they're saying something incorrectly and, and prompting them to do either modeling or prompting them to say the correct thing, the right sound and doing a lot of the, you know, tongue up, mouth open, back in, you know, make it, you know, back in your throat sound. Um, and then our severe cases are, we have, um, two children with autism and one child that was born, um, addicted to crack. And, um, the, the boy that was born addicted to one of the autistic kids are, are typical autistic kids. They're, they're very, um, low verbal kids. So we're just working with them on environmental sounds and, um, becoming aware that I'm in their space and part of their world and to associate sounds and communication as a way to get me to do something for them. Um, we're working a lot on, uh, on recognizing that a sound means me and a sound means them, um, are, are crack, crack baby. That's not a good way, but that's what I'll call him. Cause I'm not going to use his name, but he has, um, physical issues too. He, um, he's a drooler. I mean, so we work with him a lot on physically, you know, reminding him to shut his mouth and, you know, focus. And, um, there's a lot of, a lot of rote work with him also, but there's a lot of trying to get him to mentally focus on, it's a lot of just rote training and repetition and over and over and over. And, and sometimes we see results and sometimes it takes forever and we don't see anything, but that's how it is. Can you tell me what's okay. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad or from any time, um, from when you were a kid or more recently. Story or the different story from what you told last week. Just make sure if it's the same story, you tell it as if I've never heard it. I'm going to tell you a different story. Okay. When about 1999, I took my kids sledding up in Troy, Ohio, which is just North of here. Um, my son was five and my daughter was three. So my husband went to, and we were sledding and we were having a good time on the levee, which is a small hill, but just about right for a five year old."}, {"filename": "NEURAL26-2_156567_395577.wav", "transcript": "Okay. Um, I will say most recently, my mom has developed Parkinson's disease. And, um, you know, at first she's been fine through it all. And it's not like she has tremors like Michael J. Fox. She just, um, she kind of has like the bobbing of the head and whatnot. And she's very emotional, which she never was before. So it's kind of like, you never know if you say, I think it's going to rain today, if that will make her cry or not. So, um, what I have found with her, um, whereas we have always, she doesn't live in my same time town. So we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything. And without physically seeing her face, I have to like start the conversation slow and see where she's at and her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues, or if this conversation will just be about nothing, you know? So I've had to do a lot more, um, listening to her and listening to the cues versus, um, normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, Oh my gosh, this happened today. And you just start rambling. But I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy, that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her. So she takes it all to heart. So for me, I just, I've really had to kind of let go of part of our relationship because I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's going to upset her or not. And it's sad. But so getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody because she doesn't do FaceTime or anything, which to me that would be a clear indication. I can read her face a lot better. But so asking the right questions and just listening a lot more. I'd like you to think about something important that happened in your life. And I would like you to tell me a story about this event. Um, it can be happy or sad from childhood up to now. Anything that stands out in your mind that you would like to tell a story about? Okay. Um, okay. I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. Um, I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy, so I really don't go to the doctors. I don't like to go to doctors. And that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I just, I didn't read a lot about it. I just went through it because I mean, I was fine the whole way. And then when we got to the hospital, I didn't, I had to be induced. So, I mean, I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know what I was signing up for. But, um, when we walked into that hospital, I mean, I got panicked because I didn't know anything. And, um, my mom was there and she came up and, um, she saw my doctor. And I remember the first thing she said, she goes, your doctor's as old as you are. And she was, she was only like a couple of years older than me, but I really didn't think anything about it. And, um, then I started getting nervous. I thought, well, I wonder how many babies she's still."}, {"filename": "richardson21_1189250_1428260.wav", "transcript": "Like, she doesn't know what to do with her arms. Anyway, so Snow White is working as a servant, and the evil queen goes up to the mirror and says, mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says, still Snow White, that hasn't changed. And so the evil queen is kind of upset. I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger productively by finding out what else the magic mirror can do, because that seems like a very narrow-minded and not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror. Anyway, she's insecure, we've discussed this. So at this point, the queen says to herself, well, I guess I can't do anything, gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so dang lonely, and she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life, she's wishing for the one she loves, even though I'm not sure she has a true grasp of what that would actually entail. But basically, one day, she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet. She's kind of creepy, he comes out of nowhere, so she's like singing to herself, I'm wishing, I'm wishing for the one I love, today! And then creepy prince comes in and goes, today! Out of nowhere, and it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet, but then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life, and she's terrified, rightly. And so the prince goes away, and she goes back to her lonely life, and this is the point at which the queen is like, well clearly I need to kill her, this is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this huntsman, and says, huntsman, you're gonna kill Snow White, you're gonna bring me her heart as proof. I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart, and it would look like Snow White's, it's not like Snow White has a Sonon label that says property of Snow White on her heart, but that's not the point, the queen is clearly a little bit few fries short of a happy meal. So the huntsman goes out, and he chases Snow White a little bit through the woods, and then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure he could never kill her, and so he falls to his knees in supplication, and he says, I'm so sorry, and he drops the knife, and Snow White's like. And then he says, run away, and I will cover for you, but you better run away and never come back, because the queen is gonna kill you. And so, if my memory serves me, the huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest, and he brings the heart of a wild boar to the queen, and says, look, queen, this is Snow White's heart. Heart of a wild boar doesn't look like a human heart, the queen is stupid, basically. And the queen says, ah, yes, cook that into a meal for me, and then she proceeds to eat this boar heart, thinking that it's Snow White's, which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids, I don't know about you. So, Snow White has fled into the forest, there are creepy trees that are grabbing for her, and she's making weird faces again, and eventually, she makes it to this cottage, where she breaks in, breaking and entering, also a common theme in these stories. She breaks in, and she sees, it's kinda dusty and kinda gross, but she sees all in a little row, a bunch of little beds, for people who are maybe three feet tall, if that, and she says, well, I'm gonna crash in one of those beds later, I guarantee it."}, {"filename": "richardson198_23685_262676.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so a boy was playing outside and when he kicked his soccer ball, it went through someone's living room window and crashed into a man who was relaxing on his chair.

Take a look at all of them, and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. The mother was trying to get her child to take an umbrella because she knew it was going to rain today. However, the little kid decided not to go to school with an umbrella because he didn't think he would need it. But then it started raining, and the poor little boy ran home to mom all wet, and sadly asked for an umbrella when she was upset at him for not taking it in the begin with. And then he walked to school with an umbrella. Okay. Now take a look at this picture. Take a look at everything that's going on, and again, tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.

But even though those things helped me physically feel better, the thing that I remember about when I started to feel better, like really feel better is it was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff stickers. And we had sticker books and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers. And I focused on my sticker book instead of the chicken pox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the kind of itching and scratching. And it put me in a better mood. So I wasn't as lethargic and I got better. Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? And if so, please tell us what problems arose and what you did to work through it. You may begin. There's so many people I have a difficult time communicating with. Let's see, I think that last time I talked about a coworker. Today, I'm gonna switch it up. Let's walk through this one. Okay, so I have a teenage daughter. And I know that they say that teenagers can be difficult to communicate with in general. But she also has a personality type that is very private. And I would say she withholds communication, withholds things, not out of lying or any ill will or anything bad. She just only gives as much information as she thinks other people need to have.

And so, anyway, so that's the way it went all the time, it was continual, there was nothing she could do about it, but she enjoyed the animals, you know, the dog and the cat and the mouse, and she was just a very nice young lady, did what she was supposed to do. And then there was a ball coming up that they were all invited to, the whole family, but the stepmother wouldn't let her go. She said she had to stay home and clean the fireplace and do chores, and if she could not go, it didn't matter. So the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and, you know, were getting all ready to go to it, she got really sad, she was very sad, very, very sad. And then, so the stepmom and the two stepsisters left to go to the ball, and this was a princess ball, it was actually a king's ball, but I mean, you know. And so she went outside, and I believe she was probably crying, and then, like a fairy godmother came along and was sitting down in the garden and everything, and was talking to her and says, you know, do you want to go, we'll make it so you can go, and everything, I'll fix everything with my magic wand. Anyway, and so she pointed her wand at Cinderella, and she had this beautiful dress that, you know, appeared on her, beautiful shoes, and her hair, and the little, I can't think of what that thing is, tiara, and everything, and then she, they went outside and they turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses, and it was like a pumpkin carriage. And everything for her to go, and, you know, so she got in the carriage, and, but the fairy godmother said, you have to be back by 12 midnight, you have to be back, don't be late, you have to be back. She said, okay, I won't, I won't, and she was all excited, and she looked so beautiful and everything, and she was going to have a good time, and they went out to the ball at the king's palace and all that, and then she met the prince, and they danced, and they just really, really liked each other very, very much, you could tell. So, and everything, so she was out dancing and talking to them and stuff like that, and then it rang at 12 midnight, and she said, I gotta go, I gotta go, and he said, don't go, don't go, I don't want you to go, and she, you know, ran down the steps to get to her, you know, coach, and she dropped one shoe, they were like glass slippers, and so she dropped one and he picked it up, and then she was gone, you know, I mean, she had to get home and everything turned back to normal. And she was just to herself while she was doing her chores and that, you know, thinking about that, and talking to her little animals, little mouses and stuff, and everything came knocking at the door, and it was the prince and the people from the palace."}, {"filename": "richardson197_30270_269242.wav", "transcript": "Um, a boy kicked a soccer ball.

And so they planned a great ball, which is a big, big party with lots of dancing and music and people. And they sent out a herald, that is, a messenger who told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come, all the single young women, because they had to be old enough to get married, to come to this big, fancy party in their prettiest dresses. And so the stepmother heard about this and was very, very excited, because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince. And she plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get. Meanwhile, poor Cinderella wasn't going to get to go. Her stepmother said, no, you have to help me get the girls ready and dressed, and then you have work to do. You have to keep this house clean. You have to make sure that it is spick and span when the prince comes to claim his bride. Poor Cinderella. After the girls and their stepmother left for the ball, she sat and sat and cried.

When Cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house and there was a stepmother and the stepmother had two daughters. The father dies and the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children, her two daughters, and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid, so to speak. So Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and all of that. And then the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella. And then comes the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for there to be a dance and everybody is all looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the perfect outfit and Cinderella is not going to go to the ball and she is at home and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot. I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in a hope chest, I guess what I would call it now, a hope chest, and so that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing. So the sisters go to the ball and poor Cinderella is home with her mice and the fairy goddess godmother makes her first appearance, I believe. So the fairy godmother creates the carriage to take her in and the horsemen and the dress and everything is perfect and her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball.

She takes their breath away."}, {"filename": "UNH1042_1138858_1377778.wav", "transcript": "Alright, so Cinderella starts when her father marries the evil stepmother, and Cinderella is joined into this new family, and then the father mysteriously disappears for some reason. Probably killed or murdered or maimed for his money, assuming that the evil stepmother is true to her evil name. And then when she grows up, she is kind of taken on as a maid for the evil stepmother and the evil stepsisters, and they all tell her to clean the floor and wash the dishes and make their food and stuff like that, and eventually one day, the king of this kingdom that she lives in, decides he's going to host a grand ball to find a wife or a partner for his son, the prince. The evil stepmother gets invited to the ball, and she decides that it would be a great idea to have her two actual daughters go, and she schemes to have Cinderella stay behind, and Cinderella doesn't know this, so she is mystified, and she makes a dress, and she gets prepared, and then when she shows up to go to the ball, the evil stepmother tears off her necklace and shreds up her clothing and says that she's not allowed to go because she's simple and she's not one of the family. And so the evil stepmother goes with the evil stepsisters to the ball, and then Cinderella cries, and that's when her fairy godmother shows up and transforms some of her friends, her animal friends, into humans, and transforms a pumpkin into a giant chariot, and gives her a magic dress and glass slippers, and provides her with everything she needs for this party. And she heads out to the party in her pumpkin mobile, pulls up, hops out, stuns everyone, walks inside, instantly the prince is like, this is the future wife, and then walks over, they dance together, and then the evil stepmother and stepsisters see that they're dancing and are shocked. I don't know if they recognize her, but they are shocked to see that they aren't the ones who are getting to dance with the prince, but Cinderella has to leave because her magic wears off at midnight, which is stupid, that doesn't make sense to me, if it's magic it should just work. But she leaves, probably for a good plot point, and returns back home as herself, not in her like gallant dress, but she left behind a glass slipper, which the prince finds, and the prince is mystified by her and decides that he has to go and find out who she is, so he roams the land fitting a shoe onto fair maidens, trying to figure out if they're the one who he danced with, because apparently he just can't remember her face, I guess he just can only remember her shoe size. But eventually he arrives at Cinderella's house, where the evil stepmother has locked her in a building, this part's from the movie though, I don't know if it was in the book, and then the animals help her get out of the room, and then she shows up downstairs when the prince is fitting the shoe onto the stepsister's feet, and their feet are way too big and are squishing in, so he's disgusted, and then he sees her, and kind of instantly knows it's her, but then has to put the shoe on, because once again I guess he can't just remember her face.

She had to clean the floors, had to clean the chimney, everything like that. So she was not happy, but she did her job. She wanted to keep her dad happy because he had already lost one wife. So one day in the castle, the king was talking to his right-hand man and told him that he wanted his son to get married so he would have an heir to the throne. So the right-hand man, which I can't remember the title for, I'm just calling the right-hand man, went to all the houses in the village and gave them an invitation to a grand ball for all the people, all the girls eligible bachelorettes to go to the ball, of course being escorted by their parents. Well, Cinderella read the letter over her stepmother's shoulder and got excited because she thought, wow, I can go and I can be part of this thing. Well, her stepsisters didn't exactly like that. So Cinderella went and got it, started to make a dress. She had the mice that were making dresses for her because hers wasn't very pretty and she wanted a pretty dress. So they made her a pretty dress and the night of the ball came and she put on her pretty dress and went to where her mother, her stepmother, and her stepsisters were waiting and they were not happy. The stepsisters were not happy that Cinderella was even thinking about going. So they ripped her dress and ripped her necklace, messed up her hair and said, you can't go. So after that, Cinderella went out into the garden and she was crying because she really wanted to go and she felt betrayed. So all of a sudden, up pops her fairy godmother and her fairy godmother says, well, I can solve your problem. We'll make a magic dress and she waves a magic wand. She has a beautiful dress. She waves a magic wand, turns a pumpkin and all the mice into a chariot and footmen and everything like this and they rode off in that carriage to the palace and at the palace, Cinderella danced with the prince, the king's son.

Cinderella had no life of her own, so spent a lot of time with all the farm animals, telling them stories of how she would like to meet Prince Charming. Then one day, it was announced that Prince Charming would be holding a ball to try to find a wife. So Cinderella got excited, saying she would go to the ball and make a beautiful dress and meet Prince Charming. At the same time, the stepsisters were getting ready for the ball also, talking of how they would marry Prince Charming and live a wonderful life with him too. So the night of the ball, Cinderella puts on the beautiful pink dress she had made, put on some jewelry and did her hair and was walking out when the stepsisters said, where do you think you're going? And Cinderella says, I'm going to the ball. And they ripped her dress to pieces and tore her jewelry off and messed up her hair so she couldn't go to the ball. As they left and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her. Cinderella was so upset that she couldn't go to the ball any longer and she sat outside and cried. All of a sudden, the fairy godmother came along and said, what are you crying for? And she said, I can no longer go to the ball. My dress is all torn and I have nothing else to wear. And the fairy godmother said, oh dear, let me take care of that for you. And with the wave of her wand, she gave Cinderella a beautiful dress and her hair was all in a beautiful hairdo. And she has some beautiful glass slippers. And Cinderella said, thank you, fairy godmother, but now how will I get there? And so the fairy godmother says, well, here's a coach for you to take you to the ball, but you have to leave at midnight or it'll turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella says, oh, no problem. I'll be home by midnight. Thank you so much. So off to the ball she goes in her carriage and her beautiful dress and her glass slippers. Cinderella gets to the ball and is in awe of how beautiful it is. And she sees Prince Charming and Prince Charming sees her immediately and comes over to her and asks her to dance. And so they dance for hours. And then Cinderella hears the clock strike midnight and she gets worried and says, oh no, I have to leave. And she immediately runs out the door. And as she's running to the carriage, she loses one of her slippers and doesn't have time to go grab it. So she jumps in the carriage and the carriage takes her off into the distance, leaving Prince Charming to wonder who the beautiful woman was. So when Cinderella's home, all she can dream about is her night at the ball and how wonderful it was. And in the meantime, Prince Charming is wondering who this beautiful woman was and how he's gonna find her. And realizes he can take the glass slipper and find out who it fits and that will be his girl. So he sends his assistant off to the village to try the shoes on all the women to see if he can find her for him. When he gets to Cinderella's house, the stepsisters had heard the story of them coming to try the slipper on all the women. So they're convinced that one of them will fit into the slipper. When the man comes into the house and the shoe doesn't fit the two stepsisters, he sees Cinderella and says, you haven't tried the shoe on yet.

Great pregnancy, got up, I went to work every day. Due date was January, January 18th, and first baby, the baby was not born. We did not find out the sex, and even back then, you could, I wanted to be totally surprised. I love surprises. So, on January 18th, I had still not had the baby and had a scheduled checkup with the OB doctor and assumed it would be my last visit. Anyway, went in after work. My husband met me because first child. He was at all the appointments, and I am like, well, before I moved to Florida, very fair and tall and fair, tall, and what was the other thing? Never like a muscular kind of person. Anyway, the whole time I'm carrying this baby, which, by the way, first baby, this baby barely moved, and I had, comparatively to the second, I had nothing, I thought it was fine because what did I know? Nothing, and every time I would push my stomach, I would say, oh, she, because my mother had three girls and my other sister had three girls and my other sister had a girl, so I would say, oh, she's gonna have a really firm butt. This is wonderful. So last visit, last checkup, he does an internal, and he's like, oh, why don't we go across the hall? I wanna do a scan or I don't know what they called it at the time, and he says, yep, he goes, just what I thought, and I was like, what? Because I'm cloud-like. It was just such an exciting time because the baby is not in position, so you're gonna have a C-section, and I was like, a C-section? That was one of my two secret, secret fears of having a baby. I was like, absolutely not. You can flip this baby, you can do this, you can do that. He's like, if it was pregnancy, we really don't know why the baby didn't drop. I can't see, I guess that was another thing on the image. He couldn't see the cord, or he said a little bit, we don't really know how long the cord is. He gave me every reason this baby was not gonna be flipped, so there's lots of things out there. Andrea, this was a Thursday, January 18th. I wish you look to see if I'm correcting my memory, and I went home that night. There was no internet, but folklore, like upside down, leaning on a ironing board, a flashlight between your legs, all this kooky, kooky stuff. But anyway, Monday, it was a Thursday. Monday, I was scheduled for my C-section, so on Friday, I went for all my blood work. That was the only day I missed at work. I worked a full day on Thursday, missed Friday, and the baby was scheduled to be born on Monday, and Sunday night, I went to bed, and my water broke, and I was so excited, because then I felt a little bit more like the baby's truly ready. It's not like C-section, like just ripping this baby out. So I was all excited, and we were in Michigan by ourselves, so I didn't wake up my husband. I decided to go get my bag, and I got everything ready by the door before I woke him up, and I showered, and I shaved my legs, and now the contractions are getting worse, and I could not find the list of people he had to call."}, {"filename": "wright22a_89210_328104.wav", "transcript": "Well, sometimes someone will ask you for directions and you'll try to say it the best you can but I don't know how to explain it.

Now we're going to middle school where I was in helmet class and it was time to learn to sew. So I was sewing on a jacket with a little tiny one eighth seam. And as I was moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the needle. And you know, it does that and I yanked it. So the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer. And he said he was going to pull it out and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital and they had to remove my fingernail and slice my finger open, take out the needle and then X-ray because they had little splinters of, um, metal in there, X-ray that, and then sew it back up and I had a huge band-aid. And unfortunately, like two days later, um, it was the little middle school dance and I was embarrassed because I had a new dress and I had this great big old bandage. Um, what helped me get over it? I think it was just time. Just time. I have more injuries. Thank you so much for the road. No, um, that was great. Thank you so much for sharing. And oh my goodness, I do not. So that was the end of my sewing days. And this helmet teacher hasn't been retired long and I was used. She said, here I am. Becca even had her when she was in middle school. She had to use me as an example through all of her years of teaching. So how's that? Um, but I am curious, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? Okay, great. Um, so in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did to what you did about it, if anything. I was special needs teacher for 10 years and still go. Um, so does Becca for that matter, still go to Eagle IRA once a year with them. And there are usually seven to eight that go and we chaperone and they have classes, but three of them are brothers of which only one can speak the others. You have to, um, follow their, uh, hand communication. It's not that they sign language, but they try to, cause it's more in the grunting, um, aspect of interesting enough, usually her, his mom knows what he's referring to. Um, so I would say it's more being patient and they eventually get their story out by pointing by, um, doing the same thing over, or they'll come and get you by the hand and take you to what they're trying to show you or tell you.

And she gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball. But the fairy godmother says, be sure you're home by midnight. The magic's only good for one day. At the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and it makes a heck of an impression on the prince, he just wants to dance with her all night. When she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight, oh goodness, so she turns and races out of the ball. And in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers, falls off of her foot, hops into her carriage and as they race away, but right at the stroke of midnight, the horses change back into mice, the carriage changes back into a pumpkin and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen. She sneaks into the house and all her stepsisters were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady."}, {"filename": "MSUC03b_502467_741303.wav", "transcript": "Hmm, something important. I guess a lot of important things sort of happened, you know? Be hard to, I think, I think, in a sense, I made my own important things. For instance, um, I grew up in a family. I was one of five children. And now I don't want this to sound, you know, politically incorrect. My father was Italian, of Italian descent. And he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college. And unfortunately, four of us were girls. That wasn't, he wasn't pleased with that either. And I was the third one, can you imagine? In a row, no boys yet. So anyhow, it was made very clear that college was not on the map. And his idea was that I've been supporting you all these years, and now you owe me. You know, you have to go to work and contribute to the household. So this was a built-in thing. At the time, I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it, that I'll be going to work soon. And the good news was that I was also an honor student, and I got to high school at 12. And the bad news was, at 16, my education was complete. And now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was, she was suicidal, I think, when she heard I wasn't going to college, because I was an honor student. She actually wanted to call him. And I was very calm about the whole thing. I said, there's really no point. You know, you're not gonna get anywhere. This is the state of things. It's the state of the art at the D'Amico household, and that's that. So anyway, she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on Wall Street, and who worked in a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust Company, which no longer exists. And they took great pride in that company, that they were at One Wall Street, and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street, and this was verbalized. So anyway, she called her friend, and I'll never forget her name was Mary Unruh, who I went to see. So I put a suit on, went shopping, and bought myself a very inexpensive type of thing, and went for the interview. And I think I was a shoo-in, because her friend, the guidance counselor, had called her. And so she hired me, and I ended up in a sub-basement, not just a basement. It was a sub-basement. I think I was lower than the vaults. In a secretarial pool, where else? I could be a genius, but I was going to a secretarial pool. And good on me. I did have the wherewithal, when I was still in school, even though I had an academic course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study, and I took typing and stenography. I thought this might help me. And maybe my job won't be so random. I have at least a specific skill, rather than just the resident genius, wherever I end up."}, {"filename": "NEURAL26-2_671886_910702.wav", "transcript": "Okay, the story of Cinderella begins with Cinderella herself and her dad.

So as they were blending these families together, Cinderella spent a lot of time with her stepmother, but her stepmother favored her children over Cinderella and had Cinderella do all the chores in their house. And the stepsisters didn't really have to do any chores. They were the favored ones. But Cinderella never complained. She made friends with all the animals around the house and was just a happy-go-lucky girl. And one day there was going to be a big ball at the castle and all the young maidens in the land were invited to attend the celebration. But Cinderella's stepmother said she couldn't go because she did not have a proper dress, but her stepsisters were going to go and they had the best dresses around. And Cinderella found her trunk with a dress, but her mother said it wasn't suitable to go. So Cinderella was crying with her animal friends and out of nowhere appeared her fairy godmother who turned her dress into a beautiful ball gown and turned her animal friends into the carriage and the horse and the driver. So she was able to attend the ball. So she attended the ball, but her fairy godmother had one wish for her or one statement for her that all the dress and the carriage would expire at midnight. So she had to leave the dance before midnight. So she went to the dance and she danced with the prince and they had a wonderful time. And she saw the clock was getting close to being midnight. So she left in a hurry because she didn't want her gown to change back to just a plain old dress. And at that time she accidentally lost her glass slipper, but she returned to her house and told her animal friends all about the dance and meeting the prince. Well, and unbeknownst to her, the prince had kept the glass slipper and he wanted to find out who the maiden was that wore that glass slipper. And so they took the glass slipper all through town to see whose foot would fit in the glass slippers. And when they came to her house, both her stepsisters tried on the slipper and it would not fit. So Cinderella came and said, may I try it on? And she did and it fit and her and her prince lived happily ever after. The end. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. First you go to your cabinet and you take out the bread and the peanut butter and you need two slices of bread for the sandwich and you need a knife and you spread the peanut butter over one slice of the bread and then you go in the refrigerator and get out your grape jelly and you put it on the other side of the bread and you close the two halves together and cut it diagonal."}, {"filename": "wright35a_541918_780708.wav", "transcript": "washes away.

And the birds help and the mice help and they get the dress made up real pretty. They sing, we can do it, we can do it. They get this song going and they get the dress made and Cinderella comes in the attic and they surprise her with this beautiful dress and she's so happy she can go to the ball. So she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and her stepsisters to wait because she could go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished all her chores. And the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks in her beautiful dress and they see that the decorations are stuff that she quote-unquote stole from their garbage so they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back and they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball. Cinderella goes running to the garden and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball and this fairy godmother appears and does this bibbidi-bobbidi-boo thing, whips her up a real pretty white dress and then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses and she tells Cinderella to go dance with the prince but she has to be back by midnight or the spell will wear off. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she meets the prince and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with and she hears the clock strike midnight and she has to go and the prince is like but wait but wait I don't even know your name and she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach which will soon be a pumpkin and as she's running down the stairs one of her shoes falls off and she gets in the coach and the coach takes her home and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin and the horses turn back into the mice and the footman turns back into a dog and the next day she's walking around the house and she hears the Duke come to the door and says the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride but he doesn't know who she is so he's going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that the Cinderella's left this maidens left behind. So he ends up going to Cinderella's house and she hears Duke coming to the door and she goes to her room and the stepmother locks her in her room puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the Duke into the house. The Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small and as the mother's sitting there the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rescue Cinderella and again they run into the cat but they escape the cat again go underneath the door and they hand the key to Cinderella and she unlocks the door and as she's leaving the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister and one stepsister is too small and one's foot was too big and as he's leaving Cinderella runs down the stairs and says but wait I want to try the shoe on and the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderella is the one the prince was dancing with."}, {"filename": "richardson191_47701_286491.wav", "transcript": "So Billy was at a soccer game and when he got home he was so excited because he scored a few goals and he decided to keep practicing and he kicked a soccer ball and it went through the window and hit his dad on the knee and his dad realized it was him and grounded him.

So take a look at the pictures and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay. Um, well, um, it looks like John wanted to borrow his mom's umbrella, but his mom wouldn't let him or his mom tried to give him an umbrella, but he didn't accept the umbrella. And then he walked to school and it was raining and he got really wet and he was upset and realized he should have listened to his mom. So the next day he brought an umbrella to school. Okay, great.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to get you to take a look at this book. This will just kind of help refresh your memory. So take a look at the pictures in this book and when you're finished, I'm going to take the book back and then I'm going to have you tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay, I think I got it. Alright. So, Cinderella was, I think, adopted and brought into a family. She had two stepsisters and a mom. She was really mistreated. She was basically treated like the house slave or whatever. She'd do everything for them. And then, so she developed relationships with the animals and stuff around their property or whatever. And then, eventually, she meets this fairy godmother that grants her wish to go to this ball or something of that sort. And she meets a prince who has a great night with him and everything and loses one of her slippers. And then, at the end of the story, the prince comes back with the slippers. And the two evil stepsisters are trying to pretend, like, think, Oh, my slipper might fit me. But then it ends up fitting Cinderella. And, basically, your dreams come true. Okay, great. Alright, so we have one more thing. It's going to be a little bit different. So, I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

And so the doctor came in at that time and I said, he's afraid that we put something contaminated into his lung cavity. So he goes out and gets the head nurse and she comes up, does another, she goes and cleans it out again, which she said, I don't like doing this twice so soon, but I feel like I should. Well, the eleventh day, I was at work and they called me and they told me that, he told me that he was shaking the bed, he was jerking so, well he said, get him to the hospital. I called the doctor and he said, get him to the hospital. And the bacteria, we ran into that nurse in the hospital before we got into the doctor's office and she smelled it, the area, she said, it's back. So there he had, they had killed all of those blood cells in there, no hope. So he had to wear a tube and they said he'd be in there for years and it'd be there the rest of his life. And so this goes on for eight years that I had to change the bandage and clean out that area every day to give him peace and quiet. And it was very painful. At first, I was supposed to go to the hospital every day, every time to get the catheter and it all changed because it was a procedure that had to be done in the hospital. Well, my daughter was a nurse and she kept wanting me to go to the VA because he was a veteran and get the things over there and they had a bacteria committee over there that might be able to help him. So we'd go over there and while we were in this office, there was this cabinet there that had tape, silk tape in it, and it was wide. And so I asked the nurse, I said, where do you get that wide tape? I said, I can only find the narrow and it takes so much of it to get it bandaged up. We were paying over $200, close to $300 at that time, a month for his supplies. And she said, you can have anything you want. Well, the doctor had told me before we went over there that it was a procedure that he knew I could do it, but he wouldn't give it to me because it was a procedure done in the hospital. So when she told me I could have anything I wanted, I told her what size catheter I wanted, sterilized pins, and the solution to irrigate with, and everything that he needed and the sterilized gloves and all. So I go home and the first time it needed to be irrigated, I do it myself. Well, after I got through, I sat there, couldn't get up because I thought if that pin that went down into his cavity, they'd have to do surgery to get it, to get that tube out. And so I was scared to death, but he said, I did a much better job than they did at the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through them to keep it from falling down into his lung cavity. And that way, I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He weighed 200 and some pounds, and then he went down to 126 when he left the hospital. And he came back up. Nobody knew that he was sick, and the doctor said that he couldn't have lived if it hadn't been for me. So he wanted to have the, the doctor said the only thing that they could do is go in there, clean that cavity out, and put in marbles in there to make that, to build it up to where it would, he'd have more stability.

So at least a week, but it may have been more, but at least, you know, I did it until they, saw this guy coming every day, you know, what's he doing? Oh, he's selling the ticket. No wonder we don't get such a long line, you know, he's taking the business. Okay. I have one more that's very similar. Again, if you'll look through these pictures and then tell me a story with the beginning, the middle, and the end. So this goes back to the time when my brother, Sam, kicked the ball into our neighbor's house. Now, a little bit about our neighbor. He was a very, he was a bachelor, a gentleman. He was very nice, but he did not want us playing ball in our backyard, which was very, very close to his house. So what was supposed to happen, and I told Sam, you know, one day, one of us is going to kick the ball into, into our neighbor's window. His name was Mortimer. So we're going to kick the ball into Mortimer's window. We're going to be in trouble. He said, no, we shouldn't worry about that. Okay. It went with it until the day came when Sam kicked the ball into our neighbor's Mortimer's window. So it went on into, into the house. Not only did it break the window, it also knocked over a lamp that Mr. Mortimer had told us was a very, very dear object in his house. It had a history of family inheritance and heirloom that I can't quite remember, but I do remember how much he appreciated the lamp. So we were both frozen when we saw Mortimer look through the hole that Sam had just put in the window. And I can't tell you what the consequences were, but I do remember that we had a very, very hard time after that incident. Thank you very much. Excellent. I could have gone on for another 15 minutes on the consequences, and then the suit with a higher court, and then we hired a different lawyer. Good restraint because I have so many other tasks for you. Okay. Here's a similar task. Please look through these pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay. I remember my Aunt Charlotte. My Aunt Charlotte was a very, very wicked person. I did not like her at all. And I remember staying in her house one day. For some reason, we weren't allowed to stay at home because the painters had just finished painting and they didn't want us to sleep where there was paint, fresh paint smell around. So I stayed at Aunt Charlotte's. Well, lo and behold, the next day, it turned out that it was a rainy day. So I'm going to go to school, which was a much longer walk from Aunt Charlotte's house than it was from my house. And it was raining. So I said, hey, Aunt Charlotte, can I please borrow your umbrella? And guess what? She said no, which I knew she was going to say no because that's how wicked she was.

Okay, so 10 years ago in July, I had a right rotator cuff repair surgery and it was going to be a little bit more involved, that there was a growth somewhere up there, so he couldn't do it endoscopically, so I knew it was going to be open shoulder surgery. Went in and the slight tear in the rotator cuff at that point, from the time of the MRI to the surgery, went from a slight tear to a full tear. He also saw for the first time that my bicep was fully torn and that the nickel size growth apparently now is the size of a golf ball, so he graphed bone from, I don't know, collarbone area and the bottom line is he was from this area, he was all the way down bicep area and that was that. It was supposed to be a day surgery. Later that evening, the nurse came in, monitored me, monitored me, and I had horrible pain all night and then eventually around, I don't know, three or four in the morning, I really don't know what time, she came in and she jabbed my thigh with a thing of morphine and knocked me out. Finally, she had done that at midnight and I forgot a really important point. Earlier in the evening, the evening nurse came in and rubbed my arm here. Can you feel this? Can you feel this? Yes, yes, yes. Then when she got to mid-forearm, can you feel this all the way down to my hand? I said no. She said, oh, no worries. It's just a block. It takes up to 24 hours to wear off, but I was kind of freaked out about it, but anyway, but I didn't know any better. Into the bad night, morphine around three, four in the morning, and then the surgeon came in for his rounds early in the morning, around six-ish, heard you had a horrible night. I said yes, and I was supposed to be day surgery, so you're going to have to go home soon. It's only going to get worse, he said, so I'd be happy to give you another block, but I have to tell you, there's a 50-50 chance I may give you another block. You could lose feeling in your fingers forever, and I remember just being like, where is ... I've never heard this before, anyway, so I didn't want it, but I was already starting to be in a lot of pain, and I only had had the morphine, which had only been, I don't know, no more than four hours old, so I was panicked. I said, let me think about it. He said, you think about it, but I'm going to go around, do the rest of the floor, come back to you. You have to have your answer by the time I come back, so I said, all right. As soon as he left, I was like, I can't chance it, and I was afraid to fall asleep. Bruce was coming. He was dropping kids off from preschool at that point, one of them was, so he was there by 7.45 in the morning, told him the same story I just told you, and I said, I don't want to risk having a second block, so he didn't, and there was a wonderful male nurse on that day for the morning shift, and he medicated me as much as he could with the standing orders to make it a day surgery and get me through. Ended up being released around 4 that afternoon, and anyway, there was a lot, an EEG and all sorts of tests, and second and third opinions, Boston and New York, they all said surgeon error.

So they were very mean to Cinderella and she became like a housekeeper for them. She did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked and they mistreated her. So one day there was a ball given by the king and queen to find a suitable wife for their son, the prince. So the invitation came and the stepsisters were all excited but poor Cinderella, she couldn't go. She didn't have the clothes. Her stepmother and stepsister said she wasn't invited to the king's ball. So she wished she could go to the ball but she had no way to do that and she was very sad. And so the night of the ball, the stepsisters get to go to the ball. They're all dressed up. They're very fancy and ready to go to the ball and out the door they go. Cinderella is down in the basement and she's crying and all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and asks why she's crying. And she says she wished she could go to the ball. And so the fairy godmother said that she could and fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into carriage drivers and she had horses for the carriage and she casts a spell and Cinderella has a beautiful dress and her hair is beautiful. She has a beautiful dress and she says, you will go to the ball, go to the ball. But one rule is that at 12 o'clock midnight, you must be home by 12 o'clock because all of this magic is going to go away. Cinderella goes off to the ball. She gets there. The prince becomes smitten with her. When he sees her, he's dancing with her. Her stepsisters are just seething because who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with? They wanted to be chosen by the prince and the night is going wonderfully and then she hears the clock strike 12 and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken and she runs out and down the stairs, leaving the prince behind. And as she's running down the stairs, one of her glass slippers comes off because when the fairy godmother casts the spell, she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing. One of them gets left behind on the steps and she runs home and she gets home before, you know, as the spell is being broken. Well, the prince is very smitten with her and he wonders who this beautiful woman was and he wants to find throughout the kingdom who this woman is.

And then she's forced to do all the chores and while the other two sisters live in luxury. And Cinderella is really nice and makes the most of it and befriends all of the animals. And then one day a letter, or in the same city, there's a prince or there's like a royal family. So the prince is of age where he needs to get married.

The woman had two daughters, and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created. Eventually the father died, leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and her two half-sisters, or two sisters. The stepmother was not happy about this, and she did not see Cinderella as her own, so she made her more of a house servant than a daughter, and she made her wait on her two daughters and clean house and take care of them. Cinderella was not happy about this, but she felt like that was her destiny, so she cleaned and cooked and did everything that she was told to do. Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart. She made friends with the animals. They were her only friends. She was so busy, she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends. Cinderella's gentle heart would carry her a long way. On the other side of the town was a castle, and the town was ruled by a king. This king had a son, and the son was of age to be married. They needed a new heir to the throne, and if he wasn't married, he could not become king, so the king decided to throw a ball, inviting all eligible young women, so he would have a large number to pick from for his future bride. The invitations were delivered, and certainly the stepsisters were invited. In fact, every young eligible woman was invited. Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation, but the stepmother was not about to let her go, so she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but she was unable to go. So off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball, and Cinderella stayed at home, very sad, very lonely, when suddenly some magical event occurred, and her fairy godmother appeared and said, Do not cry. You can go to the ball, and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress, and the stepmother instantly created a dress for her, and turned a pumpkin into a carriage, and the mice into horses, and Cinderella was ready to go to the ball. But one warning she was giving was, If you don't return before midnight, all the magic wears off, your dress will become rags again, and your carriage will become a pumpkin again. She said, Don't worry, stepmother, or fairy godmother, I will. So she goes to the ball, has a wonderful time dancing with the prince, and he is entirely taken with her.

She becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and has to attend to their needs and the needs of the household and evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this so the girl ends up being in the household but being rather a member of the household being a servant as I said. One day a ball is announced, she lives in a I guess a principality headed by royalty and one day a ball is announced, if I recall correctly it's because the prince is in need of finding a wife. His father tells him that it's time for him to marry so a ball is organized and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend and the three stepsisters and their mother plan to go and they get their gowns ready and Cinderella has to help them with that too but it turns out that she's not going to be allowed to go.

So a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper and the stepsisters of course try and they don't fit and they try to push their feet into that slipper and it doesn't work and they're very upset and lo and behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly with her slipper and they're very very surprised, shocked and upset."}, {"filename": "richardson179_263928_502604.wav", "transcript": "So Cinderella was the name of the daughter of a gentleman, and he, Cinderella's mother passed away, and he got remarried to a woman that had two daughters. They were very horrible people, just in general. But they got married, and so they blended the families, but meanwhile, Cinderella's father passed away, and the minute that he passed away, the evil stepmother started treating Cinderella very poorly. She would basically give her daughters anything and everything that they wanted, so she spoiled them rotten, but made Cinderella basically be the servant for everyone. She would have to scrub the floors, do the cooking, take care of the sisters. But one of the dreams that Cinderella had was to meet, or to go and see the castle. Well, at the same time, in the castle, the king is really sort of frustrated because his son, the prince, Prince Charming, has not selected a bride, so he's trying to think of a way to get his son to sort of urge him along to get married. So he decides to throw a huge ball and invite all of the maidens from the entire kingdom. So of course, the invitations go out to everyone. Cinderella's stepmother receives one, and it's asking for all of the young women to come to the ball. Of course, the evil stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited, and so they want to start getting prepared. But the stepmother does not want Cinderella to go, so she says she can go, but only after she finishes all her chores. But she overloads her with all of her chores, but she also has to help her stepsisters get ready. So basically, she has no time. However, Cinderella is friendly with all of the animals, the rats, the horses, and just everything. She can actually sort of talk to the animals. And while she is doing all of her chores, they're actually helping create her a dress. It was one that she had, I guess, that was her mother's. So they fix it up and make it look, you know, obviously modern for the time and fix it up. And as she finishes all of her chores, she gets in and it's very sad because she thinks that she's not going to have time to get ready. But alas, she is able to try to get ready to go, and she puts on the dress and steps out to catch the carriage to go with her stepsisters. But the rats and the animals had actually used bits and pieces of her stepsisters' castoffs to make the dress. And when they saw that, they, of course, became jealous because they were spoiled rotten. Not very nice. And so they started tearing her dress, the various pieces off, and so they left her dress in tatters and left her in emotional tatters. And so she runs back to her room and is crying, but at that moment in time, she meets her fairy godmother who is, well, a fairy. And so she is able to bippity boppity boo and make, cast spells to make a dress, to make a carriage, to have, you know, just sort of a very royal-type entrance. So she goes to the ball, meets Prince Charming, they have a wonderful time, but the spell would only last until midnight. So as they're dancing the night away, she loses track of time, and it's about 11.58, so she starts to flee the ball, and she has to get away before midnight or everything goes back to the way that it was. As she's running away, she loses one of her glass slippers, which is one of the, actually, the glass slippers, in mistranslation, it was actually supposed to be a fine leather sandal, but that's something totally separate, loses one of her glass slippers, runs away.

She was going to put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said, oh no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get the cat out of the tree.

I will tell you about having my tonsils out at Christmas. I had had strep throat five times in one year and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to have to come out, which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult and I still had them at all. So my sister came into town to stay with me during that week while I was going to be getting them out. I had to go to Scottsdale. I think I went to Scottsdale Samaritan to have it done but they did it like on a day surgery. But what I remember about it most is it hurt but my surgery was scheduled at like 11 30 in the morning but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there I was like a little bit dehydrated so they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me like six times in order to get the IV in and that was very very unpleasant. They finally got it in, took me into the little hospital room and I remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like oh that's gonna be great you're gonna give me drugs and I'm listening to Pink Floyd so this is gonna be a good day. So did that, laid down on the gurney, they gave me the IV and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery and my throat hurt. It was painful. I felt I wanted to cry. In fact I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurt so bad. They were trying to give me like some water to help kind of soothe out my throat and I couldn't swallow it so it was coming back out of my nose. It was just, it was a mess. It was horrible. But the whole thing probably took like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out but it was like 12 hours of torture for that and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. You know people are like oh you always get ice cream, you get ice cream but I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream so that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt and it was burning my throat and it was probably it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that. I've had people ask me you know if you had to do it all over again I was like I'd have just I'd just continue to have strep throat.

She always dreamed about looking out the castle window and dreamed about life elsewhere, and there was an announcement of a ball for the prince to be married, so she wanted to go to that. However, she had no way of getting there really because her stepsisters didn't want her to go. She ended up recruiting some friends, like her mice and dog friends, to make the dress for her, and so she ended up getting the dress ready and everything to go to the ball. It ends up that the stepsisters found out, they got mad, tore her dress apart, and she ended up crying and making her lips set, so her fairy godmother came along, provided her with a dress and flippers and a carriage, and told her she had to be back by midnight or else she would lose all of her dress and all of that. So she went to the ball, she met the prince, had a really great time, was sprinting out the door, leave by midnight, lost her slipper, and in the weeks preceding that, the prince had to go around and figure out who was this girl who missed her slipper because he was in love with her. The stepsisters and stepmom tried to prevent that, but it didn't end up working, and she ended up marrying the prince only halfway thereafter."}, {"filename": "wright02a_2777239_3015877.wav", "transcript": "Okay, young man, time to get going to school.

Once upon a time, a long, long ago, in the land of Make-Believe, there was a man who had lost his wife but had a young daughter, a sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella. He decided it was time that he took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman as she was growing up. She needed a mother. And so he married a widow, a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters. The woman, who was Cinderella's stepmother, came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her, cut the ice with her, and she banished her to the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs. And her own two little girls, who were really nasty little brats, got to sit around, get lots of new clothes, and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked. But she had her little cat, who she loved, and the cat kept her company and helped as much as she could. And this went on. Daddy was completely unaware."}, {"filename": "MSUC03a_674709_913342.wav", "transcript": "Life is learning from one's mistakes. Listen to your mother. Okay, here's another picture.

Okay, so Cinderella is sent to live with a family, and she is basically a maid, and they're the two stepsisters. I think it's the Wicked Stepsisters, if I recall. They were rather homely. Cinderella, of course, is very pretty, and she's very sweet and helpful, and these two are kind of spoiled and not very pleasant. And there's going to be a ball, and I believe invitations go out, and the two sisters are going to go to the ball, and Cinderella is not invited, and somehow the fairy godmother steps in, and Cinderella ends up with, well, it's all magical, you know, right? The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach, and by dint of, you know, luck and good favor from the fairy godmother, Cinderella does go to the ball. I believe the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight.

Okay. Now, I'm going to show you another set of pictures to tell a story, and take your time looking at them and give me a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Start when you're ready. Okay. There's a young boy and his mom, and his mom's trying to give him an umbrella, and he refuses it. He doesn't want to take it, and the mom's not happy when he refuses the umbrella, and he goes outside, and it starts to rain, and then it starts to pour down rain, and he comes home, and he's soaking wet, and his mom is mad that he's wet because he refused the umbrella and sends him back out with the umbrella. Okay. Oh, one more. Oh. I'm going to show you this picture that has a couple things going on in it. Take your time looking at it, and give me a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. There was a little girl riding her tricycle, and her cat somehow got up in the tree, and the dog is barking because he wants the cat, and that's probably why the cat ran up the tree, and then a man climbed up in the tree to try to get the cat, and he can't get down, and the firefighters are coming to come rescue the man because his ladder fell down and to rescue the cat. Okay. Perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you to tell me a story, and you've heard of Cinderella before, right? All right. You can look at the pictures in the book, and now they don't have words in it, and take as much time as you want, but when you're done, I'm going to take the book back and ask you to tell me the story. All right. All right. Now, tell me as much of the story as you can, and you can use any details that you know previously, as well as the pictures you just looked at. Okay. All right.

So he went for the ENT, sent him to the audiologist, and the audiologist was in this little glass room with stuffed animals that moved and cymbals and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this, and she proceeded to give him the test, which he proceeded to pass because before she moved the drums, he was so smart. She looked at the drums and then she looked at him and then she moved the drums. And then before she moved the monkey with the cymbal, she looked at the monkey with the cymbal and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway, the ENT and I get into it. In a big, loud way, because he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests. Anyway, we go through, so finally, finally, he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes, he starts with a speech language pathologist. He was 2.8, I think, at that time, that fall. I'll never forget the first session, Madison. I was like, this is never gonna work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early 30s. She looked like Cinderella, blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him to the verge of tears every sessions. We were private pay. She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate the session and she worked wonders. And we ate, drank, and slept letters and sounds. That sheep in the jeep book, alphabet cereal, alphabet pasta, it was like crazy town. So we did that with private pay with her. And then at three years old, the town would pick him up. So I thought, it's a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that SLP just in case with funding. And Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use, I can't, would be not ready for me to take your money anymore. He was initially, when she met him, consultation, he was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder, which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she dismissed him, you're good, he's all good to go, I was real paranoid. She's the only thing is 50% of the children with this diagnosis, the way they're taught, traditionally taught how to read in public schools, they're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that point have to, I don't know what, go to private school, get another read. I didn't know what we were gonna do, Madison, but I was like, ah. So anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP who had just graduated, Madison. She was lovely, so sweet. He manipulated her, he ruled the sessions. It was game on every time we went in there. She was so sweet, she had no idea what he was doing. We would leave, he would look at me and smile. Oh my gosh, it was terrible. And then she went off to I don't know where, and then he got an experienced older woman who again cracked the whip with him, Tracy O'Gara."}, {"filename": "wright03a_3212463_3451049.wav", "transcript": "Okay, the name of the book is Good Dog Carl.

Carl puts his hands up on the windowsill, looks out, watches to make sure the mother is gone. The baby is now standing up in the bed, looking very expectantly at the dog. The dog walks over to the crib, the baby steps out onto the dog's back, and they're off across the hallway to mother's bed, where they have a wonderful time playing on the big bed, in mother's bedroom. Then they move to the dresser, where the baby puts powder on the dog's nose, has the jewelry out, the next picture has the jewelry and the top of the powder box draped on the dog's head, and the baby has a handkerchief and a pin cushion on his head. There's breezes are blowing gently on the window curtains, and the furniture in the room, the size of the furniture has changed. The jewelry box is suddenly a whole lot larger. Hmm. Then, the next scene, the baby is obviously in the hallway or in the bathroom, is sitting on the edge of the laundry chute. The basket of clothes is beside the laundry chute. The dog, after seeing the baby sitting on the edge of the laundry chute, runs way down the stairs, down into the top of the basement stairs, look at the baby who's sitting happily on top of the dirty laundry. After having fallen all the way down the laundry chute, goes down into the basement. The baby gets back on his back, and they go back upstairs, and he starts across the floor running, pell-mell, sliding on a rug, which then upsets a table in the living room, scatters papers all over the floor, and then goes up to the large aquarium that in one picture is sitting beside a window, and in the next picture, the window is not there anymore. Anyway, the baby and the dog look at the aquarium. The next thing you see, he has the baby by the shirt, and he's dunking the baby in the aquarium, and that baby is paddling along with his nose, barely out of the water, through all the fishies in the aquarium. The next thing, the dog has the baby out of the aquarium, sitting on the rug, and has turned on the music, and the dog is dancing to the radio, and the baby is waving his hands in time to the music.

Something important. Well, let's see, when I was pregnant with my first child, and I read this book by Jenny McCarthy about when she was pregnant with her child and she ate all these brownies. And I thought, wow, look at her, she looks great. I'm gonna eat lots of brownies too. That was a big mistake because I ate, I gained like a ton of weight and ate brownies all the time. And then my blood pressure went really high. And like towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up with toxemia. And so I, they realized it when I had woken up one morning with like a, it was probably beyond a migraine because I was very sensitive to everything. My husband was blowing his nose in the other room and I wanted to kill him. And I just, it was like a pulsating thing in my head. And I went in and I had to the clinic, which was close to my house. And I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like, by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often. And it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken. Then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and talk really fast and write everything down that he says. And then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there. Well, that day I came in, went to pee in the cup and then went to go to take my blood pressure. And I'd have to sit at this machine and it takes your blood pressure and prints it out. And then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did, I went, put it in there, print it out. I handed it to the nurse and she was just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to go back and do it again. So I'm like, okay. So I do it again and it prints it out and it's just as high. So they're like so irritated with me by this point. Like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in and then the nurse who's the professional, right? Does it and realizes, holy crap, this woman's got like really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away. And they said, we're checking you in right now. And so, because this is very serious and they checked and they had like, I don't know, what is it? Like sugar or something in my urine and my, yeah. So there's all kinds of problems happening with me unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet. And after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down. But then they said, well, it's your, we could send you home, but we're not 100% sure that you could control this. So we think we should induce you because it was, I was far enough along. And so it was a Tuesday morning and they said at 5.30 in the morning, we're gonna bring you down to induce you. And they, oh, this is kind of gross, but they made me take a suppository, which just really, woo, everything's clean.

Ball goes crashing through a living room window, knocks over a lamp in the house, and the gentleman in there jumps, stands up, picks up the ball, looks out the window, and sees it's his favorite little neighbor kid. So he's not going to be too hard on him. Goes out, gives him the ball, and has him mow the grass to work off the price of the window. Looks like mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella. And mom keeps it. Little boy's smiling, though, says goodbye. He's walking to school, and it starts to sprinkle. And then it starts raining harder, so he turns around and goes back home. Oh, can I back up? OK. Little boy says, no, mom, I don't want to take the umbrella. I'm not a sissy. And mom's angry because she really wants him to, because she can see that it is going to rain no matter what. So he runs back home, shows mom he's all wet, and says, OK, I guess I'll take that umbrella after all. And then he heads back to school in the rain, happy that he's got the umbrella. OK. Cinderella, Walt Disney's Cinderella. There once was a little girl, a beautiful little girl, whose mother had died. Her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her. Unfortunately, he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom, and she had two spoiled, rotten little girls. And then, unfortunately, he also passed away. So the mom and the stepsisters and the little Cinderella do all the work, all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the sewing. And she didn't have anyone to talk to. So she made friends with the animals. She'd go out and feed them, and they'd talk together. They were her companions. One day, the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife. So he sent out an invitation to all the eligible young women in the land. And the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it, and her daughters were so happy. And they said, OK, sure, Cinderella, you can go, but you don't have anything to wear. So the little animals made her a dress. They made it look beautiful. They sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball. So when it was time to leave, she came down, and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be. And they said, oh, Cinderella, that's my scarf and my necklace. And they ripped the things off because they said she stole it from them, even though they'd thrown the stuff away earlier. So now she really does have nothing to wear.

And after which point, I think I've forgotten the actual order, but it seems like the something happens with the father and it's just the four of them. And the Cinderella doesn't really have anyone anymore. She just has the animals who are her friends, because otherwise she's cleaning the house and taking care of the wicked stepmother and the wicked stepsisters. And they take care, they kind of are quite selfish and do whatever they want. And then from there, oh, there's the castle far, far away. And one day they hear, the stepmother hears of this announcement she reads in the book about how, oh, yes, it looks like the prince is looking for someone to marry. And they're going to have all of these young women come to the castle for a ball. So Cinderella gets her lovely outfit made by herself and the animals. No, no, that one was made by herself. And then she goes and gets ready to go. And then the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are ready to go. But then they say, oh, no, you're not going to go. And they rip all of her clothes off. And then she's crying and very upset and goes upstairs and is in her room. And then the, I think this part is a little bit hazy. Maybe she goes out to a garden, actually, and that's when she meets her fairy godmother. And it seems like she sings a song with bippity boppity boo. Is that it? Or maybe another fairy tale. Anyway, so she waves her wand and then her dog becomes a, does her dog become a horse or one of the carriagemen? And then the mice, the mice turn into something and then the pumpkin becomes her carriage. And then the rule was that at midnight you must be out of there because the magic will wear off. And she also gives her this beautiful white dress and a crown and glass slippers. And then she goes off to the castle or the palace. And of course, the prince immediately falls in love with her and wants to dance with her all night long. And the stepsisters and the stepmother do not even recognize her or everyone is watching and saying, who is that beautiful young woman? We don't know who she is.

If you jump into the whirlpool, even with the life jacket on, it'll suck you to the bottom of the river. Normally, it spits you up 5 to 10 feet after it sucks you down. If you hit it just perfectly, you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro, and it takes you up about 50 feet. I was about the fifth person to do it. The first four people jumped in and popped up 10 feet later. I jumped in, hit it perfect, and it carried me down to the bottom, dragged me along, started to pop me up about 10 feet, sucked me back down, and I sucked in a big gulp of water as I came to the surface. I thought I was coming back down. I was about a foot from the surface. I could see the light, and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another 40 feet. I thought I was going to drown. I had a life jacket on. It sucked me to the bottom. So there was a girl who got caught in a river. It doesn't look like a flood.

And fortunately it didn't hit anything hard on the ground or it would have just been a pile of glass shards. But he has a slipper and he makes the rounds of every household in the country, of course, not including the lower class ones or the households that were owned by immigrants or foreigners who had been living there but couldn't become citizens or any of the other riffraff, but just the households with eligible women who could, by means of class, be his princess.

I was tired. I had one glass of wine, I can remember, I had one glass of wine, I had some tamales, I had beans and rice and a salad. And after that I just started really getting sleepy and tired. So I said I had to get going home. So I went home, I rolled the window down, I started dozing off a little bit. And then I continued going home. At that time I lived in Upland.

Then I woke up again and I was in the hospital. And I woke up and there was patches all over my face. I could barely see, I had only one eye because my other face was covered. What happened is I ran into a telephone post. And I had cuts, I still have a scar here. I pushed, I had my fingers, my thumbs, I was holding the steering wheel like this.

But what I did do with a force, and I was wearing a seatbelt, but I ended up twisting my upper torso. So I was so much in pain. And they fixed my, oh by the way, I cut my face somehow. I tore my face right in here, I had to have plastic surgery. But I had to go to a chiropractor because I couldn't even pick up my shoe. So I went to a chiropractor and he took an x-ray and my spine was like an S with the force of hitting that telephone post. So it took me about six months.

And so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checked weather.com this morning and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain. So he's probably okay. And so the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds onto the umbrella. And lo and behold, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain. And he's dismayed because not only was he right, he also now doesn't have an umbrella. And so he runs back home and he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he's not allowed to say, I told you so. And his mother relents and gives him an umbrella with which to walk to school.

It's just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again with a beginning, a middle, and an end. All right. It was a nice morning and this bird was in the tree, singing, at which point the cat thought to itself, I'm a cat. I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential. And so the cat climbs the tree only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow and the cat is not really about that. And so it just kind of gives up on the bird and goes to the end of a different branch because he can't get down, so he may as well look like he did it on purpose. At which point, the little girl riding by on her tricycle sees the cat and thinks to herself, that cat needs rescuing because I'm nosy. And so she goes and she reaches for the cat, but the cat is too scared to come down and is certainly not going to jump into a strange girl's arms because it's a cat and they're ornery. And so the girl goes and gets her dad and the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up with the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there and he's not really about that. So he goes to climb back down the ladder when the dog notices the cat. It's just a stray dog. It lives by the school that, you know, goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet it. It's a nice dog, but it sees the cat and it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident. And so the man is stuck in the tree even though he could jump. That's not that tall. The man is a big old baby and he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking, barking up the right tree. And so he pulls his cell phone out of his pocket it's probably a flip phone, maybe a Nokia, like something really sturdy. He looks like an old fashioned kind of guy."}, {"filename": "richardson175_17933_256420.wav", "transcript": "Okay, the boy is outside, he's playing soccer, and he's kicking the ball, and unfortunately he kicks it through his neighbor's window, which seems to shock his neighbor, who knocks over the vase and it wakes him up from sleeping, or he's watching TV or something, and it shocks him and he's not expecting it, and then he's looking out the window at the ball to see who the perpetrator is, I assume.

Okay, Cinderella seems to be brought to, perhaps she has no parents, or something that she's brought to her aunt's house, or something like that, to live, and she's made to be used as a maid. What she waits on her two cousins and her aunt, and takes care of the animals and all that, and it appears that her two cousins are invited to a party, a ball of some sort, I guess, and they're excited about going to the ball, and she has no clothes, but little mice and stuff, and birds make a dress for her, and so she goes to the ball, and the chariot, which, I guess that was her fairy godmother, or something, gave her the chariot."}, {"filename": "wright61a_419000_657486.wav", "transcript": "Little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died. After which her father married a second time to a middle-aged woman who he fell in love with who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters. Poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother, her stepmother, and the daughters. She did all the ironing, the cleaning, and everything else. And because she was such a nice person, she did it willingly because she had a good heart. One day the old king approached his son and said, It's about time you got married. I'm going to throw a ball and you, I hope, will find your future wife at the ball. The prince wasn't too keen on the idea, but finally he agreed. When the stepmother and the ugly sisters found out about this ball, they tried their level best to make themselves look as well as they could. They bought new clothes, they did their hair, they made themselves as presentable as they could. Cinderella, in the meantime, looked out of her window and saw the castle where the big ball was taking place and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball. She was helped by her little friends, the mice and the owl, and they all said, Oh, Cinderella, why don't you try and contact your fairy godmother? She might be able to help you. Cinderella said, I don't know how to do that. They said, well, look in the trunk. There's a book in the trunk. If you read how to find your fairy godmother, she might turn up and be able to help you. She did that and when the fairy godmother approached and said, Cinderella, you shall go to the ball. She suddenly, with her magic, was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made out of a pumpkin. She changed the mice into coachmen and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress. She said, you go and you have a good time, my child, but remember one thing, when the clock strikes midnight, you must already have returned from the ball. So Cinderella promised to do that. She went to the ball. The prince fell madly in love with her and she with him and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock struck twelve. So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could and in doing that, left a little glass slipper on the step. That was the only thing that the prince had to identify her with. Shortly after that, the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman, he had no idea who she was. The only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper. So he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper and said, anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her. And of course the courtier arrived at Cinderella's house and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and of course couldn't do that until Cinderella said, I would like to try. And she did and of course the slipper fit and the prince was delighted to have found her again."}, {"filename": "NEURAL6-2_713901_952381.wav", "transcript": "Okay. In, let's see, in the late 90s, my husband and I were living in Vermont. Our kids were finished with high school and moving on to make plans for themselves. And my husband was working for an international company that had its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. And they were looking to expand their work in John's particular area of expertise as far as marketing goes in Europe. And so they asked him and another guy who had a similar job to his in the company to interview to have a job over there. So it turned out that they preferred John of the two. And so they asked him to move over to Switzerland. We were kind of obviously, but we knew that we were gonna have to leave our beautiful place in Vermont. I mean, Vermont, we lived there for 20 years and we loved it very much, but we knew we were gonna have to leave eventually because this job was just gonna take him somewhere else. So we thought, well, why not go to Europe? And so we decided to, he went over a year before I did and found us a place and did all the stuff that you have to do to get used to living in another country all by himself, which, bravo him. And then I went over and joined him after our daughter got married in June of 99. And so we lived in a little village outside of Zurich and it was an adorable little village. The funny thing was we lived in a very, very modern little apartment complex, maybe, oh, I don't know, 20 or 25 apartments in it, two levels, maybe not even that many, but anyway, and everything else in the village was lovely and charming and old. And we did a lot of, not, you know, now that I think about it, when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of traveling in Switzerland and walking around our village because Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl. So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms, and then they have walking paths everywhere because the Swiss love to walk. And so we could walk like to the next village or through and basically going by the hills, or we could walk through the woods and they had paths going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company, meanwhile, bought a French scale company. John worked for a weighing, in his case, it was weighing heavy duty, like trucks and railroad cars. And they bought a scale company in France. And so we were asked to move to France, which was like throwing me into the fire patch because I was a French teacher. And so this was like the dream of a lifetime actually. And so in Zurich, they speak German, which was okay. That was kind of fun too. But I had taken a little German. My family is German.

We had a big box that our stove wood that we burned in this cook stove was placed in. And I can remember mother sitting on this box of wood and telling me that I was not their daughter. And I knew my actual father and all my brothers and sisters, but I thought he was my uncle and I thought they were my cousins. And I knew their mother was dead, but I didn't know she was my mother. She had died when I was 2 weeks old from childbirth, and I was the baby of 8 children. And the man and woman that took me, she was my birth father's sister and her husband. But first, another family had taken me because I weighed like less than 3 pounds and they just kind of put me off in a room because my mother was really bad sick and they didn't think I was going to live. So another family had said they would take me, one of her brothers, one of my birth mother's brother and his wife. And I remember mother telling me that when she and daddy went up to check on Zama, which was my mother's name, that they asked about the baby and they said, oh, she's in the other room. She'll never make it. She's a little bitty thing. And so they saw about me while I was there and they told them, said, you know, she needs a doctor. They had to go ahead and leave and about a week later, my mother was still real sick, but my uncle, which would have been my uncle, he and his wife had taken me on to their home. And about a week after that, my actual, my mother died and the lady and her husband that actually ended up raising me, the other uncle had called them and said, we can't take care of this child. She needs medical help. We don't have the money. We have a baby. Would you all come and get her? So they came and got me and fortunately, they lived next door to a doctor and mother and daddy were, they weren't rich, but they were well off in many ways, not just monetarily. And the doctor lived next door to them and mother had help in the house. She and even McDaniel carried me on a pillow for six months until I actually was beginning to weigh about five or six pounds. And this doctor that lived next door, Dr. Price, mother said that he, you know, took very good care of me. I was born without a lining in my stomach. I had some bones back here in the back of my neck that weren't very well developed. And so I grew up in this fairly fashionable lifestyle.

At the same time little Susie Mouse is getting hungry so she finds some berries. She's in the she's in the weeds eating the little raspberries.

When we got back, we had way too much food and booze. But I probably went to sleep at one, and then woke up at about five, and went up to the top of the boat. The cabins are down below in the two holes, and then there's this dining room, cabin area, and a big outside area. And then you go up this kind of spiral staircase up to the very top where the wheel is, and the controls for the sails. Although there wasn't much wind, and we were crossing the, we were gonna cross the Gulf Stream, so we were just motoring across. It wasn't good night for Seong. But I got up there, and the two people that were there left and went to sleep. And the other person, there was supposed to be two people on shift, the other person never woke up. So I was just up there, just motoring across the Gulf Stream. So the current was coming from one way, and there wasn't much waves or wind, really. But it was a full moon. And so the full moon was setting in the direction we were going, so we're going east to west. And the full moon was just slowly setting into the water, and gradually there started to be land showing. So the moon was setting, and then the sun started coming up. And when the sun came up, it only lit up the tops of the buildings along that whole miles and miles of development on Fort Lauderdale area. So because of the curvature of the earth, the tops of the buildings were popping up, slowly popping up, being lit up by the golden light of the morning sun. And we're still 20 miles away, and the buildings were getting bigger, they were getting more of them. Pretty soon you could see that everything you could see on the shore was buildings. And I thought I was looking around for commercial shipping and things like that, but I suddenly heard this noise like a horn. What is this? And I'm looking around, and then right next to us was a two-hull inflatable craft with three big outboard engines on the back and a small cabin and several armed men in uniform. And it was the Coast Guard, and they asked me to stop and permission to board, or I don't know if it was permission exactly. So I went ashore and I stopped the boat, and of course there's no brakes or anything, but I stopped the boat. They came on board and were looking up at me and starting asking questions, which I was answering. And then by this time people heard and were getting up, so people were starting to show up on deck. And so he starts asking for the captain, and it's Captain Robbie with his dreadlocks and everything, and asking about our itinerary and what our plans were, and wants everybody's passports. And then one of the Coast Guard guys just starts looking around on the boat and just like opening hatches, looking around, and looking into one cabin where somebody hadn't come out yet.

While her father was caring for Cinderella, he was concerned about having a wife for himself. When he met, Cinderella seemed to be stepmother. Cinderella's father married the woman and had two daughters. Shortly after, they were married and the family was one. The father passed away. After he passed away, Cinderella got to know her family in a different way. Stepmother was selfish, unruly, angry, and this lack of compassion, this lack of caring, led her daughters to be even worse. Because they got no attention, no love, no care from their mothers, they took out a lot of their anger on Cinderella, bullying her, pushing her around, and making her do all the housework. Cinderella was always kind and sweet at heart, and her work made her humble and independent. Cinderella doted on the stepsisters hand and foot, and one day, in one particular day, when they were extremely agitated, irritated, and picking on Cinderella, there was a knock at the door. They were told that there was going to be a ball this evening, and all of the maidens of the land were invited. So the two stepsisters got so excited, they slammed the door shut, they ran up to their rooms, and they began getting ready. Cinderella became so excited. A chance to leave the house, a chance to meet new people, a chance to start over and start fresh, to be seen. So she began getting ready when she was immediately disrupted by her sisters, demanding her help with helping them get ready, putting their dresses together, cooking and cleaning, and taking out all of their extra anger out on Cinderella. So she worked tirelessly all day, helping the sisters, taking care of the sisters, taking care of the mother. Finally, right before the ball, Cinderella stole away. She ran up to her room with the help of her friends, and the creatures that lived alongside her, and had compassion for Cinderella's story. She made a beautiful dress, and she did her hair up beautifully, and with the resources that she had, she looked absolutely stunning. She went downstairs to meet her sisters and join them for the ball, and they gasped at what they saw. She looked stunning, and that made them even angrier. They became so jealous and outraged that Cinderella thought that she could be more than just a servant. They ripped her clothes and her jewelry, bullied her, and told her that she was absolutely unable to come. Cinderella retreated to her room, crying, defeated, disappointed. The sisters went off to the ball, and Cinderella began to cry. Just when she thought she had completely given up, and she was ready to accept herself as just a maid and nothing more to this life, she saw a white light appear, and that white light began to grow, and grow, and grow, until it took the shape of a beautiful, pleasant, grandmother-looking woman. She helped Cinderella up to her feet, wiped the tears from her face, and asked her, Do you want to go to the ball? Do you want to go to the ball with me?

And the stepmother said, oh no, you're not going, you have to stay home and clean the house and get things together and no one will haunt you anyways.

He was in the atomic bomb test. He volunteered for the Navy the week after he was 17, I think, and he went into the service and stayed two years, came back out before he was 19, probably still 18, but they gave him, because his ship was leaving out, they gave him a discharge in the two years. At that time he had to join two years. He was in the atomic test when the bomb was let off, and he was in there and was a coxswain on the ship, and he took the sailors to the bikini, where they had taken them off of that island because of the radiation that would be happening. And he took them over there, and many a time he's pulled them out of the water where they were drinking and back on. Well, he developed cancer, and when he got back to the shore, his ship had a 200-some foot slash on it, I think it was. Well, they took all the men, the sailors, and let them go off in California for R&R, and so they came on with Geiger counters, and the Geiger counters went on that ship, and it went all the way out. He couldn't even take the radiation amount that was on the ship that they were on. Well, they went out and gathered all of those men up and took them back onto the ship, and the captain was taken off and taken somewhere else. They never saw him again. Well, when my husband came home, he had radiation sickness, which they told him was ulcerous, and he was Dr. Fort for I don't know how many years, and then he developed cancer from that, and he had his lung removed, and when he had it removed in the hospital, they were going to teach me how to irrigate him. I had to be irrigated because they had done a... Well, I'm getting a little ahead of myself. First, they taught me how to irrigate it, and he was in the room, and they showed me how to do it and all, and we went home on Christmas Eve, and he was so sick he didn't even know where he was at really, and so the woman had... He developed... They developed a staph infection into his lung cavity when they were doing the surgery, and so he had to go back to the hospital, and then when they were teaching me how to... They did the constant irrigation and killed all the red cells in his lung cavity. This has been a long time, so he's been dead 17 years now, but I can live it over, but I get the times. There's so much that happened, it's hard to remember exactly how it happened because it happened so many times, but they did the constant irrigation and killed all of those cells, and there was nothing in there. It was like a stone wall, and so they put over $10,000 worth of medication into his lung cavity to kill that. Well, when we went home on Christmas Eve, he was bacteria-free, but they taught me how to irrigate it, and there was a container sitting there, and I said, I've never done this before, never watched them do it, so she said, I'm going to show you how. She said, I've never done it before either. I said, if you haven't done it before, do you know what to do? And she said, oh, I know what to do. So she showed me how to irrigate it and how to take care of it, and so when we got through, there was another container sitting there. I said, now what's this?"}, {"filename": "MSUC03b_1508573_1746891.wav", "transcript": "Well, for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me, Cinderella ends up being a maid working for this family. And it was a mother and her two daughters. They were just very shrill and very unattractive young women. Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just very nice. These two were very spoiled and didn't have any appreciation for anything. I mean, Cinderella was so nice, even the barnyard animals loved her. The horse, whoever was out there, mice even. She was a delight. Anyway, there's an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their McMansion, I guess, where they lived, they weren't in the castle. They got an invitation to a ball. The prince was gonna give a ball and Cinderella used to, she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance. And so when news came of this ball, she was also silently very excited about it. But the two girls, of course, they were going, they had an invitation. And somehow, I forget some of the details in between, but there was a fairy godmother who ends up helping, working some magic and Cinderella does go to the ball like a pumpkin that gets turned into a carriage with horses. And she's got a beautiful gown on and she just looks really just beautiful. And the prince, of course, sees her right away and one of those across a crowded room and they danced all night and it was very romantic and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters, was that the stepsisters or was that another story? The wicked stepsisters, I don't know. Anyhow, those horrible faces. So anyway, the one caveat was that Cinderella had to be home by midnight. And you see the clock is striking 12 and she's saying goodbye to the prince. Of course, he doesn't want her to let her leave and she's late, she's running down this large flight of stairs and loses a shoe, one of her glass slippers. And the butler or whoever, Major Domo from the palace was sent around to the town to find who fits into the shoe. And Cinderella gets locked up. The mother, that horrible mother thought that they'd cram the shoe on one of her daughter's feet. And I remember their feet were ugly too. And the mice ends up getting, oh, she was locked in this room. They didn't want her on the scene. And the mice brought her the key. She got out and tried on the shoe. Of course, it fit perfectly. She married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after, one hopes. And I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at that wedding. Those horrible people. All right, so let's move on to something a little bit different. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay, now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here. Otherwise it's an open face. They don't call it a sandwich, right? So it'd be nice. We'll pretend we have two pieces of bread and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread. Then the peanut butter, I put on with a knife on each piece of bread."}, {"filename": "wright67a_391818_630121.wav", "transcript": "No, it's kind of brought the whole family together. I mean, there's funny stories about it. She decided not to eat, and one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge, massive breakfast because she used to love to eat. And we had to tell her, no, Jean's decided she's not eating today. So there's all kinds of stories about it. Well, there was this little girl named Cinderella who was a really cute little girl, but unfortunately, her mother, something nasty happened to her. I think she went to the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years. And so Cinderella had to go move in with her evil stepmother. And her evil stepmother had two other daughters. And the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters, but didn't like Cinderella. So Cinderella and, you know, they're just, this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house. She's got to clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff. So anyways, you know, the mom and the stepgirls, they're kind of reading the mail and they get an invitation to the ball where the prince is going to be there. Like the prince is like this totally hot dude where Cinderella just has totally got the hots for this guy. It's like, he is like on television all the time and she knows what he looks like and is like, really wants to dance with him and stuff. But the evil stepmother says, no, you're not getting a dress. You know, it's like, you know, you're a cleaning girl and you stay home and, you know, clean the attic and stuff. Well, me and your stepsisters, we're going to go to the ball. So they go shopping and they get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelry and new shoes and everything. And they go off and get ready to go to the ball. Meanwhile, poor Cinderella, she's up in the attic and she's crying while they're all going away. And she's kind of just wishing, I wish I could go to the ball. And all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears. And Brunhilde, the fairy godmother says, what's the deal, Cinderella? What are you so upset about? And Cinderella says, I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy. And I like to dance and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff, but that evil stepmother of mine won't let me go. So anyways, there's the fairy godmother gets out the wand and touches Cinderella. And all of a sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking. And then they go out in the garden and they dig up a pumpkin and she kind of does the pumpkin and turns the pumpkin into a carriage. And then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horse that pulls the carriage. And cause you have to pull up the castle in a carriage or they won't let you into the ball. So anyways, she gets into the pumpkin and the fairy godmother even put some air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin. And they went to the ball and they got to the castle and they were able to sneak in. And she's kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies. And the fairy godmother or the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters, they're kind of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her. And even when they see her, they don't even think it's her cause she's so pretty. Anyways, the prince comes in and they have the dance and they're all dancing around and he sees Cinderella kind of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says, I don't know who you are, who are you? She says, well, I'm Cinderella. And he says, well, would you like to dance? And she says, well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure I know how to dance, but I'd love to try. But she doesn't really know that the stepmother or the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes so anyone in the shoes can dance like magic. And on top of that, the shoes will only fit Cinderella."}, {"filename": "capilouto55a_1439478_1677736.wav", "transcript": "In 1993, they wrote this version of Cinderella, and the pictures are quite colorful and very attractive. And regardless of whether you like mice or not, it's an appealing kind of conglomeration. The classic is that Cinderella is a stepchild, and back in the time that this story originated, it was not a good position to be in, because adults didn't have good attitudes toward stepchildren and people who might interfere with the flow of money in and out of the family. So there was to be a dance at the castle where the prince was, and the two sisters, older than Cinderella and their mother, received an invitation to the dance and were quite put up with themselves. Well! Well! Yeah. So anyway, they're looking over their wardrobes, trying to find out what they should wear, and Cinderella doesn't have much in the way of clothing. It's pretty sad. She's decorated with ashes and such from working in the kitchen, because in the kitchen in those days, you used ashes or scouring powder, and it clung to you, it didn't come off your hands very well. Anyway, they all were interested in the dance, and so the two stepsisters were so enchanted with their possibility of cornering the prince that they continued to snipe at Cinderella, but they were so busy choosing what they were going to wear, and that she only had to do twice as much as usual in order to help them get ready for the dance. So the sisters were dressed all up, and Mama acquired a coach from somebody to take the girls, and she led the way out, and they were really overdressed. It was pretty sad, but you couldn't tell them that they didn't look as great as they felt they did, but they didn't. And once they got out of the house, then Cinderella dried her tears, and her fairy godmother appeared on the scene, and they had used what they had on hands."}, {"filename": "wright52a_184860_423108.wav", "transcript": "The request kind of begs the question, our family was in a major accident while at a hotel in southwestern Virginia, while at a resort in southwestern Virginia. We went on a horse and buggy ride in a Vis-a-Vis carriage. Our kids were in the back of the carriage facing forward. We were in the front of the carriage facing back. The carriage started going up a hill. The horse was balking. Without really thinking and moving as quickly as I could, I picked up the kids and got them off the carriage and suggested to my wife that we dive off the carriage, which I did, onto the ground. She tried to step down and got her foot caught and was dragged. I hit my head and dislocated both knees, was unconscious for a few minutes when the kids were hovering around me telling me that Mommy was dead. I told the kids to go for help since the driver of the carriage was attending to the horse and not to the passengers. The kids ran for help. I tried to get my legs back together. My wife was flown to Roanoke Hospital. I drove with the kids to the hospital where I was treated for dislocated knees. My daughter was treated for a head injury. My son was treated for mild pneumothorax. We had to stay there for weeks while my wife recovered. All in all, it was a nightmare. At first, I would be short and curt with people and not work with them. If I was a communicator, I wouldn't be very empathetic, but having lived through this, I realized the problems in communicating. I noticed that a lot of people who have difficulty communicating are aware of their difficulty communicating, which makes them extremely anxious and makes the situation worse. So I tried to put them at ease."}, {"filename": "capilouto01a_0_238234.wav", "transcript": "You ready for me? Well, I guess I'll tell you about when I had my hysterectomy because that was the most serious surgery I ever had. And you asked me if I was very sick. The thing that I felt the most was extreme weakness. It just kind of knocked me down, sapped all my strength. And it took a long time for me to recover. Back in those days, they kept us in hospitals forever. And I was there 15 days. On the 10th day, I actually hemorrhaged. But other than that, I can't remember too awful much about it. Like I said, I didn't have terrible pain, some discomfort at first. And then it was just a matter of lying there in the bed recuperating. And I had, I wasn't allowed to get up to go to the bathroom because I had a catheter for at least the first 10 days. And that wasn't the nicest thing in the world. But I managed. And that kind of pampered me. So it wasn't too bad. It's present. Okay. So we're ready to start? Well, unfortunately, my husband has Parkinsonian syndrome and it has affected his speech so that he doesn't always pronounce distinctly. And the worst thing is the volume of his voice has just faded away and it's difficult to hear him. And so if I have to ask him to repeat it, sometimes he gets irritated about that. But he can do a little better if I ask him to try a little harder than he, it's better, it's more distinct. One thing that I recall, I was extremely frightened when my 13-year-old son ran a huge hook into his hand and had to be rushed into emergency. And then it was so painful for him to have this big hook. I took him to the hospital with a hook in his hand because we were afraid to pull it out. We might do further damage. And so he was sent to the hand group at Jewish Hospital and they had to open his hand and remove it because this hook had left a rusty path. But it was very fortunate that it sort of pushed everything out of the way as it entered his hand because otherwise they were afraid that he was going to have bone and tendon damage. But he healed fine and there were no bad side effects from it. There is a young lady who apparently has fallen into the water and the current is very rapid and she's extremely frightened. But someone else, maybe she was white water rafting because this other person has on a life preserver and he is trying to save her. He is holding on to a tree and I imagine that she is farther down. I can't see her hands. But they're both hanging on for dear life and I'm sure he's there to try to help her.

There was a little boy outside playing soccer with a soccer ball kicking it and kicking it and all of a sudden he kicked it way too hard and it flew right through the window and as it flew through the window it happened to hit the his father who was sitting there on a chair and it knocked over a lamp while his father got up and looked out the window to see what was going on. A little boy wanted to go outside to play but his mother said you take the umbrella in case it rains and so he said no I don't need the umbrella it's not I don't think it's going to rain so all of a sudden he walks outside and he he's got his backpack on and then it starts to rain so he runs back to his mother and soaking wet and his mother doesn't look very happy with him so then when he goes back out he has his umbrella with him.

Cinderella was very happy and she made friends with all the animals and one time the cat came and was being mean and she taught him or got him away from her friend, her friends and told him to, you know, leave them alone and be nice and she was always just doing nice things.

So Cinderella went back to her room and she had a dress in her hope chest and she had a book that showed pictures of other dresses and so she decided to fix up her dress.

And so she created, what is it called, a, I can't think of the word, a carriage with horses out of a pumpkin and she used her magic wand and said, gave Cinderella a beautiful white dress and Cinderella was getting into the carriage and the fairy godmother said, you have to be home by midnight.

She hears tales of a ball and sure enough, the invitation comes and all eligible females in the kingdom are to come to the ball and to meet the prince where he will pick out his wife. So she goes and decides to take her mother's dress and convert it back into her own. The little mice help as well, and they have a wonderful little song that they sing as they do this.

And I wasn't being careful because I was looking through the camera and I took one too many steps to the left from about four feet off the ground and was above an area that was gravel and the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact embedded in concrete. So as I took one step too many and tumbled off the left side, just instinctively put out my elbow to stop myself and the elbow hit and I was lying there for a bit, a bit winded and electricians came over and checked on me and I said, oh, I'm fine, you know, I'll be up in a minute. But then I realized I really couldn't stand up because my leg and the left arm, elbow was swollen up and very, very swollen and I could not move my lower arm at all. So they asked if they should call an ambulance and I said, oh, that's really not necessary and I'll probably be okay in a bit. But the longer I was there, the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg, which turned out to be a very minor problem, but the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I was lying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the 40s that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting shivers and they did in fact call an ambulance who came and when they came over to check on how to get me out of there because it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up and it wasn't really obvious they couldn't just pick me up and get me out of there. But first they wanted to check to see if I'd had head injuries, so they asked me some questions and one of the questions was where I was. So I told them I was at the cyclotron building, but by that point, it was known as the ASAT Hall, which was the Science and Accelerator Technology Hall, but it had also changed its name to the MESS Hall, which was the Multidisciplinary Science and Accelerator Technology Hall and Science Hall. Of course, they didn't know any of that, but the worst question was that I was hoping they weren't going to ask me who the president was, so I said, please don't ask me that.

Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone. The baby also waited expectantly. When Carl was sure it was safe, he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out of the crib and onto Carl's back. Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse. They were going to have such a good time together. They walked down the hall into mother's bedroom. It looked so soft. They jumped up onto the bed and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch. Afterwards, they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity. There, the baby got into mom's powder, perfumed powder, and he dusted Carl's nose. It tickled Carl's nose, but he liked the smell of the powder and he was having so much fun with baby. They played dress-up. Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can on top of him just like a little purple hat. Baby had a hat, too. Baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff. They looked at themselves in the mirror and they smiled. This was so much fun. Next, Carl took the baby to the laundry chute. Uh-oh, what do you think is going to happen here? The baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby. He gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry. Carl jumps down the stairs, gets the baby on his back again, and climbs back up, or runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck.

And the mice and everything were trying to cheer her up, but they couldn't do it. And her fairy godmother appeared. And her fairy godmother asked her what was wrong, and she told her what happened. And so the fairy godmother tapped her wand and turned Cinderella's dress into this beautiful ball gown. And she ended up with some glass slippers. And the mice got turned into a stage man and horses, and she turned an onion into the stagecoach. And so Cinderella was able to go to the ball after all. But the fairy godmother warned her. She said, you have to be home by midnight because everything goes back to normal. And so Cinderella went to the ball. And when she got there, the prince saw her, and he was just like, wow. And so they spent the whole night dancing together and just having a wonderful time. And then the prince was trying to get to know her a little bit better. And then she looked up and saw the clock, and it was about to strike midnight. And so she just took off running. She didn't want the prince to see her in her torn clothes and everything. And as she was running away, she lost one of her glass slippers. Well, she got to the stagecoach, and they get out of the palace grounds. And then right after they get out of the palace grounds, the horses turned back into mice. The stage men turned back into the mice. And so she's sitting there in her torn dress, but she still has one glass slipper. And so she goes back to the house, and like the prince is distraught. He found the love of his life, and then she just ran off. And so he goes around the kingdom looking for her. He's having every girl he sees try on this glass slipper because he knows the one that it fits is the one that he loves. And so he is making his way around the kingdom, and he gets to Cinderella's house. Well, Cinderella's doing chores."}, {"filename": "richardson185_29028_267132.wav", "transcript": "Okay, there was a little boy playing soccer one day and he was in the front yard and he kicked the ball and it went through the window of his neighbor's house. When it went through the window, it knocked over the lamp and broke the lamp and scared the neighbor. So the neighbor walked over to the window and he saw the little boy out there and he was going outside to talk to the little boy about breaking the window and try to see how he could work off repairing the window. Okay, great, thank you. All right, so now I'd like you to do pretty much the same thing. Again, these pictures tell a story, so take a look at the pictures and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. One day it was calling for rain, so the little boy's mother was going to give him an umbrella. He said, I'm fine, Mom, I don't need this umbrella, so he went along his way. He gets outside and it starts raining and he's mad because he realizes he should have listened to his mom in taking the umbrella in the first place. When he makes it back home, he's soaking wet and his mom says, you should have just listened to me, I was right. So the next day, he takes the umbrella when his mom tells him it's going to rain and he doesn't get soaking wet. All right, great, and again, I want you to take a look at this picture. It tells a story, so take a look at the picture and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. One day a little girl was riding her bike and her cat went up the tree. It got stuck in the tree, so she went and found her dad and asked him to get the cat out of the tree. So he went and got a ladder and put it up to the tree and climbed up. Once he got up there, the ladder fell, so he got stuck and the firetruck and the firefighters had to come and get him out of the tree, him and the cat. So they came and they are going to get him out of the tree and get the cat down for the little girl. Okay, great. All right, so now are you familiar with the story of Cinderella? Okay, so I'd like for you to take a look at the pictures in this book. They'll just kind of help refresh your memory. And then once you're finished looking at the pictures, I'm gonna take the book back and I'll have you tell me the story in your own words. Okay. Okay, all right. There was a girl and her mother had died when she was younger and her father got remarried.

We're going to do the same thing with these. So take a look at all the pictures, and then whenever you're ready, you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Alright, so a boy's refusing the advice of his mother, thinking that he's a little bit smarter than that. He doesn't want an umbrella for the day, but she clearly checked the weather this morning, so he goes to school, finds out it's raining, turns around, comes back. His mom's mad at him because he never took the umbrella, and it looks like he dries off and goes back out with the umbrella. Alright, great. And same thing with this one. It's a little bit different. It's kind of an entire scene. So take a look at the entire picture, and then a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, whenever you're ready. Okay, so a little girl lost her cat up the tree, and it looks like her father, or a good Samaritan, went up to try to help.

But she had friends, she was friends with the mice, and the horse, and the animals that were around her house. And so she talked to them, and she would look out her window a lot, and look at the kingdom that was far away, and just wish that she had a better life than the one that she had. And in the kingdom, at that same time, the people that were assisting the prince were planning a ball for him, because they said that it was time for him to get married. And so they sent out a letter to everyone in the kingdom, inviting them to the ball. And her stepsisters and stepmother were really excited, because they thought that they would be one of the ones to marry the prince. And when she heard about it, she got excited too, and so she went into her mother's old trunk, and found her mom's dress. And her mice friends helped her fix it up, and she put it on and went downstairs, but her stepsisters and evil stepmother ripped it up, and so she wouldn't be able to go, because they were mean. And so she ran outside, and she was crying, and when she was crying, her fairy godmother comes, and asks her why she's crying, and she's like, don't worry, I'm gonna take care of it. So she turns the pumpkin into a carriage for her, and gives her this nice new dress, and turns her mice friends into these people to help her get to the ball. And she gives her a pair of glass slippers, and tells her, have a good time, but at the stroke of midnight, you need to be back home, because everything is gonna go back to normal. So she goes to the ball, and the prince is excited to meet her, and he dances with her. And, but they're talking, and the clock strikes midnight, so she's like, I have to go, I'm sorry. And he tries to get her to stop, but she knew what was about to happen, so she leaves, and as she's leaving, one of her glass slippers slips off her feet, and she leaves it on the staircase, and she goes back home, and everything goes back to normal, except for the other glass slipper that she was wearing. So the prince says that he's determined to find her, and he decides that he's going to go to all of the places in the kingdom, and have the women try on their, the glass slipper that she left, because so that he can find her. And so when her stepmother and stepsisters hear about this, they locked her up, and so he couldn't, she couldn't be one of the people to try on the slipper.

But luckily her mice friends come and give her the key so that she can get out, and she has the other slipper. And so she shows it to the prince and his assistants, and they, she puts it on her feet, and then they take her away, and she lives happily ever after with the prince. The end. Okay, all right.

Gosh, I must be tired. I must be a little stressed. I'll try to get a lot of sleep tonight and hopefully it will get better. But it was the first time I had ever been in Seattle and I was really longing to explore. So after that day's conference activities, it was about four in the afternoon, I just started walking the Seattle streets and a lot of them are on hills. So there was a lot of up and down and I made my way to the waterfront and there's a very long water walkway along the pier. I started walking and I noticed that my hip was really sore and I then kept walking because I really wanted to see everything that there was to see in this new place and the pain in the hip was worsening to the point where at one point I thought, gosh, I'm limping. And I ignored it because I have a chiropractor at home who can kind of fix this for me, kind of pops the SI joint back into place and then I'm in good shape. So I remember consciously saying, I'm going to keep going, I'll deal with this pain later. And what ended up happening is I arrived back home and it was, the pain was bad and I had a long flight back and sitting made it worse and I got to the chiropractor and he didn't fix it. And for months, I had the worst case of sciatica ever. I got really scared that it would never resolve. I remembered ruefully the words, I'll deal with this pain later and thinking to myself, gosh, now the pain is dealing with me and let this be a lesson to me. I will never ignore pain again. And I ended up having my first ever cortisone shot in my hip and then it got better. Now can you tell me of an experience with someone who has had a difficult time communicating? Yes.

He tells her goodbye and leaves without the umbrella, and he hasn't gone very far when it actually starts raining. And then it gets harder and harder and harder, and he gets very wet. His feet are splashing in the puddles, and his hair, everything is so wet. So he runs home, and his mother is really unhappy with him. So then he dries off, and this time he goes back out with the umbrella. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella, and her mother passed away, and then eventually her father married again. And he didn't realize that the woman he married was so wicked. But then the father passed away, and so Cinderella was left to the wicked stepmother, and she had two ugly daughters. Cinderella was really pretty, so they were really jealous of her. Then the prince of this little town became of age, and the father, the king, wanted him to marry. And so he announced, had his man, one of his servants, announce that there would be a ball. And all of the young ladies who were eligible to marry the prince were invited to the ball. And Cinderella was so excited about it, and she made herself a lovely dress to wear.

So she had nothing to wear to the ball, and her stepmother told her she couldn't go anyway, that she had to go stay in her room. And she was crying and crying, and her fairy godmother showed up, and asked her what was wrong. And she said, well, she wanted to go to the ball, but she didn't have anything to wear. So the fairy godmother just waves her wand, and boom, Cinderella just appears in this beautiful dress. And then the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a beautiful coach, and the dog and the cat into the footman, and the mice into horses, and away they go in the carriage. Cinderella traveled in the carriage to the ball, and when she entered, she was so beautiful, the prince was just really taken with her, and he danced with her all evening. But the fairy godmother had warned her that she had to be home before the stroke of midnight, because at that point, everything would return the way it was. The coach would be a pumpkin, the footman would be the dog and the cat, and the horses would be mice, and Cinderella's dress would be gone. But she had given her some lovely glass slippers to wear, and apparently she was able to keep the slippers.

So I had a right rotator cuff repair surgery. And, you know, anyway, it was not minimally invasive. They had to open up because there was a, in addition to the tear in the rotator cuff, which was told as a slight tear, there was also a growth around the size of a nickel. And so anyway, it had to be open, it had to be open shoulder surgery. And I went with supposedly the best doctor. And anyway, that night, it was considered a day surgery. That night, the nurse came in and she went to my arm. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? I said, yes. Can you feel this? No, no, no, no, no. So she's like, oh, don't worry about that. She goes, sometimes it takes 24 hours for the block to wear off. And I had a horrible, horrible, horrible night of pain. Like I was like out of my mind in pain. And I kept ringing the buzzer all night. And then like around, oh, I don't know, three, four in the morning, the nurse came in. I think she had me up to here with my pain. And she's like, all right, I'm giving you morphine. And the next thing I knew she came in and she was like, in my thigh. And that was the morphine. And it was around six o'clock, the surgeon came in and he was doing his rounds for the morning. And he said, I heard you had a really bad night and open surgery is very difficult, Bridget. And it wasn't, I guess from the time of the MRI, it went from a partial tear to a complete tear. And the growth that was a nickel was the size of a golf ball. And he also discovered that the bicep was torn while he was in there. And he graphed bone from my collarbone. And so basically he was like all over from collarbone all the way down to the bicep and lots of nerves in there, whatever. So he's like, it was rough. So I understand that. So I said, okay. And then he said, so for the pain, he said, I can give you another block. Now I had one for the surgery. So now it's like, say six-ish in the morning and I was supposed to be day surgery. He said, I can give you another block and it will take you off. He said, but it has to tell you that sometimes with the second block, people lose feeling in their fingers. And it doesn't ever resolve itself. Now I still have the morphine in my system, but yet I remember this. And I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Cause I was remembering what the nurse said that 24 hours and it was kind of like it did concern me the night before. So I was like, I don't know. I don't know. And he said, well, Bridget, he said, you, I got to see everybody else on the floor. So you think about it. And by the time I come back here, you have to have a decision. So I was like, so I was like, but I may never get, he goes, well, it's 50-50. It doesn't happen to somebody, but you know, your chances increase. So boom, off he's gone. And I was like fighting to stay awake because I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school, at high school. And I wanted to tell him, Bruce, do not let him give me the second block, which eventually Bruce appeared. I told him that, I told him everything I just told you. I'm like, I don't want the block. Meanwhile, I was out of my mind in pain. There was a wonderful male nurse. He kept me there till like four o'clock that afternoon. So I surpassed the day surgery timeline. And finally they discharged me. Oh, PS Madison, that was July of 2010. And then I went home and then the next two weeks were just horrific. I had no feeling.

Story of Cinderella. Cinderella lived with her father and her dog. One day, he brings home a new wife and her two daughters. Now the father has to go away and leaves the stepmother in charge. His daughters, the stepsisters, are evil and mean. And the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry.

And Cinderella says, Oh, may I go too? If you get all of your chores done and then help your sisters get ready, then if you have any time, you can go with us. So they give her all kinds of work to do. In the meantime, her little friend's demise helped with getting her dress ready. Now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they don't want. They're no good. So they take them and make her dress. She has this pretty little dress, and she's ready on time. The evil stepsisters take the necklace and the ribbon, and they just rip it right off of her dress. And off they go to the ball.

And there was an opportunity for her uncle to send Cinderella to live with a relative and her daughters, which were Cinderella's cousins. And the hope was that they would all become friends and that Cinderella would enjoy having people like sisters around her. But what happened instead is that she was put in a position of servitude with her aunt and cousins. And she actually became kind of an indentured servant. So she would serve them and clean. And she didn't even live in the house. She lived with the barn animals, who became her friends. And she would daydream in the barn about visiting a castle in the kingdom that was far away. But she could see it in the valley in the distance. But she imagined it would be a long, long distance to ever be able to visit the castle. But one day, an invitation came from the prince that he was having a ball. And he invited Cinderella's aunt and sisters. And she assumed that she could go. And her barnyard friends revealed a secret chest to her, which she opened to a book of magic. And from that book of magic, she was able to conjure a dress and pearls to wear to this event. And she arrived to accompany her kin. And they absolutely rejected the possibility of her going. They ripped the necklace off her neck. And she was in despair. So from this treasure chest and this book of magic, a fairy godmother appeared, a wise, powerful, older woman. And she granted Cinderella's wish of attending the ball. But to do so, she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance. So Cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and new hair and makeup. So she was virtually unrecognizable.

Then when the stepdad died, or the dad dies, Cinderella's left on her own with her stepmom and her two stepsisters and she's kind of made to be, made to be a maid. She, she, God. Okay, and then the next picture is like her playing with a cat. So she's responsible for all the chores. Then they get an invitation to the ball and the two stepsisters are really excited and Cinderella wants to go as well. So the mice make her a dress. With the stepsisters, it's leftover materials, but when the stepsisters see that they, or that her dress is like made of all their unwanted clothes they rip it up. So she's really sad and she goes out in the garden and the god, prairie godmother comes to her and makes her, a, I forget what it's called, not a wagon. I cannot think of that word right now. Really nice dress, a carriage, there we go, with horses, a doorman, I think. She goes to the ball, meets the prince. They dance and then it strikes 12. So she has to leave and in her leaving in a hurry she loses a shoe. So then the next day, I guess he's the king's advisor. He goes all around the kingdom to see which shoe, or to find the girl whose shoe it was. But Cinderella is locked in her room so she can't turn on the shoe. And then the mice bring the key to her. She unlocks the door, goes downstairs, but the stepmother tripped the guy who was carrying the shoe so the shoe breaks. But luckily Cinderella still has one. They put it on, it fits, and they live happily ever after. Okay, great. All right, so I just have one more thing that I'm gonna ask you to do. I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I would take two pieces of bread, put it on a plate. I think I would do peanut butter first.

I purchased my house and I live towards the end of a dead end. And I was so excited because I thought, given the road that I live on, it will be safe to let my animals go outside. And it actually was this spring, it was in early April, quite a long time ago. And I came home and I found my kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home. It was unspeakable. And it was devastating because I came to this place with this vision of safety for my animals. So it was very, very upsetting. And I went through grief and then I did some prayers and time passed and it was coming up on summer solstice. So it was in June. And I started imagining, cause the kitty I lost was a girl. She was my only female. And I thought, my gosh, my household really needs a female kitty. And if a cat would just happen to cross my path, I would consider adopting a female. And if that cat just happened to be a tortoise shell, that would be even better. So I went to a party hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country and she was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born on her land. And there was one left and she was just a little tortoise shell, female kitty. So I took that as a sign that she was meant to be mine. Yeah. Another series of pictures. When you're ready, tell me this story. Okay. The janitor at school was taking a break in the lounge, which happens to be near the soccer field.

And during the first week, the welfare department hired many social workers. And I met another woman who was hired at the same time I was. And we became friends and got an apartment together. And she introduced me to a man who had gone to the same school as she had gone to in Michigan. And that gentleman and I fell in love and we married. It was a very pleasant marriage. It was a church wedding. And the sister that I had gone to visit in Seattle was my maid of honor. And we stayed in Washington. My husband was teaching at Port Orchard, which was just across the bay from Seattle. And we lived there for the first year until we moved back to Seattle. And that was how I met and married my husband. The young boy appears to be practicing soccer because he is kicking a soccer ball, which I assume accidentally goes into a window and breaks the window. There's a gentleman sitting in the living room next to the window. And the ball comes through the broken window and knocks over the lamp. And the man picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window to see if he can tell where the soccer ball came from. All right, a little boy is leaving the house. And his mother tries to get him to take an umbrella with him. But he is so happy not to have the umbrella. And when he opens the door, it is not raining. And so he talks her out of giving him the umbrella. But when he gets out and is walking away from the house, it begins to rain. So he turns around, runs back to the house, and comes back in the house soaking wet and dripping. His mother is very angry because he didn't take the umbrella with him. And she frowns at him. But then he decides it's all right to take the umbrella. And out he goes with the umbrella to prevent the rain from making him wet.

I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guillain-Barre syndrome. And that's a type of paralyzing, it's kind of, I think it was called French polio because the men were from France. And I was on a vacation out over in San Diego with friends. And I started having numbness in my hands and my feet. And I was stumbling. I was having a hard time walking. And I knew something was wrong. And I just, I really kind of thought it was fate. I thought maybe I had a brain tumor or something really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned on going to Universal Studios. And I wasn't in pain. So, but I was just having a hard time walking. Guillain-Barre starts at your fingers and toes and then it works in. So, I can't, I can remember this, going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair. So, by that evening, by the time we all go back to our hotel, I was really quite concerned. I did sleep and the next morning they took me to Scripps Medical Center in the San Diego area. And the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Guillain-Barre affects, it's an autoimmune disease. And he asked me if I had had the flu recently. And I had. And so, the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system. And this was what was happening. So, they told, first they wanted to admit me to the hospital. And I said, no way. I was going back to Phoenix. Oh, and they did certain, they asked me to like shuffle a deck of cards. I couldn't do that. And snap my fingers, I couldn't do that. So, I got back in the car with my friends and my daughter was with us. And he said, if you have trouble breathing, because it can go all the way, it's, you know, affects your muscle, affects your muscles, to find the nearest hospital. But I got back home and it took me about, oh, six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery. For about six weeks, I couldn't drive the car. I couldn't, I could feed myself, but I couldn't cut anything up. I could shower, but I couldn't turn on the shower. I had no strength in my hands or my feet. I couldn't stand on my toes, any of that kind of thing. So, then I started it, wherever it goes, you know, from the inside, from the outside to the inside of your body, and then it stops. And as your body stops, starts healing again, then it was a slow recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit. But I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister. She was living with us at the time. And I just felt like an old lady. And this was over 20 years ago, so I was in my 40s. And I was just holding on to the grocery cart for dear life because my balance was so poor. And I was just afraid of someone knocking me over. But I recovered. I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands. I can occasionally have a hand tremor, but I feel like I'm 99 percent better."}, {"filename": "capilouto22a_121816_359632.wav", "transcript": "Okay, five years ago I was, I am a realtor and I was very, very busy that entire year, it was 2003, I had sold more property, closed more closings than I ever had and started feeling short of breath. So I went to the doctor, like in June, my doctor was in class taking some extra classes for something and so I saw another doctor and he gave me blood pressure medication and I continued to work, work, work, work. Finally in October my doctor came back and I went back to her with a list of symptoms and she decided I needed a stress test because I had never had one and this was a nuclear stress test. So I took my stress test and the doctor turned his back and started talking to his assistant and I thought, uh-oh, and he turned and looked at me and said, you have flunked your stress test and I want you back in one of my rooms immediately, I think you have considerable cardiovascular problems. So anyway, he wanted me to go into the hospital the next day for a heart cath and I told him I was sorry I couldn't do that, I had an appointment, real estate appointment, that was very, very important to me and to the lady that I was working with and he said, what about Thursday and I said, I can't do it Thursday and his glasses are going further down on his nose and he said, how about Friday and I said, that will work, I can do it Friday. So anyway, I go for my heart cath on Friday and he didn't even let me sit up afterwards, he said you have blockages and I want you to have surgery today and so I had triple bypass surgery that afternoon and so that was pretty traumatic because my family never thought of me as ever being sick, it was, they worried a lot about their father but they didn't worry about mom because I was constantly going and doing and everything. So anyway, I had the surgery, my recovery was good, I had a good attitude, I never once got depressed because I felt so grateful that my problems had been found and I could go on and so I went through cardiac rehab at Central Baptist and I did everything they told me to do and I was in rehab for probably about six months and have recovered, however, two years later I did find that two of my bypasses were blocked and it's a genetic thing, I had done everything I was told to do, diet, I had been doing the diet thing for years and so I had to have a stent and then a year later I had to have another stent. So since then I have done well, it's been two years now since I had a stent and I'm back to normal as far as I'm concerned and so I'm just hoping that everything will go well and I don't have to have any more stents."}, {"filename": "richardson21_2251130_2488927.wav", "transcript": "Meowth did the same thing in Pokemon, it didn't end well for him either. So the wolf goes up to Red Riding Hood and he says, What you got there, kid? Because he doesn't have many social graces, because he's a wolf, he was raised in a wolf pack. And so he doesn't know how creepy this is, but he also kind of wants to eat her, so he's a little bit aware of how creepy this is. And Red Riding Hood's like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers. And the wolf says, Show me what you got in your basket. And he rifles through her basket, because obviously he can take it, he's a wolf and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own, because that's smart. And I'm not sure what happens, I guess he just, he's like, he talks to her, that's what it is. He talks to her, and he says, What you doing with this basket, kid? And because she's six years old and not very smart, she says, I'm going to my grandma's with it. She's sick. She is. Up in that hill, you take a left at the lightning struck tree, and a right at the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and then you just keep going straight over the bridge, and there's my grandma's cottage. And she gives him really explicit instructions to how to get to her grandma's cottage, because she's six years old and dumb. And the wolf drops the basket, and he says, Oh, that sounds great, bye, I'm never going to see you again, don't look for me at your grandma's place, I'm definitely not going there. And he bounds off in the direction of the lightning struck tree and the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And Little Red Riding Hood says, That was completely ordinary, I see nothing suspicious about this. And she picks up all the stuff and puts it back in the basket and starts going on to grandma's. And obviously, before she gets there, the wolf gets to grandma's cottage, and he listens at the door, and he hears grandma singing along to Led Zeppelin, and says, Grandma clearly can't hear me, because she's singing along to that heavy metal music. So he opens the door, and he knocks grandma out, and ties her up and put her in the closet, where she just sits there kind of sniffling and humming Led Zeppelin to herself. And he turns down her crazy tunes and gets into her bed. No! No, he has to take her clothes first, he's a weird wolf, social graces, not his forte. He gets grandma down to her underwear, puts on grandma's nightie and her cap and stuff, he doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too, but he puts on her night cap, and then he ties her up and stuffs her in her closet to sniffle and hum Led Zeppelin. And he gets into her bed, and he pulls the covers up, right here, and waits for Little Red Riding Hood. And Little Red Riding Hood comes up to grandma's door eventually, probably like half an hour later, because she's six, and she knocks on the door and the wolf says, Oh, come in, dearie! Little Red Riding Hood says, that's weird, my grandma never calls me dearie, but I trust this situation implicitly. And so she comes in, and she looks over to the bed, and her first response is not, there's a wolf in my grandma's bed. Her first response is, Hi, grandma! I'm six and I'm stupid! And she goes up to the bed and her grandma says, Oh! Her grandma, the wolf, says, Oh, what did you bring me, dearie? And she says, Well, I brought you stuff from my mom, because I heard you were sick from dancing naked in the rain. You need to not do that so often, but you should also tell me what to do, to dance better in the rain naked. And the wolf says, Okay! He doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain, he's got a fur coat on at all times, but he's willing to improvise."}, {"filename": "richardson21_405805_643550.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella lived with her father, and presumably her mother died. I think that's what happened in the original story, I don't know what Disney said. But that's not important, because what is important is that when she was a little girl, a little cheerful girl, very nice, her father remarried to this not-very-nice woman who had two not-very-nice daughters, who had big noses and angry eyes. And basically, I'm pretty sure her father died also. I don't remember that from the movie, I figure it must have been too tragic for kids. But it's a grandmother's thing, they kill everybody's parents off. So Cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters, and no parental oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the slave of this family, she doesn't get paid. And her only friends are the cute little furry animals, like mice and dogs and horses. There's a cat named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure. Aptly named. There's a cat named Lucifer who belongs to the stepfamily, who is always terrorizing her mice friends, and so she has to protect them. They're all, you know, good buddies, they sing songs together. And then, one day, the king, in the castle, up in the distance, very far away, Cinderella looks longingly out the window, because she wants something she can't have, because that is the fundamental facet of human existence. The king says to his advisor, I want my son to get married, because he's getting on in years and he wants a grandkid. Pretty much is his only motivation for that. Which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your heir apparent to get married to me, but the heart wants what it wants. And so, the king decides to throw this enormous ball to which every single eligible maiden in the kingdom will be invited. And by eligible maiden, I mean probably over the age of 13, and not already married. The throwable is probably negotiable. So, the stepfamily and Cinderella get the invitation, and they're all psyched, because this is great, one of them could marry the prince, not Cinderella, obviously, because she's hideous and not worth it, but one of the stepdaughters could. And so, leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns, and they're all excited, and Cinderella, her mice and bird buddies, make her a dress, because they want her to go to the ball also, because they're just nice. They're good friends. And so, Cinderella sees this, and she gets so excited, because this means she can go to the ball. And she puts on the dress, and she goes downstairs to meet her stepfamily at the door, for them to get into the carriage to go off to the ball. And they say to themselves, Nah. And they rip her clothes, and make her dress completely unwearable, so she can't go to the ball, because they're mean. And, at this point, Cinderella's kind of crying to herself, and I'm inclined to be like, crying to herself, because she's a baby, but also, I would probably cry, because that was a nice dress. And like, if mice and birds made something for me, and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she's sitting there crying, and all of a sudden, her fairy godmother comes. Why she has a fairy godmother, nobody's really sure. Presumably, because she's so pure of heart. But her fairy godmother comes, and says, Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

I had determined that it's a four-year course, and I had determined that she enjoyed it so much, I was going to take the course this year as a first-year student. Meanwhile, the two people who were the mentors, administrative mentor and class mentor last year, decided not to return, they were both from Berea. So Sharon agreed to be a mentor, and I was drafted to be the administrative mentor, who takes care of the paperwork and sets schedules and things like that. I have to know nothing theologically to be an administrative mentor, I just have to be able to do paperwork. We have six members in our class, and one is a lady who is in a wheelchair, who has in the past attempted suicide. She is a neat lady, and she has a lot of difficulty communicating, and one of the things that I've learned to do in talking with her is to be very patient while waiting for an answer, and sometimes I have to ask the question two or three times to get the answer. But I'm learning to have more patience, and it appears to be working. The most important event that comes to mind right now is the fact that I got married in October of 07. I had known a lady named Sharon for 30-something years, in fact I trained her. I met Sharon in the late 1960s, I trained her first husband as an equipment salesman for a central school supply company, and we had been friends ever since. And upon the occasion of a divorce in 1991 in Henderson, Kentucky, Sharon and I had remained friends, and I called her, came to Lexington to visit, and lo and behold, we began a relationship, which lasted for some 17 years, 16 years, 17, and it worked out very well because my children had known her forever, and they all loved her. She is a great person. And in December of 06, for Christmas, I gave her an engagement ring, which surprised her an astounding many, but we proceeded to be engaged for about 10 months. And on October 28, 2007, what I thought was going to be a small intimate wedding at St. Michael's Church turned into a grand gala affair with a couple hundred people and a reception that was real well done. A lot of friends from Louisville came, a lot of Sharon's friends came, and we just had a grand time.

I'm sure he does get her rescued, but boy, she's in a really dangerous place. Cinderella was a beautiful little girl, and she had three stepsisters, and the stepsisters were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful, and so they didn't treat her very well. She had to do all the scrubbing and the cleaning while the stepsisters went about their way and had the pretty clothes and all that. There was going to be a ball at the palace, and it was for the prince to try to find a bride, and so the stepsisters were very excited about the ball, and of course they weren't going to let Cinderella go, and so they got all dressed up, and they went to the ball, and Cinderella is just very upset that she couldn't go. She's just kind of wistfully looking out the window at the palace, and suddenly her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she wants her to go to the ball, and she dresses her in a beautiful dress and has a carriage waiting for her outside drawn by horses, and I believe it was a pumpkin, or maybe it turned into a pumpkin, anyway. So Cinderella goes to the ball, and she gets to dance with the prince, and he just really is, he just really loves her, thinks she's really beautiful."}, {"filename": "NEURAL15-2_1412369_1650007.wav", "transcript": "And she didn't know what to do.

And her fairy godmother asked her what was wrong. And she explained. And the fairy godmother said, well, we can take care of that. You'll be able to go to the ball. And so the fairy godmother waved her magic wand. And the vice and a pumpkin that were sitting there turned into a coach, the footman, the driver, and the horses. So they were able to have a coach. But Cinderella still didn't have a dress. So the fairy godmother waved her magic wand. And Cinderella got a beautiful dress, just magically appeared on her. It was a very beautiful dress. And her hair was all done up nice. So she was able to get into the coach. And the fairy godmother told her, only one thing you need to do. You need to be home before the stroke of midnight. Because after the stroke of midnight, the chariot, looking for my word, the carriage that she went in after midnight would go. Everything would change back to what it was. So she went to the dance, the ball. And the prince saw her. And he was just taken with her. And he went and asked her to dance. And they danced many dances. And her stepsisters and her stepmother didn't recognize that it was her. So she danced and she danced. And then she started to hear the stroke of midnight. And it was like, oh, no, I've got to get out of here. So she turned and she ran. And she was running down the stairs. And one of her shoes fell off. It was a glass slipper. But the right-hand man was following her. And he picked up this glass slipper. Cinderella got in the coach and went away. And it all changed back to mice and pumpkins. So on the way home, she got home. And it happened that she was there. And she was so happy that she had had the chance. Well, she was showing the mice her one glass slipper that she still had. And the mice were excited about that. And the prince went to the right-hand man and the king and said, I want to find this girl. So the right-hand man and another guy went to all the houses in the village looking for the person that could wear that glass slipper that they found. And they tried it on all the women. And they got to Cinderella's house. And the stepsisters tried the shoe on. But their feet were huge. And they couldn't get it on. And the stepmother had locked Cinderella in her room because she had gone out without knowledge. So the mice helped her get out of the room by unlocking the door for her.

I have asthma that is very well controlled, but I had a host of different kinds of less controlled moments growing up with asthma before there were the quality of maintenance treatments that there are now for asthma. My asthma is most frequently triggered by allergy issues. In particular, I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle because they're non-shedding dogs, and I am allergic to all cats very badly, and I'm also allergic to, you know, trees and various molds, grasses, yada, yada, yada. But cats are probably the worst culprit for me. So when I was in high school, probably a freshman or sophomore in high school, I think, my sisters were out of the house at that point, so it was just me living with my mom and dad. And one summer, we took a vacation down, no, it was in the fall, it was in the fall, and we went down for like an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why, did not really think about the fact that they had two dogs and a cat, I believe, shedding dogs and a cat. So we were going to stay two nights with them. So the first night came, and we were in their home having dinner, and I could tell I was starting to feel, and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother, having been my mother, always could look across the room, and when we would be in somebody's home, and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say, it's time for you to go, isn't it? So we kind of reached that point, but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room, people try that kind of thing, which of course never works because the animal lives there. And I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there, but we did. And, or maybe I said, oh, I'll be okay, I'll be okay. I took medicine, and whatnot. But by the middle of the night, I was beyond okay. And it was, you know, to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe. And there were no inhalers back in those days. It was liquid medicine that A, was less effective, and B, took a long time to activate. Plus, if you stay in the space where the stimulus is, your medicine's only going to last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night, I could bear it no longer. And my loving, loving father said, let's go to the car, and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night. And I, so then the next day, I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were, but we spent enough time in the house. I just couldn't get past it. I was, I was so affected. And I am not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did stay in that house that night, but it just continued to get worse. And by that next evening, we had to go to the ER. And back in those days, I suppose they do something, well, there were no, um, now you would go and you would get a breathing treatment."}, {"filename": "wright89a_332060_569660.wav", "transcript": "OK, I am a school nurse, and I have a program in my school. It's called SMD, which is Severely Mentally Disabled Children. And these children have traumatic brain damage, or they're severely disabled, where they barely can function. They are in wheelchairs. All their ADLs are done for them. They don't communicate at all verbally. And so basically, the only way that you can communicate with them a lot is by their affect, by the way maybe their eyes, how their eyes are turning in or out, or if they're looking at you, the way that you touch them, maybe just communicating some of them. Well, I have several classes. There's another class that's MOMD, which is a little more advanced. And so in that class, we communicate by sign language, like this would be please, or something like this, like the doctor or the nurse. So sometimes we do sign language with those kids, and we can communicate with them that way. OK, the beginning of the story, it looks like there is this little girl, probably between an 8 and 10-year-old little girl. And somehow, I don't know how she got into a raging river, but it looks really cold. And the fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her, and he has all his equipment on. And basically, he has to go out into this raging river, and he's grabbing onto some kind of tree limb, a branch or something for his support. And then he's got some kind of a build or something to pull her in or to help her in. But he's also out there in danger in his life, too. OK, there's this little boy, probably 10, 12 years old. And he's out playing soccer, just having a really fun time. And the ball goes through, possibly maybe the neighbor's window, or maybe it's his own front window. And the ball knocks over a lamp. So actually, it breaks the window glass and also a lamp. And the man was sitting in a chair, and then he picks up the ball, and he looks out the window. And that's all in those pictures. So I don't know what the end of the story is. I don't know what the little boy does. I don't know what the little boy does. I love this one, because this is typical, typical of kids and mothers. So the little boy is getting ready to go to school. He has a backpack on. And his mom says, I think it's going to rain today. We take their umbrella. And the little boy goes, no, I'm not going to take it. It's not going to rain. Trust me. Kids think they're smarter than the parents, but they're not. And the mom says, you need the umbrella. But he doesn't take it. So what happens? He goes outside, and it starts to rain. Ha, ha, ha. And so the little boy comes back home. And he's soaking wet, and he comes back in. And his mother is a little upset with him, because in her mind, she says, I told you so. Why don't you listen to me? And he's sopping wet. And so he takes the umbrella, and he goes to school.

Now, for some reason, it does not change back. Before you ask me why that doesn't happen, I had kids who asked questions. So she keeps running. Eventually, she gets home, back to her hearth.

The little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined and his mom was trying to hit his dog.

On one side, you spread the peanut butter. And on the other side, you spread the jelly. And then you put the two together. Oh, my. In about 1984, 85, it's been a long time, I had my four wisdom teeth extracted. As a precaution, I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so that I wouldn't get an infection. Because when I was seven years old, I had rheumatic fever. And they always told me, well, your immune system isn't going to be near as strong. So make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery, including oral surgery. So I did that. And that evening, early evening, my throat swelled up. I don't know if it was from the penicillin or what. But I ended up back at the dentist's office. And they ended up having to take some epinephrine. They gave me shots of epinephrine, I think two of them. And they also took a syringe and sprayed it on my throat to help the swelling go down. Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with something called angio. They called it then angioneurotic edema. But it's since been re-diagnosed or reclassified. It's now called hereditary angioedema. The difference between angioedema and hereditary angioedema is that angioedema, which is like the hives, can be treated with antihistamines. Hereditary angioedema cannot. It has to be the only thing that, until recently, the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine. During that time, shortly after I was diagnosed, my throat again swelled up, just out of the clear blue. I went to urgent care. In urgent care, they started an IV on me. And the doctor, I don't know if she was a doctor or a PA. Anyway, she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline in the IV. And anybody who's ever had adrenaline knows that's the wrong place to give it.

So he found a woman with two daughters, and they decided to marry. So now little Cinderella, his daughter, has two stepsisters. They grow up in the house together, but they're very, very different children. The two stepsisters are very vain, very selfish, and force Cinderella to do all the work in the house instead of them helping out. And the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen. So Cinderella, because she works so hard, has no friends except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house, and they befriend her. She sees the prince's castle from afar and often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle as a princess. Meanwhile, in that castle, there's a prince, and the prince's father is very frustrated because his son is just not interested in meeting women and marrying, and the king is definitely ready for his son to get married. So he decides to host a ball and bring all the beautiful ladies of the area to the ball. And so he sends out invitations, and when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations, the girls are very, very excited because now they can see themselves married to the prince. And Cinderella also shares in this dream. However, Cinderella's stepmother says, oh no, you can't go to the ball because you have too many chores to do, and forces Cinderella to do even more chores because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters and does not want that competition for her daughters. So they get all ready to go to the ball, and Cinderella goes through all her chores, but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also, so they help her with the chores. But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball because she doesn't have a dress. And so in a puff of magic, her fairy godmother comes to her and says, I will help you, Cinderella. So she makes a beautiful dress appear with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball that is made out of a pumpkin. And the mice, she waves her magic wand and makes into fine horses that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball. So in the meantime, just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though, she says, remember, the spell is only good until midnight. And after midnight, the coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will turn back into your little friends again. So make sure you're out of there by midnight. So Cinderella goes to the ball and nobody recognizes her because she's dressed beautifully, she's clean, she smells good. And the prince is so taken with her, he cannot believe his luck that he has found this beautiful young woman and falls in love with her instantly, love at first sight. But as they're taking one of their last dances, she hears the gong from the clock tower and knows that it is midnight and she knows she has to leave quickly. But he doesn't want her to leave and he holds her back and she says, no, I must go.

One of the things that I have been doing for the last 10, 12 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis at Riley Children's Hospital. And it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So I very much have learned from that, A, not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them. And that is a lesson because it's easy to make that assumption, as I'm sure you know. So I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact, from their facial expressions, from their motions that may be jerky, that may be just excitement, that that is a response to the story. And while I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understanding and capacity with this story, I can sense their emotional response to whatever it is that they do understand in the story. And it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection even when there is no speech coming back on their end.

I had the good fortune of having a fairly benign, you know, easy pregnancy. And nothing had happened, nothing had happened. We were on to day five after the due date. And that day was singing in a very unusual thing, singing with a choir that I was part of, a small chamber group, I should say, that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So I went to the wedding and we sang. And I did kind of notice that, you know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but you know, whatever. And the wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial.

And eventually, my allergic reaction was traced to my tonsils. And my tonsils, so they took away my tonsils. And I remember being fed ice cream, all the ice cream you can eat, after the operation. And once that was taken away, I was back to normal. One of the things that has stuck in my mind, as I say, I can't remember exactly, but I think I was about four. And this thing went on for about three months. So one of the things that I remember was that I was not supposed to move very much. I was supposed to be in bed and not moving very much. And whenever I was left alone, I would remember that I would jump on the bed as a sign of rebellion against this doctor's order that I was to stay, you know, just lie as still as I could, which was impossible to expect a four-year-old to do all of that. So that's one of the things I remember. I also remember the doctor coming in to, because I was put in my parents' bedroom, which was larger than my own, during the day. And just one of the images I have was this doctor would come and he would take the lampshade off a side table lamp and put it on my head as a hat. And he did that like three or four times. And then I didn't like it that much, but he kept doing it. He thought it was a funny joke. So it's one of the things that I'm stuck with. But so that was not a stroke. It wasn't a mental thing, but it was an allergic reaction to my tonsils. So the next thing I'd like to ask is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? That's a very broad range of what we could mean by that. But if you could... My mom died of Alzheimer's. Okay, so that you can probably... In that case, please tell me kind of what the issues or problems were and what you did to try to communicate with that person. Okay. I, of course, stood sort of second row to the problem. My father-in-law and my wife at the time were the most affected by it. And I remember trying to find things that she would be able to have a conversation about, which as the illness progressed, it became more and more difficult all the time. But I was the one trying... She was a music teacher, so I was trying to talk about music and kinds of music she liked. And then at some point, she would give some responses that were totally coming off the wall."}, {"filename": "richardson173_265214_502667.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so there was a girl named Cinderella and she got two new stepsisters and a stepmom and they were really mean to her. The stepsisters were very full of themselves and vain and they didn't like her and knew they did the stepmom. So she did all the work around the house and she played with the animals and she swept and did everything. And then she dreamed of going to the palace and like having a better life. And one day the stepmom got an invitation to a ball at the castle and she was, well, the stepmom and the stepsisters were very excited and they began to get ready. And then she, Cinderella wanted to go as well but they didn't want her to go. And so she put on, she didn't have the best dress and then she put it on and then they ruined it and pulled her necklace off and broke it and everything. And then they all left to go to the ball and Cinderella was at home and she started crying and then her very godmother appeared and like told her that she could go until midnight. And then she had a carriage made out of a pumpkin, horses and a nice dress and her hair was done and everything. And so she went to the ball and everyone was like amazed at this beautiful person and they wanted to know who it was. And she danced with the prince but then she realized it was almost midnight and so all of her stuff would turn back to normal. And so she went back outside and was running off and her glass slipper fell off. And then when the prince was trying to follow her but he couldn't catch up to her but he found the glass slipper. And so she got back home, her stepsisters and mom came back home and they were all excited and they didn't know that she had went. And then the next day, the prince was going around trying to find someone whose foot fit the glass slipper. And finally she tried it on and it fit and they went off and got married and lived happily ever after. Excellent, okay. And then last for this first test, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. So first you would need to wash your hands and then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread. You take the tie, there's usually a twist tie on the bread. So you take it off and open the pack and if it's a brand new pack, you probably wanna throw away the first piece, the end piece, you probably don't wanna use that. But you grab two pieces of bread and you can put them on a plate or a napkin separately and then you go and grab a knife and peanut butter and the jelly. And so first I'm gonna choose either the peanut butter or the jelly, but let's just go with the peanut butter. So you'll twist the top off of the peanut butter and stick the knife into it and get some peanut butter on the knife and then you'll use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread. And then you'll go, when you finish spreading the peanut butter, you'll go and wash the knife off and then you'll open your jar of jelly. It's either, it's probably gonna be a twist top as well, so you're gonna twist it and use the knife and spread the jelly with the knife on the other piece of bread."}, {"filename": "capilouto80a_1057361_1294808.wav", "transcript": "You can't help not liking Cinderella, and applaud the good things that happened for her.

But the scene opens with Mama and the two daughters castigating Cinderella, treating her like an adopted child, which is, of course, what apparently she is. And then the scene shifts, and there the king and his staff are working out the details of a party that they're going to have. And they send an invitation, which comes to the mother of this family, and she and her daughter, the two daughters, are wonderfully happy to receive it, and proceed to buy nice dresses and get all prepared for it. Meanwhile, Cinderella is not asked to go. And there's a sad scene of her looking out the window of the palace. And then there is justice in the world. And out of nowhere appears the fairy godmother, who's a nice, well-toned lady with a big smile, but more important, she makes possible all manner of good things, including a coach and four horses and a beautiful dress and glass slippers. So Cinderella dons these and whisks away to the ball. And there she has a wonderful time. But the godmother tells her, you must be gone, you must leave before midnight. Or the carriage which I made out of a pumpkin is going to become a pumpkin again. Well, as luck would have it, Cinderella is having a wonderful dance with a young prince who's tall and handsome.

And in fact, her two daughters were equally unkind. They were very cruel. They insisted that Cinderella do her laundry, do their laundry, and bring them tea whenever they wanted. One day, Cinderella was looking looking out the window at the at the palace, at the palace far, far away in the distance, the castle where the prince lived. And one day, the family received a letter in the mail, an invitation, because the king had become very concerned that he had not found a suitable wife for his son. And so he decided to give a ball, a big dance, and he would invite all the young women in the kingdom. And so he sent out his invitations, and one arrived at the home of the widower and the stepmother and the three daughters. And the two older daughters were excited about this. We will go to the ball. Maybe the maybe the prince will choose one of us. And Cinderella was looking over their shoulder, and she was also reading the invitation. And she thought, well, I could go to that too. And so we she went up to her room, and she looked in her trunk. She looked through all of her things, and she found a dress, a pink and white dress, that she thought probably would work. And now the animals in this household were very sympathetic to Cinderella. And the two little mice were watching, and they were cheering her on. So Cinderella put on her lovely pink and white gown, and she went downstairs to show the other, to show the stepmother and the two stepsisters. When they saw her, they were irate and angry. And they said, you cannot go to the ball with us. You're just a Cinderella. You're just a little chambermaid. And with that, they began to rip off the ribbons and the other fancy attire. And so Cinderella had to go back up to her room. And the stepmother and the stepsisters, not only that, they locked her in her room. So that there was no possibility of her leaving to go with them, when they went off to the ball. And Cinderella sat in her room, weeping. Suddenly, do-do-do-do-do, sparkling stardust fell upon the room, and there appeared the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said, why are you weeping, Cinderella? It's because my evil stepsisters and my stepmother will not allow me to go to the ball. And I wanted so much to go. And they tore apart my part, my dress, and now I have nothing to wear. Oh yes, you do, said the fairy godmother. And with that, she waved her magic wand and stardust fell all over the room. And suddenly, Cinderella was clothed in the most beautiful white gown. And her hair was done up in a very fancy hairstyle with a hairband. And she was absolutely beautiful. And the little mice cheered and said, how wonderful she looked.

So she was always getting jobs to do and never was able to do them to the liking of the evil stepmother so she kept just getting more and more jobs to do.

I have to go back a ways because I have never broken a bone in my body, so the only time I had to go to the hospital was when I was seven. I was playing you know skip or something on the playground at elementary school and hopscotch and I tripped, I'll never forget it, there was a twig that went from one section of the ground to another, my foot hit it just right and I plowed right into the bent that was along the brick of the school. Do you know what I'm talking about? Man, my head hit that and it sliced open my forehead right here. Oh my goodness gracious. And you know what, it didn't even hurt at all because I guess it was so sharp the blood started coming down. So I was rushed to the hospital and they had to sew me up and believe it or not about a week afterwards I was kind of playing with it and I accidentally opened it back up again. So then they took me back to the emergency room and they did a butterfly thing and after that it was I was fine. That's the only time I've been really to the hospital. Now I can't say it was terribly traumatic but there you go. Have you had any experience with someone or people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that kind of broad, any issues communicating? I have two people. Okay so what I'd like is you can you can choose one or both but just kind of tell me what the issues are or were and kind of what you do about those issues or did. Okay well the first person that comes right off the bat is my nephew. He's autistic. He's non-verbal autistic so of course he'd be the first person I think of. I don't get to see him too often. He's always on his iPad but he's grinning a lot. He grins a lot. He's 21 years old and what I do is I smile at him and I try to hug him. Sometimes he lets me, sometimes not and I'll just say it's so good to see you, Nicholas. You know the only thing you can do is just really smile and keep him at ease because he can get very upset. So I can't say I do a whole lot for him because I don't know how to deal with autistic children but it sure is good to see him when I see him. Did I answer your question? Okay. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened in your life, happy or sad and something from childhood or more recently just something important that happened that you could tell me a short story about? Yes, I can. Well wonderful. Okay. Okay. Approximately 22 years ago, my oldest brother Eddie collapsed in a stairwell. It turned out he had total renal failure. One kidney was at zero percent, the other one was at ten percent. He was on dialysis for two years, was having troubles with it. We decided to get tested to see if we can donate a kidney and I already knew that I was going to be a perfect match. I actually knew that and sure enough I was. In fact, not only was it a perfect match, the body has six blood antigens and Eddie and I both are missing two, either one or two, one and it's in the same location. It's weird. So the doctor said that not only do we match better than twins, the kidney should last at least 20 years."}, {"filename": "capilouto11a_6480_243757.wav", "transcript": "Well, the task is, how does one make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? To start with that, you have to take two pieces of bread, select the type of bread that you best like to eat, because a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a dining experience. You should select the type of peanut butter, again, that you most like. I like crunchy peanut butter, and therefore I would have crunchy, preferably extra crunchy peanut butter. To make the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you would want to take a knife and apply about one quarter inch of peanut butter, evenly over an entire slice of bread. Finally, select the type of jelly or jam that you best prefer. I would prefer probably strawberry preserves with big chunks of strawberry in them. On the other side of the bread, I would apply, again, another quarter inch or so of strawberry jam, put it on really nice and thick. Put those two pieces of bread together, it should be cut in half and it should be eaten immediately, immediately with a cold glass of milk. In this picture, there is a series of unfortunate events. It looks like it all started with a cat that climbed up into the tree, maybe after a bird. The cat is sitting, actually it almost looks like it is sleeping very comfortably in the branch. A little girl is standing and jumping underneath the branch, trying to get the cat to jump down, but is unable to do so. She is unhappy. That was followed by her father climbing up into the tree using a ladder to help get the cat down. Unfortunately, the ladder fell down while he was still up in the tree. He is stuck in the tree now. Meanwhile, the dog is furiously barking at the base of the tree because dad is stuck up in the tree and the cat is as well. Someone has called the fire department finally to bring another ladder to help get both dad and the cat out of the tree. The firemen are quickly running over to the tree to help everyone out. The injury I am going to tell about was breaking my left collar bone. I was approximately 22 years old. I had just graduated from college and was in Peace Corps. I was in Thailand in Peace Corps. In Thailand, you drive on the opposite side of the road as they do in Great Britain. I was driving a motorcycle down the road. It was a small country road. I was going to pass a dump truck going relatively slowly. Just as I got beside the dump truck, the dump truck made an abrupt right turn directly in front of me. I ran into its gas tank. I went flying off my motorcycle into the ditch by the side of the road. The truck stopped immediately before actually running over the motorcycle. At that point, I knew something was wrong. I was not very comfortable but not in horrible pain. I was in the ditch. A driver came over and asked me if I was hurt. I thought something might be wrong but wasn't sure.

The stepsisters were very mean to Cinderella. They actually picked at her, made fun of her. And as she grew up, she always wondered as she looked out the window what it would be like to live in the palace. Soon, as she got older, she saw that there was an invitation to the grand ball to meet the prince. How exciting this would be to finally go and meet the prince and possibly one day be able to live in the palace. The stepsisters were all getting ready to go as well. And the evil stepmother was making sure that they were going to be greeted by the prince and have an invitation of their very own to meet him in person. Oh, Cinderella thought, I wonder how I would get to the ball. So she opened up a chest. And there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were going to help sew the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace. Soon, the stepsisters found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince as well. And they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress. Oh no, Cinderella thought, now what shall I do? How will I ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil stepsisters? Then, out of nowhere, a beautiful good witch showed up. And she granted Cinderella a wish. The wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city that nothing would ever compare. She would also grant her a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince. The only exception was that she would have to be back by midnight, or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin. Oh, this is so wonderful, Cinderella said. Yes, I have to go. It is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball. Then I shall grant you your wish, said the good witch. And there she was, standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine. Crystals and diamonds everywhere, and the beautiful horse carriage. And off she went to the palace. There, everyone stood in line to meet the prince. Finally, Cinderella got her turn. And there she was. Oh, no, she said. It's almost 12. I cannot finish my dance with the prince. So she hurriedly ran down the stairs. And as she ran down the stairs, one of her glass slippers fell off. The prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered, who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown? Minutes later, Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit and her rags. And no riches anymore were on her.

He said, I'm proud of you. He said, you said exactly what I wanted you to do. So we didn't have it done. And he lived eight years that he wouldn't have had, the doctor said, for the care that I gave him. And so during that time, I started to change the tube. I couldn't get it in. And it scared me to death. So I called a surgeon, which was a cousin of his, to tell him that I couldn't get the tube back in. He said, go over to the hospital and let them do it. Well, I took all of the things that were sterilized and told the doctor at the hospital what to do. And he couldn't do it. So he goes up to the fifth floor to get a surgeon. And he comes down, a little fasty man with a black mustache. And he reaches over to get a pair of gloves off the wall. I says, no, you can't use those. Those are not sterilized. He said, it wouldn't hurt him if I picked up something off of the floor and put it in his back. I said, let me tell you right now, he's laying there because of your negligence. You're not about to put something in his back. And he looked back at me and the two nurses that stand there, they looked at me. And he left out of the room. And he told the man to go get him some sterilized scissors. He turned around and he sterilized. And so he took those scissors and he was going into his back and was going to stretch that area to try to get that open so he could get the tube in. I says, no, you're not either. You call this doctor right now. He's not about to be done that way. And so he left the room and he came back with a wheelchair. And he said, I'm going to take him up for x-ray. The doctor wants you to come in on Monday. This was on a Friday. And to have a scan done. And so he wasn't very happy. The nurse says, what's wrong with you? And I told them about what had happened. And they said, aren't you afraid? I said, I'm scared to death but he needs help. So they took him upstairs and the doctor had us go over there. We never saw that doctor again. I don't know what happened to him. I think he lost his job. I don't know. I'm sorry about that. But I wasn't about to let my husband go through another ordeal of the negligence. And so anyway, it wasn't about a month that after that, I developed hepatitis. And he had to stay and take care of me. I was put to bed. And he had to wait on me. I couldn't even lift a cup. And if I had been clean, having to take care of his back, there was no way that I could. I wasn't able to. And so God's plans better than ours is. He healed his back is the way I felt. That the doctor said it would never be the rest of his life. He healed his back so he could take care of me. And then as soon as I went back to work, they told me I'd never work again. I went back to work because they said he would be better if I was working. And so I went back to work. He developed cancer of a different kind in the other lung.

And I said, yes ma'am, Mrs. Stanford, yes ma'am. No, I'm not married, I'm single. The city director says you're married. She had a hard time convincing me of that. Anyway, things progressed. We had a very short courtship. And the funniest part was, she would come up to, I was living about 35 miles north of Ashland in a small community on a lake. She came up and she would go to church with me on Sundays. And then after mass, we would get together with four or five of the couples and the priests and go to the local joint and have dinner. And this got to be kind of a habit. And she would drive up every Sunday. And then we would go back to the lake and read the paper or whatever. And finally I proposed. I mean, she encouraged me. And so we decided, it was sort of early June. Now, we hadn't even known each other more than five weeks. And it was sort of early June and it was kind of a rainy day. And I said, well, let's take a ride and go someplace nice to meet. Well, we came down. We ended up at Nashville. We went all over the place and nothing was open. And we stopped at a little town across the river from Maysville called Aberdeen at a truck stop. Had something to eat. Went back up to the cabin, up to the lake. And it was getting sort of, starting getting dark. And she had to drive back to Ashland. That's 35 to 40 miles on a windy road. And I said, you better get going. And she says, not until I call my mother. And I says, what are you going to do that for? Well, I'm going to tell her we're engaged. And I says, you are? She says, yes. So she called her mother and she hands me the phone. And I says, well, you ought to talk to her. Well, her dad comes on the phone and I introduce myself. And I said, I'm supposed to speak to your wife. Oh, pat, pat. He's yelling and both of them are hardly hearing. And I could hear, he's on the phone, he's on the phone. She ran over to the phone, picked it up. And she says, well, did he? And I says, yeah, I sure did. We both had to be on the phone. And that was the start of a great marriage that's still going on. What we have is a story of a boy kicking a soccer ball, having a good time. Picture number two. That ball gets erratically kicked and it goes through a picture window. Lands in the lap of the man of the house who's reading the newspaper.

And she walks home and she gets home and says, well, that was a pretty good night. I probably won't hear from that guy again because I can kind of tell maybe he was not all there either. So the prince, he gets up the next morning and says, hey, I think I can go for that gal. And all he has is a glass slipper. So he tells all of his people, he says, listen, we've got to find that girl. And so they go out and they begin to look and they check all around and they come up to Cinderella's house and the two stepdaughters are there. And the two stepdaughters, they come out and they look and they say, oh, I know I can get that shoe on. And if I can get that shoe on, bam-o, I'm going to be the princess. So the prince is standing around and he says, well, you don't really look like the one I was dancing with last night or last week. But here, try on the shoe. Let's see if it works. And the first one tries it on and it's too big. Her foot won't fit into a size 10 army shoe. And the second one comes over and she tries it and she can't get in it either. And the prince says, hey, is there any other girls around the house here? And they say, no, there isn't anybody. And Cinderella, on the other hand, is looking from the kitchen where she's scrubbing the floors and she hears this and the prince says, wait a minute, I just saw somebody in the kitchen. And they say, oh, that's our stepsister, she doesn't, you don't even want to see her, she's too ugly. And so he goes in and she's pretty scraggled, her hair's all a flitter. She's in a charwoman's dress. And he says, well, I don't know, she looks a little familiar. You know, if she had a good buffett hairdo and a white dress, I'd probably recognize her. So he tries on the slipper on the Cinderella and it fits, fits like a glove. And he says, were you there the other night? And she says, yes, it was me, I was dancing with you. And he says, really? And he says, okay, well, how come you're not in a nice outfit? And she says, well, my two stepsisters and my stepmother, they keep me tied up here in the kitchen. And he says, what? And she says, yeah, they keep me tied up in the kitchen, I can't get out, I don't get to do anything. And he says, well, we'll take care of them. And so he says, come on, let's go, let's get out of this hellhole. And so they get, he picks her up, he takes her over to his carriage and they go back to the castle. The king is ecstatic because he's found, he knows that the prince likes the girl, probably friends, but that's all right. And the prince and the girl, they get married.

And the symptom was that I would get these purple rashes. So the cure, ultimately the cure was to have a tonsil operation and have my tonsils removed. The process was a very long, in fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose the cause of the illness early enough. So for a long time, they were trying to figure out what was wrong. And then I remembered my family changing the physician. And then this physician who saw me for the first time says, we need to, we need to take out his tonsils right away. And so I was bedridden, and I had to stay in bed, but the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down in the bed just to show that I could do it and contradict the doctor's orders. So that was my most traumatic bedridden experience other than flu, two or three day flu or stomach virus. That was my major illness. And I was late going to kindergarten. So I always remember, I spent some time trying to catch up with the rules. Everything was the way it had been for about a month. And I could not join them until a month later. So I was playing catch up in kindergarten. Our next prompt, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And this is kind of an open topic, any type of difficulty communicating fits. But what we'd like is for you to tell us what sort of problems there were with communication and what you did about it. So for about a year, I was a teacher. I was teaching Spanish. I'm very fluent in Spanish. And I was teaching Spanish at Salva Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island. And one of the students in my class would completely refuse to do anything. He would not answer questions. He would not respond, would not participate. He was excluding himself from the classroom, every class, every class. So eventually, I said, okay, I have a problem here. I tried different things to, you know, make making him a silent participant in in plays or games or whatever. And he said, silent participant in, in plays or kids that we would put on in class. Even that meant met with very partial cooperation. So I called him to a meeting. And then he told me a very long story of how his parents had spent so much money tutoring him, or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through high school, in math, in English, everything. And he had this aversion towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish the reason why he was not participating. He could have been just making it up. But I think he was, at least he made the effort of coming to the meeting to explain to me why he would not participate. And I took that as a positive move on his part."}, {"filename": "UNH1018_1025730_1262870.wav", "transcript": "I'll look at the picture first.

So there once was a young girl named Cinderella. She lived alone with her father and one day married an evil stepmother. Although she didn't know she was evil at the time. And along with the mother came two very nasty stepsisters. Now, the stepmother and stepsisters treated Cinderella very poorly. They made her do all the cleaning up, all the washing. Even though the family was fairly well off and could afford to hire servants. Cinderella's father was most often away. So that left her alone to the mercy of her evil stepmother and stepsisters. Now, Cinderella grew close to the animals that her family owned. The horses. The mice, not technically owned by her family, but living in the house. And the birds of the forest. And could get them to help her with the chores. One day, Cinderella found out that her family was going to the prince's ball. She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it. She took her time and made her own dress to go with her family. Because her stepmother and stepsisters would not allow her to be a provided woman. And upon learning that she had planned to do this, her stepmother and her stepsisters tore the dress from her. Tore into it and made it unserviceable to go to the ball with. Now, after her stepsisters and stepmother had left to go to the ball, a fairy godmother came to Cinderella and told her that she could help her get to the ball on time and charm the handsome prince. And to do this, she transformed a pumpkin into a carriage, and the mice, the horses, and the birds into appropriate helpers for Cinderella. She also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers. She, however, told Cinderella that Cinderella had to be back by midnight, or else the magic would wear off. Now, Cinderella went to the ball and had a fabulous time. She was noticed by everyone upon entering, including the prince. And the prince asked her to dance, choosing to dance with her over the two stepsisters, neither of whom recognized her. Somehow. She enjoyed her dance with the prince so much that she lost track of time. And just before it hit twelve, she noticed that the time was about to be up. So she ran from him without an explanation. He chased after her down the steps of the palace. She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running. The prince stopped and picked it up, knowing that he could never catch up to her as it were. She managed to just escape the castle before the magic wore off, leaving her back to looking like plain old Cinderella. She went back to her house, thinking that would be the end of it."}, {"filename": "NEURAL5-2_1135775_1372892.wav", "transcript": "she saw all of this disaster happening.

Once upon a time, there was a woman who had two daughters. She had been a widow, and she met a man who had a daughter of his own. He was a widower. The two fell in love and got married, but that meant that they then had a blended family. Well, the two daughters of the woman did not like the daughter of the husband of the man. In fact, they made her work in the cinders, cleaning up the house, cleaning up the ashes and the cinders in the chimney, and they eventually just called her Cinderella. They were unkind and made her serve them. But Cinderella was a kind, kind soul.

And he when I finally was allowed to see him, he was on a gurney. And he was propped up and his eyes were open, but there was no response, it was very vacant. And I did all the things you think, like squeeze my hand, blah, blah, blah, blah. He did nothing. There was no sign that he was there, except that his eyes were open. And that was the beginning of a very, very long, you know, recovery. He was paralyzed and couldn't speak and really just wasn't present. And we had this go on for several days in the ICU until he started improving. And he was in the hospital there two weeks, and in a rehab hospital for four weeks. And then he came home. And he was able to walk at that point. Not well, but he could walk. And went to outpatient therapy for a year and a half. Until the day they said, we don't think he can return to his job. And they said, given that you have private disability insurance, if he does a job trial, it might show that he can do a lesser job. And that might not benefit you both financially. And that was that day was the end of therapy. There was no easing into it. It was done. Goodbye. That's it. At which point I picked up the phone knowing that while he was physically probably where he was going to be, knowing he had so much more to do with speech. And I called started calling around and I'm a nurse. I know who to call. And I was amazed to find out that Indianapolis has no university based speech programs at that time anyway. And I eventually I called different hospitals at the Med Center and they told me that all the speech was in Bloomington, which I should have known because my sister graduated from that program back when it was not rehab, it was all school, you know, therapy. And I called down there and talked to the secretary that answered. And that was the beginning of our relationship with with the Bloomington Speech Clinic. And we traveled for 12 years. We drove to Bloomington every week. And he gained a lot from it. And we made a lot of wonderful friends between the therapist and the other clients we met. And that led to me eventually starting a program here in Indianapolis. And it's the only thing up here for that's a support group. And it's modeled after the program in Bloomington. Here's another series of pictures. When you're ready, please tell me this story. All right, we have a young man who's out playing soccer practicing, and that soccer ball gets away from him and smashes through a window.

My children, when the car came to a stop, don't remember anything about the other driver or where they were, but I can almost visualize the moment that maybe I came to and my oldest son was able, he was in the front seat, he was able to open the door and run for help and I remember telling him, this I do remember, I remember saying tell Richard I need to call Richard and tell him I need it and so fortunately there was a home very close and he ran and used the phone and of course they called 911. So my husband was on the opposite side of the city and hit the car and came flying all the way across and the younger child was in the back seat and he, I don't remember looking at him, but he didn't seem to be hurt.

He came back to the hospital by the time he came back, I think I was having test run. I don't remember any of this part except for having a reaction to some IVP guy and I have a flash of being in an elevator and I remember that I felt hot and sweaty. It's weird that I remember the reaction, but that's all and I don't, I just remember hot and sweaty. It was a bad sensation. I was in the hospital for two weeks. I had pelvic fractures, ribs, concussions and I would call my mother. I could remember her phone number and from the very beginning, I would call her constantly and I'd say hi, where am I? Hi, where am I? Bless her heart, she just, she'd answer the phone and answer the questions and hang up and we'd do it again. This went on a lot, but as the days went by, the concussions got a little bit better and I remember they took me to a whirlpool bath and using, you know, a whole harness system to lower me into this tub and I'm not sure it helped, but it felt good.

One day then, the king of that castle wanted his son to meet women in hopes that he would become married. And he sent a notice across the village and everyone was very excited, including Cinderella. And so her stepsisters were starting to get all of their things together, what they were gonna wear and what they were gonna do. And Cinderella did the same. She found a book to help her make something and the animals helped her make something. And then her stepsisters were again, so jealous and envious of how beautiful she was that they ruined her dress. And Cinderella was very sad and her fairy godmother appeared and turned everything into the most beautiful things ever. Her dress was prettier, she had a lovely carriage and horses to drive the carriage and she went to the ball. When she got there, the prince wanted to dance with her because like everyone else, he noticed that she was the kindest, gentlest, most beautiful creature in the room. And so they danced and danced and Cinderella noticed it was almost midnight and her fairy godmother had told her that at the stroke of midnight, everything would turn back to normal and that she needed to be out of the castle by then.

And, um, like if she probably should be hospitalized, she's very, very dehydrated, but we don't want to take the risk of putting her near any other infection. So we're going to see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated and get her temperature down. I think I'd had a fever too. And, um, my husband came home cause he was so worried.

This is a story about the time when I was kicking a ball in our yard and it went into our neighbor's window. Our neighbor was a very intelligent young man by the name of Richard Jenkins and Richard was a writer and also a professor of literature. So when I sent the ball crashing through his window I thought he was going to be mad and I was very reluctant to go fetch the ball but eventually I did and he said look I will let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me. And that is how I started writing and I fell so much in love with writing that ever since I have become a writer and I haven't been published but I have a lot of writings that started with that incident that Mr. Jenkins induced after I broke his window. Okay so here is a series of pictures. Please take a look at all of them first and then tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. So this story is about my Aunt Charlotte who was a very mean old lady and I remember spending a night in her house because of the pandemic. We had to, we were caught by a lockdown in her house and I did not attend school but I did go to a tutor's house because of course there were no teachers to a tutor's house because of course there were no schools but one day I was getting ready to go to my tutor's home who was doing supplementary work so that I wouldn't miss out on school that was cancelled and it was raining. It was raining very hard so I asked my Aunt Charlotte for an umbrella but she said no I'm not going to let you use my umbrella. So then I had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realized two things. One that I was getting wet which was not comfortable I did not like that and the second one that I had a very good excuse to get a hold of the umbrella. So I went back to my Aunt Charlotte I said look I could get ill and who knows I could get I could catch coronavirus because of getting ill so the only way to prevent this is by you lending me your umbrella and so faced with this incredible threat of course even a mean old lady like Aunt Charlotte was would not dare to deny me the umbrella so she gave me the umbrella and I was able to walk to the tutor's house with the umbrella. Here's a picture I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end.

Same thing with those pictures. Just take a look at them and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end whenever you're ready. Before the boy was leaving for school, his mom told him to bring his umbrella because it was supposed to rain that day. And then it did start raining and he did not look very happy about it. He came home, his mom saw that he was all wet, and then he ended up taking the umbrella back into the rain because he learned his lesson the first time. Okay, great. Same thing with this one. It's a little bit different. It's an entire scene, so go ahead and look at the entire picture and then a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end whenever you're ready. There was a man walking down the street when a dog started chasing after him. So he ran and climbed up a tree, but while he was up there, there was a cat that was also running from the dog that climbed the tree and got stuck. And the cat's owner was very concerned, was trying to get the cat down. And so the firemen had to come with their ladders and help both the cat and the man up the tree. All right, excellent. Okay, a little different. Have you ever heard of the story of Cinderella? Of course. Okay, so I'm going to have you look through this book. There are no words in here, just the pictures, but take as much time as you need to look through all the pictures.

However, he forgot to let go of the sled. So as he went down, he pulled the sled behind him and as he got to the bottom and stopped, the sled came down and hit him right in the face. I, of course, am yelling at him to get stand up and come back up the hill because, I don't know why, but when I looked down and I saw that there was blood all over the snow by him, so I ran down and not realizing how bad it was, I picked him up and I just took him back to our car, at which point I looked and he had a huge gap across his face where the sled had hit him. So my husband took my daughter home and I got to rush my son to the children's emergency room. They took us in right away because obviously he was spouting blood all over the place. And we got to bypass all the people that were there for their runny noses and all the other things in the emergency room. We went right back in and saw an ER doctor immediately. And of course they decided that it was too serious for them to deal with. So they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face. However, there had been a car accident somewhere else. So this plastic, it would have to be a pediatric plastic surgeon because my son was only five. So this plastic surgeon was off somewhere else dealing with people from the car accident. So we just had to sit and wait. So we waited and we waited, try entertaining a five-year-old in a hospital bed for about eight hours while we waited. And we played all kinds of video games. We looked at fish in a tank. I mean, he got to the point he'd stopped bleeding. So we were just walking around. And of course we couldn't eat or drink anything. Well, he couldn't because they knew he was going to be going into surgery. So I, of course, as his mom, didn't eat or drink anything because I didn't want him to see me doing it. And finally they came, the plastic surgeon came in and they decided he needed to go into surgery. It was about 2 a.m. And we went into surgery with the doctor, one nurse, and for some reason, me. I went into surgery with them and they got out this, this is all my son remembers, this huge long needle to anesthetize his face. And when they got the needle out, he of course started screaming because it was a very long needle. And for some reason, the doctor told me that I needed to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia. And so I held him down and they gave him the shot. And then I stood up and since I hadn't eaten for eight, nine hours, and I'm diabetic, I passed out on the floor of the operating room. And then they had two patients to deal with. And I, it was strange, but they just brought me some orange juice and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery. So they gave him about, I think, 42 stitches in three layers underneath his nose, going from inside his nose down to his lip. And about an hour and a half later, we walked out of there and we went home and that was the end of the story. All right, can you tell me the story you see in these four pictures with a beginning, a middle, and an end? One sunny day, a little boy went outside and he decided to kick a soccer ball around and he was playing and playing.

And he's behind me and knows that I need coffee but for some reason thinks it's a good idea to hand me my coffee mug while I'm driving the motorbike and I'm not thinking because it's morning and I need coffee and I go to grab the coffee mug and next thing we know, of course, the motorbike went, whoa, whoa, whoa, and then boom, I go on this, I didn't hit my head or anything. I mean, I had a helmet on, but I did fall on my shoulder very hard and broke my collarbone. So I got up off of the road and all of the local Thais come running and they're checking on the motorbike to make sure that it worked and I'm sitting on the side of the road going, oh, this is not right, this is not right. My boyfriend at the time said, oh, maybe you need to go to the hospital and I said, I absolutely need to go to the hospital. Well, get on the bike, I'll take you there and I said, no, thank you. I'm never getting on that thing again. So we tried to hitch a ride and the only car that came along that would give me a ride was a truck full of Thai monks who can't sit next to a woman even though this woman is injured. So I have to kind of sit in the front and away from this monk so that I don't touch him and then it's as I'm going down the mountain and from side to side I can feel it's getting more and more painful. So then they dropped me off at a, I tried to tell them, we get down to the bottom of the mountain and you could go to the right to a sort of country hospital or go to the left and go to the big city hospital and I was trying to tell them in Thai, please turn this way and telling them the name of the hospital, Chiang Mai Ram, Chiang Mai Ram and they didn't take me there, they took me to the country hospital. So I go to the country hospital and no one knows what to do with this foreigner and I'm sitting there looking and I can see like morphine right there and like something, I need something but no one is helping me and all these people just keep walking around and so I just got up and walked out to the highway and I caught a taxi and I caught a taxi to the other hospital in the, which is a taxi there is a pickup truck so you have to get into the back of the pickup truck and the driver was a woman, taxi driver which was really strange because it doesn't really happen all that much and she was very kind and didn't even charge me because she knew that I was in pain. So then I go in the hospital and I go up to the counter and it's just the regular part of the hospital, I didn't go in the emergency because I just wasn't thinking. I was just like, this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English, I've been in an accident, I am hurt, I need help now and they hand me this form and tell me to fill it out and I have a broken bone so I can't.

But when the stepmother and the two daughters saw this little girl, they said, oh, we don't want you with us. We're gonna call you Cinderella and we will let you sweep the cinders from the hearth and we don't want you in our lives. Well, Cinderella was very sad about this. She went out to the barn where she talked with the horse and the dog and there were some little mice and she would go out there and talk with them when she was sad and they all became friends. One day, a letter arrived from the king. Now the king had a son, a handsome son, a prince, who was in need of a wife. And so the king decided to give a ball and invite all the fair ladies of the land to come to this ball in hopes that the prince would look them all over and find one that he would like to have be his wife. So the stepmother and the daughters were thrilled when they got their invitation. Yes, we will go. One of you surely, said the stepmother, will be the one that the prince will choose. Well, Cinderella heard about this and she said, I can go too. And so she went up to her room in the attic and she opened her chest and she pulled out a gown that she had and she put it on. It was pink and white and very pretty. And she ran down to show it to the evil stepmother and the two sisters. And they said, oh, you cannot go to the ball. And they began ripping off the ribbons and the lace. And pretty soon the dress was in tatters. Cinderella ran back up to the room and she was in tears and she cried, my beautiful dress, I have nothing else that I can wear to this party. Suddenly, the room was filled with light and there appeared someone she had never seen before. Who are you? She asked to the strange apparition. Why, I am your fairy godmother, said the woman. My fairy godmother? Yes, and I am here to see to it that you too shall go to the ball. By this time, evil stepmother had locked Cinderella in the room. But the little mice came and brought the key and managed to get the door open. And now here was Cinderella in her beautiful, beautiful white garment with her hair done up in the most beautiful hairstyle you could imagine with jewelry, it was gorgeous. She was gorgeous. And so she came down the stairs from her attic and she appeared downstairs in the living room. And then not only that, the fairy godmother saw to it that one of the pumpkins in the patch became a beautiful carriage. She did this by simply waving her wand.

Yes, and the horse suddenly became six horses."}, {"filename": "wright21a_674893_911761.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella is a young girl living with her father, whose wife has died, and he decides to remarry. When he remarries, the woman that he brings home has two young daughters, Cinderella's new stepsisters. Her father dies not too long after he remarries, leaving Cinderella alone with the new wife and the two stepsisters. As they grow older, Cinderella is made to become a scullery maid, while the stepmother indulges her daughters, and they treat Cinderella very poorly. Cinderella makes friends of the barn animals that are at the house where she is, mice, horses, ducks, that sort of thing, but the stepsisters and the stepmother still don't like her. One day they receive word that there's going to be a grand ball, and all the young ladies who are eligible to marry are requested to attend, as the king wishes his son, the prince, to marry. Cinderella and the stepsisters are very excited to hear this news. Cinderella goes to her hope chest, where her mother has left her some dresses and patterns. Cinderella uses these patterns and dresses, and the assistance of her friends, or her animal friends, which include some very savvy mice, to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella to attend the ball. The stepsisters and stepmother find out that this is what Cinderella has planned, and in a jealous and angry fit, rip Cinderella's dress to shreds. Cinderella, crying, runs out into the courtyard where her fairy godmother visits her, tells her that she will send her to the ball, and waves her magic wand, creates a new beautiful gown for Cinderella, as well as a coach with footmen and magnificent horses for her to ride in. Cinderella arrives at the ball, catches the eye of the young prince, and they dance the night away together. At the stroke of midnight, Cinderella, remembering her fairy godmother's words of warning that she would have to leave the ball at that time, leaves the ball. The prince is upset and tries to follow her. In her hurried rush to leave, she drops one of her shoes, a glass slipper. She makes it back to the coach and is about halfway down the road when it goes back to being a pumpkin and she's in her standard scullery clothing. It is heard that the girl that the prince was dancing with disappeared and that he's looking for her. The king sends out his archduke to try to find the girl. The duke has the glass slipper in hopes of finding a match to a foot. They get to Cinderella's house.

I spent a day in the hospital to make sure everything was all right. They kept checking on me. My regular doctor came in, who's a cardiologist, and he came in to check on me, too. They told me to watch my diet, not to smoke, which I hadn't for a couple of days, so I just decided that was it, and to do some walking, to be more active walking, which I'm off and on on that subject. That was about it on my recovery. It was very mild. In communication, I think the problem that I have most is with my son. We're not as close as I think either one of us want to be. He's very closed-mouthed, I don't know much about it, what his life is like. I talk to him maybe once a month, once every five weeks. There isn't a lot that we talk about, a little bit about his work, not too much about my life because I'm retired now. We both are avid baseball fans, so we do talk about that, and that seems to open up the lines of communication more so than anything else. I guess one of the nicest things or greatest things that ever happened was when I was single. My first wife had passed away, and I had left Ashland and was living sort of a secluded life on a lake. I came in to see my dad, and I stopped at the filling station, a large one, filled up with gas. Hey, grandfather. It was my daughter-in-law, and what are you doing here? I said, well, I'm here to see you, Dad. I said, where are the girls? At that time, they were like preschool. She says, oh, they're over at Ashland Child Development. I says, oh, you're doing some shopping? She says, yeah. She says, I met the lady that runs that place, and she wanted to know about you. I said, oh, is that right? I said, who is she? Well, that's Diane. She gave me the last name, and I said, did she ask about you and what you were doing and this and that? I says, where are the girls? I said, well, they're at the child care center. I says, well, I guess I could stop over and see them. I said, what did you say the lady's last name was? Stanford. Okay. Well, I went into a men's store that I'm good friends with, and I walked in, and I said, Betty, that's the owner's wife. I said, are you a city director? She said, yeah. She's sharp.

Well, it's an ongoing affair after 25 years. My husband's aphasia is moderate to severe and after having chemo six years ago, it's even worse. It actually had improved and the chemo really made a difference. Excuse me. So I have, and you'd think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget. And one of the things I have to remember, he just a little bit ago left, in fact he's still gone, to the hardware store. And things I would have not done before, I make a list of what he was going for because he might forget. And then he has to explain to the people there. Although he has had so much therapy that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants. It's very rare there's a failure there. He draws a lot of little tiny pictures. But I've learned that to be sure, it's hard to remember to verify all the time. And he doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend. And maybe he thinks he comprehends. So how do you discern between those two things? That's quite difficult. Him, does he think he understands perfectly? Or does he not understand and does not really wanna say he doesn't understand? So things like that make it very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him, he can take it to the bank. He totally understands if he sees it written. I know not to ask him numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. I did find out in the last week that he can repeat, thanks to you. And that is something he has never been able to repeat, not even one word. And now he seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he can tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask him to repeat a word. It's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability that's... I've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man, because other women are more caring, more empathetic, less frightened. And I think men are not, in general. So there is this learning curve. For men, they have this discomfort, and so it's just easier to avoid. And I always feel badly for him because he is left out a lot. And I've always felt like it was my job to be an interpreter to explain to people what's wrong and please don't interrupt and please turn the TV off or please turn the radio off or you don't have to shout. Although I don't find that so much, but some people do. People are not comfortable with disabilities they don't understand. And even if they understand them at first, they feel awkward because they don't know if it's sensitive and it's going to upset you to talk about it. And they always tell me, we've been doing this for 25 years. We're not going to get upset about it. It's just what it is.

And they were unpleasant to her because she always seemed to make everything look happy and bright even animals cheered up when they were around her because she just let off this gift of light and love and the sisters were very jealous and the stepmother was very jealous also. So they mistreated Cinderella and had her do terrible things that none of them wanted to do. So Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the wall she lived in. And the castle, there was a family obviously who lived there and the prince was looking to find love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all everyone in the entire village come to this ball. So Cinderella's stepsisters got all of their their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things and Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball and since her stepmother and her stepsisters didn't help her, all of the animals did. So the animals who loved Cinderella because she was so good put together a beautiful gown for her and just as Cinderella thought she was gonna get out of the house, her stepsisters and her stepmother ruined her gown and she was very, very sad and the stepsisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with ripped up dress and nothing to do. So this fairy godmother showed up and said, Cinderella, you are such a nice person, you're such a good person and you have so much love to give and you're so much light, I really want you to go to the ball. So I'm going to create a horse and carriage and a new outfit for you and it's gonna be so lovely but it ends at midnight so you have to make sure you come home before then. So Cinderella goes to the ball and her stepsisters were not pleased because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in because she was just so beautiful and the prince of course noticed her beauty and grace and again, this kind of calm, light, soothing to people that she let off and he danced with her and just then she realized it was almost midnight and so she ran out, she lost one of her shoes and she didn't even make it home when everything went back the way that it was.

I was diagnosed about three months after I retired in 2011. I had symptoms before then, but didn't connect the dots. I had night sweats, I was tired, and didn't think much of it. But then I noticed that I was losing weight, and that's what caused me to seek a doctor. So I went to, I hadn't been to a doctor in years, so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now our physician for both of us. She did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram, because she palpated and she felt something. The lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram, and that was positive enough for me to have a CAT scan and a PET scan. That led to the need for a biopsy. So by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong. The decision was gonna be, is it, it was lymphoma, but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma? So I went to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy, but that wasn't enough. Not enough tissue was obtained, so I had to go into the city, into New York, to Sloan for a more complete biopsy, and that clinched it. It was Hodgkin's lymphoma. Which, in the great scheme of things, was the better of the two. Hodgkin's is much more treatable, at a higher success rate. So I started chemo, and after the first session, I developed a rash, and we weren't quite sure what was going on. One of the nurses, the oncologist wasn't sure, and he was gonna proceed with treatment for the Hodgkin's, but one of his nurses said, this is an allergic reaction. And it turned out, it was a severe allergic reaction to allopurinol, I think I mentioned this last time, which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout, but it has the protective effect for kidney function. That landed me in the hospital with what's called Stephen Johnson syndrome, which is treated like a burn. People with Stephen Johnson are often sent to burn units. My mouth was inflamed, it was just off. I couldn't drink water, it burned. That, of course, suspended chemo. We worked through the Stephen Johnson. I was looking forward to chemo. It was so bad that the chemotherapy was gonna be the vacation. So, and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather, but still, I couldn't take solid food for two weeks or so, nor water. It was, the only thing that really worked was iced tea.

It could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently. It was February, 1978. It had been snowing all day, and in fact, that was the year when we had the blizzard of 1978. And we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon on this day in February, when my husband came home from work, where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church, he said, Carla, come in the house. I want to tell you something, want to ask you something. So I said, okay. And so I followed him in, taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He said, sit down for a minute. So I said, okay, I'm sitting, what do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years? Kenya, I said, where's Kenya? He said, it's on the equator where it's hot, no snow. I said, count me in, let's go. And so we did. He had received an invitation to come and work with the National Christian Council of Kenya in a family life education program where he would be responsible for setting up a counseling center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in community health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun, let's do it. And so four months later, we had sold our house, our car, most of our household possessions with the exception of a few that were stored by a friend. And our family of four, my husband, Ted, our two daughters, Michelle, age nine, and Cindy, age five, and I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, Pennsylvania because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran in background and he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite mission program. Well, who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to a 10-day orientation period in the heart of Mennonite country in Akron, Pennsylvania, where we spent 10 marvelous days getting to know the Mennonites and also a group of other people who were about to embark on Mennonite-sponsored mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three-year period of high adventure for our family, one of the best times in our lives.

It was like, okay, yeah, this is real. It's, it's time. And so on the way to the hospital and my husband, I think this was my first child. You know, you get them kind of confused. Anyway, he's of course, you know, like, no, my gosh, you're going to have a baby right now. And, and, and so of course I was having contractions in the car at one point he was speeding, like he was speeding and, and he barely would stop for the lights and we all continue to laugh because my words were, I yelled at him to slow down and said, it's not about you, it's about me. And I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous, but he and I just always laugh at that. Still to this day, it's not about you, it's about me, which was a stupid thing to say, but you know, who's rational at that point. So we got to the hospital and she was born at about 1135, boy, what kind of a mom am I? I don't even remember. Somewhere after 1130, because I remember when she was born then that I was thinking about what date it was. It was the 14th and that somebody had hoped that if I'd had it on the 15th, it would be on their birthday. And I had, you know, missed that window. But anyway, so it, you know, of course, that's incredible when you hold your first child in your arms for the first time. But I was exceedingly grateful that it was a relatively quick delivery and, and, you know, that's not to say it didn't hurt, Ashley. That's not to say it didn't hurt, but it was a, you know, a great experience all in all. And, and then we had our first baby. Wild. Now she's 22. Is that enough? Also tell a story, take a second to look at them, and then when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with a beginning, a middle and an end. Once there was a boy named Sam. Sam loved to play soccer, but it was during the coronavirus pandemic. So Sam could not play soccer with his soccer team. The best he could do was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around. He kicked and kicked and kicked, and eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbor's house. His neighbor was an adult man named Ferdinand."}, {"filename": "richardson196_32523_269170.wav", "transcript": "uh... so johnson's playing with his soccer ball outside it was a recently and you know sometimes it when you're practicing some soccer uh... things get a lot of hands instead of soccer ball went through the glass window of his neighbor uh... mister willis who is in the middle of watching the just relaxing and the soccer ball lands right in his lap so there was no escaping that uh... so then he picks up the ball and looks outside and sees jonathan who is then running away because he realizes that he made a terrible mistake against mister willis okay excellent so we're going to do the same thing with another one take a look at these pictures and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end uh... so james is on his way to school he walks to school every day and his mom said you know james you should take your umbrella i really think you should take your umbrella it's supposed to rain today and james was like no mom it's sunny right now it's going to be fine i'm not going to take the umbrella he probably wouldn't say it with that vernacular because he's like seven but he goes outside it starts raining and he's like oh no oh no i don't have my umbrella my mom was so right so he runs home in the rain and gets all wet all his books get wet in his backpack he gets home and his mom is less than pleased with him uh... because he's dragged his wet shoes and self into the house and she's looking very sternly at him and so now james is always sure to pack his umbrella because he does not want to get in trouble again okay we're going to do the same thing with this one this is a little bit different it's kind of a scene so take a look at the entire picture and then you can tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end so a man philip was walking down the street and uh... he gets a little startled by this this growling dog that had jumped the fence of you know a house in the neighborhood this dog had jumped the fence and was very ferocious so the man got scared and switched his pace from walking to a full on sprint and in the in the way of how fight or flight works he climbs up a tree and gets in a branch so as to get away from the dog and uh... meanwhile this cat was also startled this is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood the cat also got startled because of this dog and so it climbed up the tree now this little girl is riding her her tricycle and sees this cute little cat and so she's trying to coax it down from the tree uh... meanwhile another another fellow walker on the street saw uh... what the whole scene was going what was happening and how there's not only this cat stuck in the tree but also a man stuck in the tree uh... who's afraid to get down so the fire department gets called and the fire department comes with their ladders to rescue the man and the cat"}, {"filename": "NEURAL62-2_1104587_1341190.wav", "transcript": "All right, this starts with the stepmother and the two daughters. And there's a gentleman in the next picture with a little girl who is Cinderella, who is courteous and all pleasant, and they obviously aren't. I presume this is going to be her father, but he never shows up again. The sisters and mother treat Cinderella like she's a servant, and they're very unkind to her. And as a result, she makes friends with the animals. And down the road, the stepmother gets a letter inviting everyone to a ball at the castle because the prince's father, the king, thinks it's time for him to find a wife. And everyone is invited. And the girls are all very excited. And Cinderella thinks she's included. So she, there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk. And the only thing I can think that is is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instructions. So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom and makes, with the help of the mice, they make a dress. And she gets ready the night of the ball to go and is told that this was not for her. She's not allowed to go. And as I recall, they rip her dress to shreds and they go on to the ball. And she kind of goes back to her little lofty place. The next thing we see is we've got the mice and the animals around being empathetic. And then her fairy godmother appears. And the fairy godmother whips her up a beautiful white gown in a pumpkin carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, but something scared the horses. And that was before this. So anyway, the pumpkin carriage is all good. She gets in the carriage. The fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight before it all goes away. So she goes to the ball. The stepmother and sisters are adored to see her and not happy at all. And the prince is enchanted and they spend the evening dancing. And all of a sudden she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight. And she takes off running. And going down the stairs, she loses one of the glass slippers provided by the fairy godmother. And the prince finds it and she gets home. And she's sitting with the animals looking at the glass slipper with good memories. So now the prince still has a glass slipper. And he sends everyone out looking for the girl with the other glass slipper. And when they hear about this, the stepmother and the stepsisters, they realize it was her and they don't want him to know. So they lock her in her room. However, the little animals, the mice especially, bring a key to get her to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper. And that is what happens. She goes downstairs, tries on the glass slipper. The prince realizes he's found his bride. And that's about the end of the stepmother and stepsisters. And the last we see is they're getting married, living happily ever after. Beautifully. I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay, the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made with white bread. Totally unhealthy, but it's so good. So you need two pieces of white bread and a knife and a plate. And you make peanut butter. I didn't mention this before, but it's much better if it doesn't have sugar in it."}, {"filename": "NEURAL6-2_1782983_2019549.wav", "transcript": "Um and of course she was pretty upset by that. Uh the stepsisters were decked out in all their fancy regalia and the stepmother was beautifully dressed herself and they took the family's coach and left to go to the mall leaving Cinderella behind in the fire near the fireplace um crying. Well as she was crying something happened and she looked around and there was a very sweet older lady standing there and Cinderella of course is kind of surprised to see this. By the way I'm not clear at all where the father was during all this. He apparently traveled a lot and so he was gone. Um the uh so anyway the the uh woman introduced herself to Cinderella telling her that she was her fairy godmother and she was there to grant her wishes. Well Cinderella was taken aback quite quite thrilled at this whole possibility and so the fairy godmother said you will go to the ball and she I think the very first thing she did was to to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella and her beautiful hairdo and lovely uh tiara type thing to put in her hair and beautiful slippers to put on her feet which were very unusually made out of glass. But Cinderella said how can I get to the ball the carriage is gone I can't walk uh especially not in glass slippers and so the fairy godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin created uh a coachman and uh other servants out of the mice and I think made the rats into horses. So anyway there they were all set ready to go to the ball so she left Cinderella left in her all her finery and went to the ball walked in and the whole place came to a hush. Everybody's looking at her and thinking who is that beautiful young woman? And of course guess who was the most impressed was the prince. So he immediately asked her to dance and after they had one dance he was really not interested in anybody else. So they had a lovely time. Suddenly though Cinderella remembered the most important thing that the fairy godmother had told her which was at the stroke of midnight she had to leave the ball because if by the end of 12 bell strikes she was still there everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were Romans. So she uh she was remembering that and thinking oh I really have to be careful but she was so carried away by this lovely time that she was having with the prince and he was so falling so much in love with her that time went on really fast and all of a sudden bang she started to hear she heard the first stroke of midnight. So she ran she said I have to go ran out of the palace and uh the prince ran after her and the prince's uh fancy servant ran after her.

And she's probably, like, 14. Perfect. The end. Little Red Riding Hood. Oh, boy. Same deal. OK? OK. And while you're looking at the pictures, I am going to show you something. She's a vicious predator. Oh, boy, more small, furry creatures. Oh, a big, furry creature. Oh, what big eyes you have. Oh, boy. OK. All right. So that's Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood. So Little Red Riding Hood's this little brat who always wears a red hood, I think, because she thinks it looks cool. I did the same thing when I had, like, maybe sixth or seventh birthday, I don't remember. I got flippers and goggles and a snorkel, and I literally never took them off, even to sleep. And the worst blood crimes, it was bad. But anyway, I think Little Red Riding Hood's doing the same thing, and she's gotten a reputation for wearing it, so she's called Little Red Riding Hood. And one day, I mean, she lives with her mom. I don't know where the daddy's probably ran out on her. But probably because she wears that red hood all the time. I think that's the source of all her problems. So she lives with her mom, and one day, the woodcutter comes to her little cottage in the woods. Maybe the woodcutter's her dad. He's just stopping by every so often to keep tabs on her, but he doesn't actually want any fatherly responsibilities. But he comes up, and he says, hey, Snow White and, no, Snow White, oof, Red Riding Hood, and your mother. I was just out at your grandma's cottage, and she is kind of sick. Like, you should probably go see her before she dies. That's not true. He didn't say that. Maybe it was implied. Then again, why would you leave your grandmother in a cottage all on her own? That doesn't make sense. She's probably OK. She just has a cold. She's not terminally ill. Good. So that is what the woodcutter says. Says your grandma has caught a cold because she went dancing naked in the rain and then didn't take care of herself.

Cinderella was very beautiful, but the women and her daughters whom she served were ugly. Cinderella did things like serving tea and the women whom she served were not very appreciative. They were pretty snarky. She would sit by her window and from her room she had a direct view to the castle in the distance. And she often dreamed of a better life. She had a mystical way with animals and although she was lonely, she had friends who were the animals in the barn and also some mice and some birds, bluebirds specifically. One day a proclamation came and the prince was having a ball and the woman and her two daughters were invited and Cinderella got very excited and dreamed of the possibility of going, but of course she was not on the invitation list nor did she have the right clothes. So these magical mice got together and they showed Cinderella a special magic chest where wishes come true and she wished for a gown and a gown was made and a necklace so that actually she could go to the ball, but one of these young women ripped the necklace from her and she was very discouraged. She felt that she couldn't attend and the mice intervened again and brought her a wise old fairy godmother and the godmother said I will make you a beautiful gown and slippers and a pumpkin coach so that you can attend the ball, but there's only one stipulation that the spell will only last until the stroke of midnight. So you must be back before the stroke of midnight or the illusion will be broken. So she went to the ball and she danced with the prince and they had a wonderful time, but she looked up and noticed it was almost midnight so she quickly ran away, but in the process of exiting she left her her glass slipper behind. But she managed to make it home with one slipper just as the pumpkin coach was turning back into a pumpkin.

After she was over and worked, she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the two main sisters. There was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse. Cinderella was always mopping, mopping, cleaning, you know, cooking, doing all the things, scrubbing on the floor with her hands and knees. Cinderella received a delivery, it was sealed, and that delivery went to the stepmother. Stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read it out to the sisters and to Cinderella. Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited, but as it turned out, she was not, so the stepmother denied her that, and I would imagine stepmother and daughters were off to the ball, they were invited to a ball, the prince was having a ball. Cinderella was left back home, dreaming that she could go to the ball, in fact she tried on or looked at a dress that she would like to wear if she were going to the ball. She imagined the dress and then she looked at pictures of the dress. She was friends with all the small creatures. They decided to make a dress for her, so they sewed and they spun and they weaved and appliqued the bows on the dress. She didn't know this was happening, she glanced at the castle and probably heard the music. The birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special surprise for her. She was so delighted with the dress. Meanwhile, the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing off to the ball and Cinderella was left back, very forlorn and depressed with her dress and shreds, I believe that they may have been responsible. She cried, everybody was sad, her friends, the animals, the small creatures.

And they were not very pleasant step-sisters. And in the same kingdom, there was a prince who was unmarried. And the king thought the prince ought to get married and find a beautiful bride. So he decided to throw a big party, a ball, and sent out word throughout the kingdom that there would be this ball and a princess chosen for the prince. Well, the two ugly step-sisters, unpleasant step-sisters, decided they should go to the ball and bickered a little bit among themselves, but found clothes, and the stepmother dressed them and made sure that they looked properly, and they went off to the ball. The Cinderella, who was the younger one, wanted to go, too, but the stepmother said, no, no, it's not appropriate, and the sister said, no, she couldn't possibly be chosen. They shouldn't go in any case. In the meantime, Cinderella found some things in a trunk, I believe, in the attic or something, and her fairy godmother appeared and said, well, of course, she could go to the ball, and provided her with a beautiful dress, turned a pumpkin into a carriage, and some mice into horsemen or two horses, and Cinderella went off to the ball. At the ball, she was spotted by the prince, who wanted to dance with her, because he thought she was the most attractive girl there, and she did dance with the prince, but one of the things that the fairy godmother had told her was that she must be back by midnight, or the coach would turn back to a pumpkin and the horses to mice, and her fancy dress would go back to her normal clothes. So suddenly, just as the clock began to strike twelve, and she was dancing with the prince, she remembered that, ran quickly out the door, losing one of her slippers on the way, and by the time the prince got outside and looked around, there was no coach with horses."}, {"filename": "richardson17_643700_880110.wav", "transcript": "This is the proper way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Gotcha. You're hilarious. Okay, so now I would like for you to tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can. You can use any details you know about the story, as well as the pictures you just looked at. So, once upon a time, there was a princess and her name was Snow White. And her name was Snow White because her skin was as white as snow, her hair was as dark as like a raven's feathers or something like that, and her lips were as red as a rose. She was beautiful. I don't know how she has a stepmother, assuming she had parents, and then her mother died, and then her father died, and then he, er, sorry, mother died, father remarried, then father died, because he would hope that he would step in. So Snow White was reduced to doing chores, a lot like other princesses of fairy tales. And while she did this, she was contented with her dream prince, didn't get out of the castle very much, and there's this really famous scene where she's singing over a wishing well, and her voice is echoing back to her, so she says, I'm wishing, and then it echoes back, and she's basically saying that one day she'll get saved from this by a prince. So the stepmother was not very happy that Snow White was as beautiful as she was. Because she was used to being the fairest in all the land, and she has a mirror that when she asks, mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all, the mirror responds that she is the fairest of them all, usually in rhyme. That there are none as beautiful as she. And one day when the queen, who has very low self-esteem, asked the mirror who the fairest in the land was, the mirror responded that, it's a pretty fickle mirror, that Snow White was in fact the fairest of them all. So having not to be bested by Snow White's good looks, their stepmother orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and to kill her. Pretty messed up. You could have just maimed her. Right, like acid or something. So the hunter takes Snow White into the forest, and in the version that I know, Snow White figures out that she's in trouble and she runs away from the hunter when he tries to kill her, and that's how she gets away. And while she's running into the forest, she gets lost in the wood, and she comes upon a house in a clearing. She gets to the house and she realizes that everything is small and that it's filthy, so doing what she does best, chores, she gets right to work with her animal friends. I think she sings a song.

Went from there to Padua and Padua was St. Anthony who helps you find things. I'm a good Catholic boy, I can remember some of this stuff. But in Padua, it was, we got to see where he was born and where he was buried. That one really wasn't very exciting. Then we went from there to Assisi, which is St. Francis of Assisi, which a lot of people have heard of St. Francis, but we got to go to the cathedral basilica where he got a vision from God that said, rebuild my church. And he thought it was talking about this little church that was in Assisi. So he went to the little church and rebuilt it and then God said, nah, gave him more of a clarification and got him going. But we got to see where his little church was, which is now inside of a big basilica. We got to see where he was born. We got to see his basilica, which is huge. And it was interesting there. Interesting thing was they had been having earthquakes there so there were lots of, I'm not an artist, so lots of wall paintings that had big cracks in them and they were starting to do the repair work on it. And then the last part of that in Assisi, we went to where Francis was a monk and where his community was and they had a real neat thing. And in fact, we were a group of Americans and there was one guy from Ireland that came and talked to us and he could talk to us in English. None of the other guy, everybody else was Italian.

He was either from the attic or from high on the ladder leading up to the attic. Anyway, he fell and he sustained a severe head injury. Called 911, went to the hospital to, went to Methodist Hospital where he had emergency surgery that lasted three hours. They put his skull back together. And then the doctor said, I can fix the skull, but I can't fix the problem with the brain. He had unfortunately, fortunately, he hit the left side of his head and it took away his ability to speak. Also, it left him with paralysis on the right side of his body. And so Ted was in the hospital for, was in one hospital for a month and then he spent another hospital, another month at Community Rehab Hospital. And after that, three more months getting subacute therapy at Hamilton Trace. So that was a total of five months in which he had intensive and then subacute therapy, both physical therapy and speech therapy.

One of, oh, after we had the home physical therapy and then they said that was the end, then he had three more months of physical, outpatient physical therapy until that ended in November, September, October, and November. After that, we were able to get him signed up at NeuroHope for the physical therapy part. And are you familiar with NeuroHope? NeuroHope is an amazing place. It's, just very quickly, it was started by a man named Chris Lu. Chris Lu sustained a severe neck injury and became quadriplegic approximately eight years ago.

The evil stepmother has a nasty cat, and the nice stepdaughter has a goofy but friendly dog. Soon, the king tells his son, the prince, that he has to have a bride to be a princess, because that's the way it works in evil monarchies. And the king is so annoying that the prince will probably kick him out of the house, or he'll become king, and he'll just have a princess who will become queen. So the declaration is made throughout the land. Cinderella, the nice stepchild, finds a book in a chest in the attic, which has absolutely nothing to do with the story. But she also finds a dress that would be great to wear. She puts on the dress, and her evil stepsisters laugh at her, because she's not going to go to the ball, because she's nobody. I think I've missed a couple pages with odd-looking animals. But this is the main part of the story. Cinderella is sad. She can't go to the ball. But the fairy godmother appears. And the fairy godmother presents her with a carriage with goofy-looking horses. That's a pretty goofy-looking carriage, too. And helps her get dressed, and she goes to the ball. At the ball, the prince is dancing with all the eligible women at the ball. And eligibility includes being between 16 and 20 years old, being high class, and having the right creed, religion, race, and financial status. And he dances with Cinderella. She's wonderful. Somehow, she knows how to do these dances. And he likes dancing with her. But suddenly, she arises. It's almost midnight. And she has to go, or her weird-looking carriage will turn into a pumpkin. Pumpkins don't travel on old, unpaved roads very well at all. So she gets going. And pretty soon, it does happen. The carriage turns into a pumpkin. And the horses sit on their butts and won't go any further. But somehow, she does manage to make it home."}, {"filename": "NEURAL11-1_34938_271230.wav", "transcript": "So, luckily I haven't had any injuries or significant illnesses, but the first time I did have to go into the hospital was when I had my son, and at that time I had to have a cesarean section, so pretty common surgery. But I guess the scariest thing was they gave me the epidural, and afterwards being paralyzed from the waist down was quite an interesting feeling, I should say, and my son had to go into a special care nursery, so he wasn't in my room with me, and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the special care nursery so that I could nurse him, so that was a rather scary kind of feeling, and I guess because I've worked with people with stroke and other neurological disorders, it kind of gave me at least a little bit of an inkling of what they go through and how they feel, not being able to have some motor control. So luckily that only lasted for a few hours, and then it wore off, but that was actually the first time I ever had to go into the hospital, when I was in my 30s, giving birth to my son. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating before? Yes. Tell me what the problems were and a little bit about what you did about it. Okay, well I am the Associate Director of the Aphasia Lab at the University of South Carolina, so I work with people with aphasia every day and have been a speech pathologist for over 30 years, so I guess you could say I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last 30 years of my working life, and what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people who are cognitively intact, but yet are not able to express themselves. So I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So I've just always been really interested in ways to improve, and of course for the last four years is when I've been at the Aphasia Lab, so we've focused on aphasia and being able to, number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication, but also I teach the Adult Language Disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well, and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication, supported conversation with family members, and just trying to improve in general people's ability to communicate no matter what their verbal communication is like, and no matter what their cognitive skills are either. I have done research both with people with stroke, but also with brain injuries, so I've worked with people with lots of different levels of cognitive and language disorders, so just, I guess, maximizing as much as we can ways for people to express themselves. Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life. It could be happy, it could be sad, it could be from when you were a child, it could be from more recently. I guess it could be, so I have two children, and one of my children is adopted and one is not, so I already told the story about my son being born, so I guess we can talk about my daughter and the adoption. We tried to have children for many years and couldn't get pregnant, and we went through lots of fertility treatments, and they didn't really find anything that would cause us not to get pregnant, but I was bound and determined to be a mom."}, {"filename": "NEURAL17-1_847072_1083340.wav", "transcript": "So I know the gist of it, but not every detail. So Cinderella has two stepsisters. And I'm not sure if her father is a prince or a prominent person, but the stepsisters get favored all the time by the stepmother. And Cinderella, in effect, has to serve them, wait on them, clean the house, do all the heavy lifting while the two sisters don't have to do anything. And then they get invited to a ball, a dancing ball, and they're all excited. And it looks like Cinderella had a dress to wear and was planning on going to the ball, but it looks like they took the ribbon off of her dress, which I don't remember. I thought she didn't have anything that she wasn't expected to go. But from the book, it looked like she had found something to wear. But anyway, so the stepsisters went without her, thinking Cinderella was not going to go. And then a fairy godmother came and helped Cinderella with a beautiful dress and a fantastic carriage that she turned into from a pumpkin and mice that turned into horses. And she goes in this grand style to the ball. And of course, the prince likes her the best and dances with her the most. And then she's got to leave suddenly at noon, midnight, because her fairy godmother said, you can have all this, but it's only good until midnight. And then be home by then, because everything is going to go away. The horses turn back into mice, the carriage turns into a pumpkin, and you are going to have your regular clothes on. So she leaves at midnight, and the prince is heartbroken. And in the course of her running away to make it by midnight, she drops one of her glass slippers, and the prince gets it. And so then the prince has his men search high and low for every woman who can try this glass slipper on. And that's how he finds her. So it only fits her foot. So she tries it on, and then the prince has identified her and they get married and they live happily ever after. For your first task, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And you may begin. Okay, first you go into the kitchen and you find the bread. And you untwist a little twisty of the bread and you pull out two pieces of bread. I'm assuming you're making one sandwich. And you find the peanut butter, you untwist the lid.

They packed the truck with all their toys, and they gathered all the rats. They climbed. Some climbed in the front of the cab. Some of the younger rats climbed in the back. Off they went down the road up a great big hill. Flowers and bushes. It was a very bumpy road with lots of rocks. When they hit one particularly large rock, a little girl rat with her stuffed animal flew right out of the back of the truck. The truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic, not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls. She lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance. The rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic, and they all climbed out of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys. Some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water. Some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers. It was a beautiful lake, and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time. Grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her, and mother and father rat watched their children play. Everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen out of the truck. She sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal to her and crying. She was so scared and lonely. The woods seemed so big and scary, and she looked every which way and didn't know what to do. The flowers were pretty, and she looked at the red flowers around her and the yellow flowers. Meanwhile, back at the lake, father called all the little rats to come and help them. He called all the little rats to come and have lunch. Back in the woods, the little rat, the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal, was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her. She found that they were very, very yummy, juicy red raspberries. Meanwhile, back at the lake, the family started to realize that something was wrong. They were missing the little girl rat. The children sat and waited while the parents searched and called, but she was nowhere to be seen. They looked in the water and along the edges. They looked under rocks and in the grass. They were sad. Some of the young rats were even crying.

It's a 2001 and it's in perfect condition. I still ride it some of the time. Now I'd like you to tell me about a time that you've had, an experience you've had with someone who has had a difficult time communicating. Oh, yes, I remember this from last time because the only examples I could really think of were my mother and mother-in-law and father-in-law because they both had health problems which affected their ability to communicate. The one I really didn't talk about was my mother for the last two or three years that she was alive was getting dementia, mild dementia, certainly not Alzheimer's, but her short-term memory was really starting to go. So I'd call her on the phone about once a month or sometimes more if there was anniversaries and birthdays and things like that or if we were planning to come to Philadelphia. And this started while she was still living at the house I grew up in, Elkins Park, northside of Philadelphia area. And I would talk to her on the phone and say, me and Jean are coming in May. We're going to New Jersey and then we'll be in Philadelphia. And, oh, you know, how long are you going to be here? Visiting my brother and we'll visit you for a few days and then we might go see my cousin. Oh, that's nice. When are you coming? Well, like around Memorial Day and the week after Memorial Day. How long are you going to be here? Oh, you're going to visit anybody else? I'm going to go see my brother and see my cousin. And we would just do this exact same conversation, you know, a couple, two or three times. And then we'd talk about Jean's doing belly dance and I'm like, oh, I didn't know that. And I'm like, how often does she do it? And then we'd talk about that, talk about the house and she'd say, well, when am I going to ever see you again? When are you going to come visit? And I'm like, ah, in about two weeks, Memorial Day. And it would be really frustrating. But after I got kind of used to it, I just tried not to lose my patience and just tell the story again, third time or fourth time. And it was just really short term because she'd remember other things. Going back to the 1920s, when she was born, she had a very good memory for a lot of things, especially for people in the family that were unpleasant to her 50 years ago, she remembered. But she remembers vacations and different places."}, {"filename": "capilouto13a_307578_543431.wav", "transcript": "Oh, well, I had to, of course, drink plenty of fluids, be sure to take my medicine, too, when I came home.

I suppose right now, I don't usually have a difficult time communicating, but I do at this particular time have a difficult time communicating with the manager of the townhouse complex where I live. And I think it's because when I make suggestions to improve conditions there, she perceives it as me being critical. And like if I say, well, can we trim this tree or can this tree be trimmed or something like that, then she takes that as being critical. So I find her, I find communicating with her is a challenge, and at this point, I'm just about to the point where I don't even want to communicate with her because it's not worth my time or effort. And besides that, it doesn't really make all that much difference anyway. So that's probably my most, you know, I would say\u2014oh, there's been times in the past with students who they don't understand what you have said, but you just have to go over it again with them. But I find that's just a normal part of teaching. Well, at my age, of course, there are sad\u2014one has experienced sad events, death of loved ones, etc., but I guess I would choose to focus on the things that are the most positive. And that would have to be, of course, the birth of my three children. Those were very positive events. Think back on that. You were very, very happy that they were born and they were healthy and, you know, very grateful. I wanted boys all three times. I got boys all three times, although now I could see the advantage of having a daughter, but I do have a daughter-in-law, so that's, you know, that's not a problem. The other very happy times in my life have been the times where I've traveled and met people. I've been all over the world, and I do a lot of mission work. So, you know, communicating with those folks and being able to share something with them and to see\u2014go back and see the progress they have made, and that's a very gratifying, you know, position to be in. The story of a little boy playing ball, or kickball, I guess, or he's kicking a ball, and he kicks it through a window, breaks a window.

And then the stepmother had beautiful dresses made for her two daughters, but not Cinderella. And Cinderella, with the help of her forest friends or her animal friends and a fairy godmother made a beautiful dress. Well, I guess the fairy godmother didn't help that yet. Well, Cinderella made a dress and then she was planning to go. And the stepmother said, no, you're not going anywhere. You're going to stay home and clean the house. We're going to the ball. And Cinderella was sad. Then she had her dress kind of tore up and by the stepmothers, by the stepsisters. And then everyone left for the ball except for Cinderella.

So using the forest animals, they created everything she needed, a beautiful gown. They turned the pumpkin into a coach. They changed the mice into horses and everybody participated. But the thing is they told her she had to be home by midnight when the clock struck midnight because the magic would wear off. So Cinderella went to the ball and she came in and everybody was, since it was a kind of a masquerade kind of ball too, not everybody knew who everybody was, depends on which version you watch. So she went in and everyone danced with the prince and the prince fell in love with Cinderella and wanted to dance the night away with her. But she noticed it was getting close to midnight. So she was leaving the ball and he was chasing her. And then when she was going, when she was on the steps, she had lost one of her glass slippers, which miraculously didn't change back into what it was prior and she got to the cart just as the, she got to the carriage just as it was striking midnight.

Now, the fairy godmother had told her, you can be at the ball until midnight, but at the stroke of 12, you will again become Cinderella in your tattered clothes, and the coach will once again become a pumpkin, and everything will go back to how it was. So Cinderella knew that, and she had forgotten, but now the clock started to tick, bong, bong. She said, oh, to the prince, I'm so sorry, but I must go. No, said the prince, don't leave. Yes, I have to go. Why? I can't tell you. And off she dashed down out of the ballroom, down the steps, and as she did, she fell and the slipper came off of her. One of the glass slippers came off of her feet and landed on the stairs, but she kept running, and now she got into the coach, she got into the coach and off they went, and then poof, she was back home, but she was herself again, and the coach was a pumpkin, and all she had left was one glass slipper, but the other glass slipper remained on the stairs of the ballroom. This was found by the prince and his courtier, the people who served him, and the prince said, well, I have this slipper anyway. I will now, we will now go throughout the kingdom and we will see to whom does, on whose foot does the slipper fit? And so they went to the house of Cinderella and her family, but Cinderella was locked in the room upstairs so that there was no possible chance that she could come to have the slipper tried on her foot, and then the evil stepsisters tried to fit their big feet into the slipper, but of course it would not go. Is there not someone else in this household? And now the little mice once again had, with their key, had opened the door and down came Cinderella. I would like to try it on, she said. Not only that, she had in her hand the other glass slipper, and so now they had found the woman who had, beautiful young woman who had been at the ball, and she was quickly taken to the palace, and the handsome prince was so happy to see her, and he said, will you marry me?

But at one point her mother passed away. Her father went on a business trip where he was hit in the face with a satchel and passed away as well. So coming back he was supposed to bring her a small present and that didn't happen. But he did bring back this wonderful stepmother and her two stepdaughters Brunhilde and Giselda. I think that's their names. I should have looked it up. So these two girls were incredibly spoiled brats but Cinderella, Giselle being the kind person that she was, wanted to make them feel happy at home and loved. She took care of them until her father passed away unexpectedly. She still took care of the family because her stepmother was the only mother that she ever knew. As time went on there was to be a ball. The ball was to celebrate the prince and his engagement to the princess. He had picked the princess. She was going to be decided at the ball. So when the ball came up the stepdaughters were totally evil and destroyed the dress that Giselle, Cinderella, had made. Her dress was then taken care by her fairy godmother. Her fairy godmother also turned the pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into footsmen, the lizards into chairmen and they were able to go to the ball. But she had to be home by midnight. It got too close to time and she was a slacker. She wasn't getting herself ready. A couple minutes beforehand she realized her ineptitude and started running down the stairs. She took to flight and losing a shoe in the process. She made it most of the way home but most of the spells had disintegrated as she landed at her house. However the glass slipper still survived and the prince had his and she had hers. So when the prince decided to go and find his princess he drove around town on his carriages or his horse made all of the eligible ladies try it on but he got to her sister's house. Oldest sister couldn't fit so she cut off her heel. That didn't work. The birds plucked her eyes out. Younger sister cut off her toe. That didn't work. The birds plucked her eyes out. Then she got to Cinderella. Giselle finally got to try on the shoe. It fit. She did offer a forgiveness for those other two sisters that rather than wandering through the woods blind and sullied in their foot they would just have to wander the woods and know where to give them grace."}, {"filename": "NEURAL6-1_1084873_1320536.wav", "transcript": "Okay, once there was a gentleman, and he lived with his wife, and they had a lovely little girl, but unfortunately, the wife died.

He brought her to his home, and he introduced her to his daughter, and the three daughters and the mother were very, very richly dressed, and really, at that time, so was his daughter. As time went on, and he married this woman, and they were all living together, it became apparent that the mother, who, of course, was the stepmother of Cinderella, was favoring her daughters quite a bit more than she was the man's daughter. In fact, the man's daughter had to do so much work, and ended up spending her nights by the fireplace instead of in bed, so she was covered with ashes from the fireplace, and so they started to mock her in calling her Cinderella. The stepsisters were unkind, mean, nasty, and basically made Cinderella's life very unpleasant. In the kingdom where this family lived was a king who had a son who was a very handsome prince. A very handsome prince. The son was not yet married, and hadn't really found anybody that he was interested in marrying, and so the king decided to have a ball to introduce his son to all the ladies in the land so that he could find someone to marry, because the king was very anxious for his son to be married. So they sent out invitations to everyone in the whole kingdom. The invitation came to the house of our hero family, and they received the invitation, and everybody is ecstatic, and the stepdaughters go around, no, sorry, the stepsisters go around and try to find all the most beautiful things to wear, and Cinderella, of course, is really wanting to go to the ball, too, but the stepsisters mock her and tell her that there's no place for someone like her at the ball, she will have to stay home while they wear all their beautiful clothes and go out to the ball. She's not happy about this, and she spends some time talking to her animal friends about how sad she is and how much she wishes she could go to the ball. So the evening of the ball comes, and the stepmother and the stepsisters, I honestly don't know if the father went to the ball or not. He may have, but anyway, probably did. So they all left to go to the ball, and Cinderella is just feeling desperately sad and feeling so bad about not being able to go, and all of a sudden, she realizes there's somebody in the room with her there, and she's, who is this person, who are you? And the woman says, I am the fairy godmother, and I'm going to help you go to the ball.

That's in panel two. It just so happens to be a gentleman who's sitting in a chair by the very window that the ball comes crashing through. The ball hits a lamp, knocks the lamp over toward the gentleman. He's clearly very surprised that this is happening. That's the end of panel three. In panel four, he picks up the soccer ball and is looking out the window, clearly unhappy about what's happened. In this story, there's a small boy, he's getting ready to go to school. His mom knows that there's a prediction for rain that day, so she's encouraging him to take an umbrella along with him. But he says no, he really doesn't need to have an umbrella today, he doesn't want to take it. On panel two, he says bye to his mother, big smile on his face, he's ready to go to school and start walking. Mom is still a little concerned that she's going to get rained on, but she holds the umbrella in her back. In panel three, he's walking off to school. He gets partway there and it starts to rain. The rain starts falling down. As shown in panel four, the rain is coming down heavier now. Puddles are accumulating and the little boy realizes he's going to get absolutely soaked by the time he gets to school, unless he turns around and goes home. So he does that. In panel five, he gets into the door. Mom is there, she's a little disappointed, a little concerned, possibly a little frustrated with him, but she is very patient. The boy is clearly unhappy himself. He must get changed up just a little bit, put some warm and dry clothing on, and then leaves the house. He's walking back to school, this time with an umbrella. Well, this picture shows a rescue personnel, a gentleman who has a red or orange vest on with some kind of belts which must be used to fasten him on to a line, to a wire that's a rope that's holding him onto the shore. He's coming out into a really torrent of a river, which probably occurred because of some flooding upstream, causing a flash flood. There's a young woman who's grasping onto a branch, and presumably she got washed down the stream, got caught up somehow. The rescue gentleman who's coming in to rescue her then is pulling himself down the limb to where the young woman is, and at this point it looks like he'll be able to get to her safely and have his colleagues on the shore to pull them both to safety. Okay, in this story, it begins with Cinderella as a little girl. She's in the home of her father. She has a puppy dog who's her friend.

And I spent three days waiting for the antibiotic to work, each day getting worse. And my fever went, kept going up, and I started puking. And I felt very close to death. Anyway, so I called my friend who gave me a different prescription. I don't know why I didn't go to the hospital, but I didn't, I couldn't move. Anyway, so he brought over a new medication, and it was the right one. And so I got better. And once you hit the right medication with the UTI, you just get better. You don't really do anything. You just keep resting, drinking a lot of water. And it was a very stressful time in my life. That was part of why it triggered the UTI. But anyway, so yeah, I got the right antibiotic, and recovered probably within four days, was back to normal. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. So if you could choose an instance, and tell me what problems there were, and what you did to communicate, and did about the problems. Okay.

Either did not know the words, or he did not know himself. It was hard to say. It's hard to say. There would be extremely long, long, long pauses. And then there would be inappropriate responses. Or there'd be an inappropriate response, or it would be a complete diversion. So that whatever it was that was asked, was not going to be answered.

Okay. So in 1984, I applied and received a scholarship to do my master's degree at DePaul University in Greencastle, Indiana. And during the first week of having arrived, even before classes started, we were just orientation, et cetera, et cetera. I found out that the Pan Am Games were going to come to Indianapolis in 1987. So I immediately applied for a job with the Pan Am Games that took the whole duration of my master's degree to materialize. But eventually in 86, I was appointed vice president of international relations with the Pan Am Games. And as such, I traveled extensively with the president of the Pan Am Games organizing committee, including a trip to Cuba to meet with Fidel Castro and convince him or rather offer conditions that would satisfy him for Cuba to participate in the Pan Am Games in Indianapolis of 87. That's the 10th Pan American Games. So essentially we offered that the athletes would not have to receive a visa. Anybody who got on the plane came to the games. That the plane would fly directly from Havana to Indianapolis. That they would get a preferential area of the Pan American village to house their athletes. And finally, that the United States would lend every support it could to the organization of the 1991 games in Havana. So those were the four conditions that the Cubans requested. We said yes to everything. Of course, last one was whatever is in our power to do because we are not the Pan American sports organization who is ultimately the one that decides where the next games are going to be played. And so Cuba agreed to participate. And I was the one person that got the call from the Olympic committee in Cuba, from the Cuban Olympic committee, confirming that they were going to participate. That was very thrilling because for a few minutes I was the only one that knew that Cuba was going to participate in the Pan Am games, which was a very sought after objective. It was whatever everybody wanted. And I was the only person in the organization that knew about it because I was acting as interpreter between the Cubans and the organizing committee in India. So that was a real thrill. And the Cubans participated and the Pan Am games went to Cuba in 1991. I was not a part of that. But then in 95, I met the Cubans again because they came as consultants to my participation in the Pan American games in Argentina."}, {"filename": "wright10a_1228073_1463543.wav", "transcript": "And so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water.

Amazingly, Carl knew how to turn on the stereo and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music. And Carl danced and danced for the baby. And the baby laughed and clapped his hands. Afterwards, Carl and the baby were both very hungry. So they wandered into the kitchen. They got into the refrigerator. What did they find? Bread and butter. Carl got a package of whole wheat bread and he ripped it open and ate all the bread. Meanwhile, the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty buttery taste. They found grapes and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth. They made chocolate milk with syrup. What a mess. You can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor. And what's in the red jar? Oh my, there was food everywhere and the baby was a mess. The baby climbed onto Carl's back and they climbed back up the stairs, leaving the mess behind. Carl, smart dog that he was, started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside. He got a washcloth, a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap and he scrubbed the baby. Carl's mouth was full of soap and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh.

The person that I had the most contact with like this, that was my mother. And she started to have memory issues back in 1995 where she would repeat her, what she had just said and without any awareness that she was repeating herself. And of course, at first that's, you don't really know how to deal with that. And I had a, I'm not sure, honestly, I don't, I'm not sure that I did this, but I think that I would say, yeah, mom, we decided on that, you know, a little while ago. And so we're gonna do this. And so I would tell her what we had decided when she brought it up first time. So that gradually got worse. It was diagnosed by her doctor as vascular dementia. So she was having little tiny strokes that were knocking out connections in her brain. And the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright, real intelligent. And she would tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something. She would read in the paper that somebody had died and then talk about it and then later do the same thing. And then she would say, oh, I must have not read the paper before. And I didn't, and so I didn't know it. She would make up reasons, logical, logical reasons why she hadn't known something. She also got really good at asking questions instead of asking, you know, making, making, asking other people to talk instead of having them ask her questions because she knew she wasn't able to answer questions. So I think, I'm not sure, but I think that this was some reading that I had done, which said that with a person with that sort of memory loss, there is absolutely no point in trying to help them to remember or make them, or for heaven's sake, make them feel bad about not remembering things. Because of course, there's a period of time in there when you realize, when my mother was realizing that she was losing memory. And it was horrible for her. She felt awful. And of course, after a while, it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore. And that's really better. At least it didn't hurt her so much. And I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what experience means. Experiencing things means when you can't remember them. Like we would go to plays and musicals and concerts. And this was when she was living with my aunt and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies really, but musical things, concerts and musical theater. Mom would have no memory whatsoever of that the next day. But she loved it while it was happening. Just was delighted. She was always musical and this kind of stuff just pleased her no end. And so I had, it was really interesting to think about what she, what it means, what that means. Is it valuable? How valuable is it when you don't remember it?

I heard it crack, and it made a snapping sound, and I knew that was not a good thing to hear, so I went down on the ground, sat down immediately, and got off my foot. I don't remember where Heidi went. The dog's name was Heidi, and she was there, but I got up the stairs because the yard stairs went into the backyard going down the stairs.

I don't have to go to the hospital. He said, oh, yes, you do. He must have been in about fifth grade. You have to go to the hospital. I said, no, I don't.

When it's time to leave for the ball, Cinderella appears to a stepmother with her stepsisters dressed in this beautiful ball dress and ready to go. They are very angry that she would have to confront her and actually think that she could go to the ball, being just a poor waitstaff at this point in her life. And so they destroy her dress and tear up the jewelry that was prepared for her and leave her crying and go off to the ball. At that point, Cinderella has a fairy godmother, and that's where the fairy godmother enters into the story. She talks with Cinderella, and Cinderella says, of course, that she does want to go to the ball, but she has no way of getting there and no clothing suitable. And so the fairy godmother creates a beautiful white ball dress for Cinderella."}, {"filename": "capilouto07a_202218_437565.wav", "transcript": "Okay, um, we were on a ferry going to Ellis Island a number of years ago to visit it shortly after it had been opened to the public. On this ferry were some French people. So I guess you could say they were having a difficult time communicating since most everybody spoke English, but they spoke French. And they were clearly having a tough time. So I went over, since I was quite fluent in French when I was much younger, I went and asked if I could help them in French. And the woman said, I don't remember the course of the conversation, but she did get to a point where I really could not understand what she was saying. And so I said to her in French that I was sorry, it had been a long time since I'd studied and spoken French, and I was sorry but my French wasn't very good. And she said to me, no it's not. And that was the end of the conversation. Well I'm going to tell you about having a grandson, because that's probably the most important thing that's happened in recent years. We waited very long. My mother has a cousin, I should go back and say my mother has a cousin who at the age of 70 had her first and only grandchild. And this happened about 15 years ago, and I remember saying to my husband at the time, can you imagine being 70 years old and not having a grandson? Well my first son got married, and after a year or two they told us they weren't planning to have any children. Then my second son got married, and we waited and we waited and we waited, and I had kind of given up hope when they called one night and said, we're both on the phone mom, put dad on the phone. Well the last time one of my sons had asked to put dad on the phone was to tell us that he was getting divorced. So I wasn't so happy about that. So dad got on the phone, and now my son said, now there are five of us on the phone. I said, how five? Well he said, Stephanie, me, you and dad and a baby, and it still didn't penetrate, I said what baby? Because I had pretty much given up hope. So they told us they were having a baby. We were extremely excited, and the baby was born seven months later, and we are of course thrilled with him. Boy is outside the house practicing with a soccer ball, practicing his kicks I guess, and he gets a really good kick going because he knocks it right through the window of the house, smashes the glass. Man is sitting inside the house, the ball comes in the window, knocks over a lamp, and then the man stands there and looks out the window looking kind of surprised. I can't quite figure out if that's a dust buster he's holding in his other hand, or getting ready to clean up the mess, I can't really tell. Little boy is getting ready to go to school. Mom hands him an umbrella, says, you're going to need this, it's going to rain. They go to the front door, he says, look it's not raining, I don't need the umbrella, leaves the house without the umbrella. Gets not too far from the house, and lo and behold it starts raining, and he starts getting wet. It starts raining more heavily, he runs back home, mom looks a little ticked off at him, he's wet, he's looking a little dismayed, but now he's on his way back to school with the umbrella. Well it appears to me that these people were in some kind of a boat on a body of water because the man is wearing a vest, a life vest, the girl however does not appear to be. Apparently there were some rapids or something, and for some reason they were thrown out of the boat. Boat overturned, don't know, they're thrown out of the water, they're now being swept down this waterway. The man grabs onto a branch that's hanging over the water, and the girl comes by and he tries to get her to hang on also so that she doesn't get swept any further away."}, {"filename": "wright84a_1470_236776.wav", "transcript": "First I get the bread, peanut butter, butter, jelly out on the counter, get the knife, and I open the package, take out my bread, butter the bread, put peanut butter on, jelly on, put a top on, put it on a plate, and slice the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in half, and we're ready to eat.

This is a Cinderella story, not Walt Disney's, that's for sure. Cinderella was a good girl, but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh-awful stepsisters. They were pampered, spoiled, and they were nasty. Cinderella was called Cinderella because her real name was Ella, and she was forced to deal with cinders, meaning she had to clean up the fireplace. She had to take out the cinders and do things like that, so it was pretty dirty. So happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party, a ball, a very happy one. The two stepsisters, helped by the horrible stepmother, got invitations to go. Poor Cinderella thought she had to stay home, but because she had always been a good girl, a fairy godmother appeared out of nowhere and said to her, look, you deserve to go. We can arrange this, but there are conditions. First of all, there will be a coach for you, pulled by horses. There will be a beautiful gown for you to wear, and lovely glass slippers. The biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at the ball, at the strike of twelve, you must be out of there, because at that time, your coach will turn into a pumpkin. Cinderella went to the ball. The prince could not take his eyes off her, because she was so good and so beautiful. She had a wonderful time, but all of a sudden, she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve. She knew she had to get the heck out of there really fast. In so doing, she dropped one of her slippers, but it didn't make any difference. She got out, she got back to the coach, and somehow or another managed to make her way home. Well, the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away, but that didn't matter because"}, {"filename": "richardson60_256257_491545.wav", "transcript": "And she's brought into a house with a stepmom and two stepsisters.

And they tell her that she can't go to the ball with them. And her sisters go off to the ball. And then Cinderella has a fairy godmother that gives her a beautiful dress and sends her off to the ball with glass slippers. And she gets there and she dances with the prince. And they fall in love, but the clock strikes midnight. And she loses a slipper and she has to run home because the magic is wearing off. And then the prince comes and finds her by bringing the glass slipper around to try to see whose foot it will fit. And then they fall in love once he finds it's her. Now we're going to do the same thing with the story of Snow White. So you can take your time and look at the pictures. And then I'm going to take the book away and ask you to tell it in your own words. If you want help turning pages, we can. Since your wrist is broken. Okay. Okay. It's been so long since I've seen all these movies and read the books. Okay, so tell me as much of the story as you can. You can use the pictures you saw in that book or anything you know beforehand. Okay, so there's a young woman named Snow White. And she works for an evil queen, has her doing all kinds of chores.

And her father, she loved very much and then he passed away and left her behind to be cared for by the stepmother and her two daughters. And they, she showed a lot of favoritism towards her own daughters and used Cinderella more as a servant or housemaid than an actual stepchild. And Cinderella was made to sleep in quarters that were cold and damp and while everybody else enjoyed the lavishness of the estate. And she had to do a lot of the menial work and be at everybody's beck and call. And really suffered a lot in that state and looked out her window frequently and saw the king's castle up on the hill and wondered what life would be like in different circumstances. And then at the same time, the king was very upset because his son, the prince, had not yet married and was coming to an age where he needed to be married to provide heirs for the kingdom. And so the king made a decree that there was gonna be a ball and that all the young maidens of the kingdom were to be invited and that the son would have to select from those that attended someone to be his bride and to carry on the royal tradition. So invitations were sent out and the stepmother received an invitation and was excited for her two daughters to go and attend the ball, but concluded that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend the ball, that she wouldn't be eligible and she would be left behind. So Cinderella was extremely disappointed and upset by this and was locked away so that she couldn't attend while the others went. But in her distress, her fairy godmother showed up and granted her the opportunity to have a gorgeous gown and shoes and carriage and horse, which she took all of the animals, the mice and the cats and what have you that were favorites of Cinderella and converted those into a fancy carriage and horses with a carriage master and so forth that took Cinderella to the ball. And so she had the opportunity to go, but the only condition was that she had to be back home by midnight because everything would go back to normal and the whole facade would be revealed after midnight. So she went, she had a great time. She got the opportunity to meet the prince. They enjoyed some time together and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company during the course of the ball. Of course, the stepmother wanted her daughters to have that opportunity and was rather jealous over this girl that she didn't recognize as Cinderella at the time, but tried to force her way into having the prince recognize her daughters and everything. And so then when midnight rolled around, Cinderella had been having such a good time that she let the time get away from her. At the very last second, she had to race from the castle to get in her carriage and make it home and just barely made it."}, {"filename": "NEURAL18-1_298140_533423.wav", "transcript": "So I had my screening after all of my treatments and I'm still in remission and it's 2020. So at least it's been that many years. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. So that's great. Yay. Because now what I'd like for you to do is to tell me what the difficulties were and what you did about it in that situation. So I'm gonna mute myself. Okay. Well, I'm not, I'll just say a person or this person or. The difficulty in trying to communicate with this person is that this person lives very much within his own head and his own thinking and has a difficult time conveying that in words. And many times it turns into emotion or feeling and which can be anger, frustration, any of those sorts of things. But that person has the understanding of why he feels angry or frustrated. But on the outside, we have no idea because those words never came out. And so what I try to do is ask questions and see what kind of answers I can get to put together what the problem is because it's much easier in my opinion to deal with those sorts of things as they come up rather than waiting until someone is like a powder keg and just blows up. However, asking questions can also be a problem with someone who doesn't communicate because then their problem is why are you asking all these questions? And then it's sort of like, then you back off and you give the time to calm down. But then you have to keep continuing to ask questions because say in this situation, it's a work environment and I need answers and I need clear communication. So another thing that I have tried to do is I see one individual in our office who can communicate with this person. And so I take notes on how that person works with me with the other person. And I also use that person occasionally to help me understand and get information as well. I won't say that it's successful all the time, but it is successful enough for me to get by. So asking questions, backing off as needed, feeling out the situation and finding an individual who can interact with that person to give me tips or insight into how to manage. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? And I understand what you already talked about might also fit this, but if you could choose something different to talk about in this case, that would be great. And it can be happy or sad. It can be from any point in your life, from child to now. So do you need a few moments to think about what you, oh, you know, okay. And then I will mute myself and you may please tell me your story.

Her mother had died and her father married a new wife who had two children of her own. They came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father. Her new stepmother and the stepmother's two daughters, Cinderella's stepsisters now, didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful and they were mean to Cinderella. The mother, the stepmother decided that Cinderella would be the maid, would be like a maid and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work. She made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning and she had to serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters. One day, an invitation came. The prince was having a ball and all the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball. The stepmother and the stepsisters were so excited and they started planning right away for the ball. Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of very long, difficult, dirty jobs knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in order to go to the ball. Cinderella was so sad. She went in her room and cried and her animal friends gathered around her. She was friends with all the animals because she was so nice and the animals loved her. The animals helped her do her chores and they all worked very hard and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball. When it was time to go to the ball, she went downstairs and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked and the beautiful dress, they just went crazy with rage and they tore the dress off of her and the pins out of her hair and they pushed her down and told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball. Crying, she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her and then Fairy Godmother appeared and took pity on Cinderella. With a wave of her wand, the Fairy Godmother produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen and Cinderella looked beautiful. The stepmother, or the Fairy Godmother, said that Cinderella was to go to the ball but she had to be back home by midnight because at midnight, her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal. So she took some mice and with a wave of her wand, she turned them into horses and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage and Cinderella climbed in her beautiful gown and went to the ball.

Um, see, other than, uh, being, having babies, uh, and, um, don't have any kidney, I did have, um, numerous colds and ear infections when I was young. So about five, when I was about five years old, it was determined that they were going to take my tonsils out. So they kind of told me what was going to be about and that I would have a scratchy throat. I can't remember everything because I was five years old. Um, but I do remember waking up and my mom was there and she was so comforting to me, very, um, difficult to swallow. So my throat was swollen and it hurt. And this is a lot for a five-year-old. And my parents brought my, um, Ken and Barbie doll, a little doll house. I can play with that while I was in the hospital bed. I remember them bringing me lime sherbet and it was so good on my throat. Um, I believe I was in the hospital about two days and the recovery was, was fairly easy. It took me a while, maybe about four or five days before I could actually eat something that was truly solid, but that really did help with the colds because I didn't hardly have any colds at all. So there you go. Easy peasy. Before we, I give you the actual prompt. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Can we keep that pretty broad? Any difficulty communicating? Okay. Um, so then what I'd like is if you could tell me what the issues or problems are or were, as well as what you do about those issues. Okay. Well, um, let's see. It was probably about six years ago. My best friend, her name is Sonny. We used to work together. Um, and her husband, Steven, tall guy, nice looking man. Um, he started doing weird things. Like, um, he left his glasses up in a tree and then he was forgetting things. And then, um, it actually got worse and worse. So about two years ago, she took him, Steven, to the doctor. They ended up doing an Alzheimer's test on him. And sure enough, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and watching Steven go downhill. Um, it's been so sad to this day. He's still going downhill and he's only 59 years old. Um, when I do see him, he now talks in two words, sentences, maybe three, or you'll ask him a question and he just kind of looks at you. And sometimes you have to do your hands or kind of visualize something for him for him to understand. Um, I think he's on medicine, but it doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often, I haven't been there since the virus, but, um, I kind of just hug him and I just look in his eyes and just tell him, hi, Steven, it's so good to see you. And he'll say, good to see you too. He doesn't remember my name. He remembers Sonny's name, but he knows that he knows me. But, um, as far as what I would do to help him talk, I, there's not a whole lot I can do because his conversation skills are, are gone. They're just gone. But, um, keeping it really simple for him, maybe ask a question, uh, that's maybe real easy for him to answer that doesn't involve memory. Like how are you feeling today? Or, you know, I like your pants, Steven, something like that. So that's, that's about all I know that I could do to help him is just keep it really simple."}, {"filename": "NEURAL28-2_109377_344583.wav", "transcript": "Um, it was, it wasn't only like a week really, that it was like, they wanted me to stay down.

Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? Um, and this can be any kind of difficulty communicating. Um, we keep it kind of broad. But what I was hoping is that you could tell me what kinds of difficulties there were, what kinds of issues and also what you did about it. Um, I guess just learning as my mom gets older that her hearing is not as good. And I obviously have a little bit of an issue speaking up. Um, and I forget that she can't hear me. Um, and we've tried different, you know, my brother's tried like different hearing aids for her to see if that helps. And, you know, you know, buying the headless speakers and so on and stuff like that. It really doesn't help. So now I'm just really practicing trying to look at her when I talk, which has become a challenge when, if you have a face mask on, um, but looking at her and remembering that she can't hear me. Cause I don't always think about it because I've known my, you know, my mom's never been hard of hearing. And now she has hard time hearing. I just have to remember to speak up. And often I don't remember that until I see her looking at me going, what are you saying? So we're working on that one still. I would like you to tell me, um, thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Um, something that happened to you could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to now, just any important event that you could tell me a story about. The day my granddaughter was born, my husband and myself live in Florida and our son and daughter-in-law lived in, live in Ohio. And we happened to know that her, um, due date was January 1st and we wouldn't be able to make it. So we went up early for Christmas and we visited with, we were going to go visit them, but we stopped in Cleveland first and my, where my father-in-law lives and my daughter and son-in-law, my son and daughter-in-law live in Columbus. So we were at my father-in-law's and my daughter had also flown in from Florida. She just got there the night before and we stayed up really late. And then we woke up in the morning and we were going to go do stuff. And we got a call that said her water broke and that the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car, drove two and a half hours to Columbus and made it there before the baby was born. Just waiting in the waiting room with her mother and her stepfather and then getting the text that the baby was born and that they'd be out in a little bit. So it was a very exciting day. We got to go see the baby. We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off. So once again, I'd like to show you these pictures, take a little time and look at each one. And then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.

Cinderella finds out from the stepmother and stepsisters, who are very, very conniving and greedy, manipulatively planning to take the prince's hand for themselves. Cinderella finds a stash of her mother's clothing, and through the help of her friends, the mice and the birds, builds a beautiful dress, for she had been told by her stepmother that she would be allowed to go to the ball if she had a dress that fit and was good enough. Unfortunately, as part of what she made the dress from, there were pieces and leftovers of the stepsister's clothing. They fly into a rage and destroy Cinderella's dress, taking back those parts that once were theirs while the stepmother looks on, without bothering to stop them at all. Cinderella is distraught with grief, and as the stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball, she runs out to the garden and pours out her heart to the universe, which calls forth her fairy godmother, which then comes and gives her a wish, granting that a pumpkin in the garden be turned into a carriage, that the mice be turned into horses, and the horse be turned into a carriageman himself, and giving her an amazing outfit, a beautiful dress and glass slippers to wear.

As they went outside, they saw a huge fat pumpkin sitting there and a bunch of rats scattering around. Cinderella looked at it doubtfully, but after seeing what a beautiful dress she had created, she was open to everything. The fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a beautiful white horse-drawn carriage. Cinderella was absolutely shocked. You have to get off to the ball, she said. Time is wasted, but you have to be back by midnight. If you don't come back by midnight, all the magic will disappear. Remembering this warning, Cinderella jumped into the carriage, and she was off to the ball. When she arrived, she was unsure what to expect. She had never left the castle before. Her dark and dreary life had never been opened up in this way before. When she walked inside and saw the beautiful dresses and the shining earrings and the beautiful chandeliers, she was immediately taken back by its beauty. As she was going towards the ballroom dance floor, the prince himself was so humbled by her grace and by her beauty, by her innocence, and by her wonder. He immediately asked her to dance, and it was love at first sight. They saw the joy and the authenticity in each other and danced the night away. And right before midnight, Cinderella heard the clock strike, and she knew it was time for her to go. She had been so lost in this happiness and this dream that she completely lost track of time. She ran out of the palace as fast as she could, leaving a sliver behind on the step. Against his pleas for her to stay and to know her name, she ran off, knowing where her destiny was going to be. She hopped in the carriage and headed off home as its dumb, old, and lonely princess as it stumbled and turned back into a pumpkin, and the beautiful gallant horses became little fuzzy rats. She got back to her house just in time to safely go back up to her room in her rags, with a pumpkin being a pumpkin and rats being rats. But she had a new sense of mind, a new sense of wonder. She was no longer just the maid. She was no longer anybody else's peasant. She was her own princess. She was her own beauty, with a little bit of magic and with a little bit of hope. She knew that she could be more than what she thought she was before. She went the next couple of days being totally at peace. As the sisters demanded things, didn't faze her. As they asked for things, she obliged and stayed in the calm confinements of her mind. And then one day, there was a knock on the door, and it was an official from the castle. They announced that they were going around every house, having every maiden try on the slipper until they could find what was the maiden that the prince had been looking for from out of the ball. As he entered, the sisters pushed and pulled and fought their way to the front so that they could be the first to try the shoe on, demanding that they have the prince's full attention. They tried to fit their feet into the slippers, but it was too small and it was too delicate. Flinging it around between the two of them, the man decided that they were certainly not the woman. Cinderella peered around the corner, and one of the attendants noticed her. Is this another young woman that lives in the house? No, no, no. They tried to block her and cover her from sight. She's no one."}, {"filename": "NEURAL5-2_1373970_1608967.wav", "transcript": "Well, at that time there was a prince in the kingdom and the king decided that it was time for that prince to find a bride.

Well, an invitation went out to all of the young women of the kingdom and an invitation went to the home of this woman and her two daughters and her stepdaughter. She read the invitation aloud and the three girls were so excited about it. Well, Cinderella went off to her room. She opened up her trunk where she had an old dress and she and her little animal friends found ways to add ribbons and things to the dress to make it presentable for the ball. Her sisters at the same time were trying to make dresses for themselves and when they saw the very pretty dress that Cinderella had made, they ripped off the ribbons and they ripped off the beads and the necklace that she was wearing and they put them on their own dresses and ribbons until Cinderella was left with nothing presentable to wear to the ball and the stepsister said that she was not going to the ball. So off the stepsisters went to the ball that night. Cinderella was left at home. She was out in the garden crying when all of a sudden her fairy godmother appeared to her and the fairy godmother waved her magic wand. She turned the mice into horses. She turned the pumpkin in the garden into a carriage. So suddenly Cinderella had a way to get to the ball but she had no dress and the fairy godmother waved her magic wand until Cinderella's ragged dress turned into a beautiful ball gown. Off she went but before she headed off to the ball, the fairy godmother warned her that at midnight she must be out of the castle because her dress would return to rags, the carriage would return to a pumpkin, the horses would return to the mice that they once were. Cinderella then went off to the ball. When she arrived, all of a sudden the prince saw a completely new person enter. She was more beautiful, more lovely than all of the other women who were at the ball. His eye went directly to Cinderella and he asked her to dance. They danced and danced. He danced with no other woman the rest of the night and the two stepsisters didn't even recognize that this was Cinderella. But suddenly the clock struck midnight. Cinderella gasped as she ran out of the castle. The prince called for her. He didn't even know her name but she ran out of the castle, down the steps when suddenly her dress returned to rags and the carriage returned to a pumpkin. The horses became mice once again. The only thing she had left was one of the slippers because it had fallen off but she picked it up. Well, she went home and within a few days the prince said he had to find the princess and he saw that there was this slipper, the other slipper glass that was on the step. And he said, this was it.

When the mother arrived, she brought her Cheshire cat along and the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals were not treated as well, but Cinderella loved them all. She loved the horses and the dogs and the mice and they all loved her. As she was cleaning, she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle. In the castle, there was a wonderful prince, handsome, charming prince who was approaching the age to be married and the prince's servants and the king said that he had to choose himself a wife. And so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball and at that ball, all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time. Well, the stepmother got the invitation. She only considered her daughters and she didn't consider Cinderella at all. So she got her daughters, the beautiful gowns and the jewelry and they were ugly stepsisters and Cinderella made her own dress and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals, she made a beautiful little dress. And when she came out with her dress on, the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shredded and said that she is not going to go to the ball, that they are going to go to the ball, but she is not. So she was put into, locked into a room and she was visited by the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the ball. So the fairy godmother, with her magic, biddy-biddy-bobbity-boo, made sure that she had a very beautiful gown and out of a pumpkin she made a carriage and out of the mice she made horsemen, horses to carry the carriage to the palace. And she was dressed in the most beautiful woman in the land, but she did have a stipulation. She said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear. So she went to the ball and she was the belle of the ball and she caught the eye of the prince and the prince fell in love with her, much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters. So she danced the night away and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes and she knew that she had to run home or the magic of the night would disappear at that time. So she ran from the prince and as she did, one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps and she ran and she ran and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear, the magic of the night, the pumpkin returned to its former self and the animals were no longer horses and everything returned to itself, to what they were."}, {"filename": "NEURAL20-1_2018335_2253225.wav", "transcript": "And with that, she waved her magic wand again, do-do-do-do-do, and stardust fell all over the room, and now Cinderella was now outside in the courtyard.

And the horse, excuse me, the horse, suddenly there were six horses, and all of them were attired in beautiful plumage. And they became the horses that would draw the golden pumpkin carriage. So the fairy godmother helped Cinderella to climb up into the carriage, and off they went to the ball. Once they got there, the, Mayor Domo, I'm not sure what to call him, but the man who welcomed the guests, said, oh, who are you? And brought Cinderella up into the ballroom. And when the prince saw her come in, he dropped his attention to the stepsisters and all the other women in the room. And he was suddenly struck with awe at this gorgeous creature that had come into the room. And immediately he went over to her and he said, may I have this dance? And then for the next, for the rest of the ball, the prince danced only with Cinderella. But then there was a big clock in the room because Cinderella had been told by her stepmother that she could go to the ball, but she must come home by 12 o'clock. Because at 12 o'clock, she would go back to being her old self, Cinderella, the one who dusted the fireplace. And now she suddenly looked at the clock and it was two minutes before 12 o'clock. And she said to the prince, oh, I'm so sorry, but I have to go. No, he said, don't leave. And she said, I'm sorry, I have to. And with that, she broke away from him and she ran out of the castle, the palace, down the steps. But as she did, she lost one of her golden, one of her glass slippers that had been given to her by the fairy godmother. And the miredoma who was in charge of the guests ran after her and said, no, wait, come back, come back. She said, no, I can't. But she had lost her glass slipper, but he found it and he took it. Cinderella got into her carriage, but suddenly once again, she was just Cinderella. And the horses were just that one horse. And the dog was just the dog. He was no longer the footman. And the little mice were just little mice again. But who was that beautiful creature? Thought the prince. I must find her. And so he sent his emissaries out into the village. He had the glass slipper and he sent his servant who carried the glass slipper on a pillow. And they went to all the young, to the houses of all the young women in the land. And they finally got to the home of Cinderella. But Cinderella was locked inside a door up high in her room. But then the footman said, let me try the glass slipper on your daughters.

All her sisters were laughing at her, her mother was laughing at her, saying that you're not going, you're not allowed to go. You must stay behind and clean the house. So the sisters and the mother get all dressed up to go to this ball at the kingdom. And Cinderella was staying behind having to clean the house. She decided that she was going to try to go to the ball anyway. She had a very pretty dress that she kept dreaming about. And one day her fairy godmother showed up and told her that she could go to the ball. So she magically turned her into a princess, a beautiful gown. She turned the pumpkin into a carriage and some furry friends into horses. And off she went to the kingdom. She showed up to the kingdom and the king and prince were there. And the prince asked her to dance, didn't know who she was, thought she was a very pretty woman. They ended up dancing all night, got to be really late.

Somehow, her fairy godmother gets there. I think her fairy godmother just kind of appears. She doesn't really summon her in any way and gives her a really nice dress and glass slippers, carriage, and all that. She goes to the ball with that, dresses, dances with the prince. One of the stipulations her fairy godmother gave her was that it would all end at midnight. So it's like 11.45, and she rushes out to leave and go back to her home. One of her slippers falls off, but she just leaves it there. So she gets back home. I guess doesn't really think much of it, but the prince, who really liked her, finds the slipper and decides to have all the women in the area try the slipper on to see which one fits. Cinderella, she's friends with all the animals in her castle. She just helps them out. And they tell her about that or something, maybe summon the prince there.

You undo the jar for the peanut butter. Take a knife and get a scoop of it. Spread that on one of the pieces of bread and make it even. Then you undo the jar of jelly. Take a spoon. Get a scoop of that. Get a scoop or two, depending on how much you need. Put that on the other piece of bread on the flat, even surface and use the back of the spoon to spread it around. And then you put the part of the one bread that has the peanut butter on it on top of the other slice of bread that has the jelly on it.

That is interesting. How was recovery from that injury? That was the story. That was my latest health story. It took a long time, and around this time, two years ago, we were going on a trip to New Jersey and Philadelphia, and I couldn't drive. I didn't drive for about four months, so my wife ended up driving the whole, being close to 3,000 miles once we were back from that trip, including going to Oak Ridge Lab in Tennessee, and it was strange, gradually getting more emotion and gradually getting more strength back, and it was an odd experience. Well, thank you for sharing. Now, can you tell me of an experience that you've had with someone who has had a difficult time communicating? Interesting question. Well, the only experiences of that sort of thing were most recently in 2018. In 2018, first in February, my mother-in-law, who at that point was living at a care center in Bloomington, gradually lost the ability to communicate very well because of health problems, and just reaching a point where she wasn't conscious a lot of the time, and when she was conscious, she wasn't conscious a lot of the time, and when she was, wasn't communicating very well, and she died in February of that year, and then my father-in-law in Gainesville, Florida, we were there in January, and he was doing pretty well, but in March, he was in the hospital, but communicating fairly well, but having some issues, but was much improved when we came back here, but then he had a downturn and died in April, and then when we were in Philadelphia in May of that year, my mother had some serious decline in health, and when the whole family was at her room in intensive care in Philadelphia, there were times when you could talk to her, and she would notice, and other times that she didn't, and then sometimes she'd be talkative and make sense, and other times not."}, {"filename": "wright61a_45531_280088.wav", "transcript": "The little girl's pet cat climbed very high into a tree, and she was so upset.

The mother, in the meantime, had obviously called the fire brigade to get Dad down out of the tree, and that's the end of the story as I see it. We were living in L.A., and we lost our house in an earthquake, at which time we decided to move to Arizona. Shortly after we arrived in Arizona, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me, because I knew no one here. I had no friends. Luckily, I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me and put me on a drug, which I had to take, called Tamoxifen. I live in the lakes in Tampe, which is a very pleasant place to live. And over the years, over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication, I got to know very many friends who were extremely good, very supportive to me, and I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time, and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been 11 years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and up till now, touch wood, there is no recurrence of it. I can remember when I first, I worked for the BBC. I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney, Australia, and when I left with my German husband, when I left Australia to come back to Germany, my German, my gift of the German language was not very large, and I already had one child who was born in Australia, and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home, and I had to do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could, which wasn't very easy, because I had a sister-in-law who was not very kind at that time, and every time I made a mistake in Germany, she used to laugh and make fun of me, and I used to be very resentful about that, but because I was, I guess, so ambitious at that time, and because I was good at dialects, and I think this has something to do with musical ability, because I'm able to hear how a language sounds, I learned, I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year, I would say, and that's all I could say about language difficulties. Very much so. I was four years old when the Second World War started, and I was living in Cardiff at that time, which is the capital of Wales, and we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit, and my parents had decided to send me to stay, to live with my grandparents, who lived closer to the coast in Wales, and about two days before I was due to depart to live with my grandparents, our house was flattened.

So in fact, they made her do all the work and all of the chores. This other girl, the daughter of the husband, her name was Cinderella, and they made her do lots and lots of work. She was very, very kind, however, to the animals because they were really the only friends she had. Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace. And what was happening in the palace at the time was that it was time for the prince to be married. And so his father was saying that he needed to decide who he was going to marry. So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village. So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family. Her stepmother received the invitation, and her stepmother told her daughters about it who got very excited, but they didn't really say anything to Cinderella. The daughters started preparing their dresses and getting things ready for the ball, but they were not going to give a dress to Cinderella. So she went into her treasure chest. She opened up a book and had some old fabric in it, and she looked at that and decided to make herself a dress for the ball. But then when the time came for the sisters to all go to the ball, they said, oh, you need to fix my dress and you need to fix my dress. And they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs. And before long, she had nothing to wear to the ball, and they were not going to have her go with them. So off the sisters went. Cinderella was so sad. She went out into the garden, and there she saw, happened to see a pumpkin and the mice, and pretty soon a fairy godmother appeared. And the fairy godmother said to Cinderella some magical words, and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage. She turned the mice into horsemen or something or horses, and she turned Cinderella's ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown. Cinderella went to the ball, but the fairy godmother said, you must leave by midnight because then the coach will become a pumpkin and your dress will turn back to rags. Cinderella walked into the ball and the prince and she began to dance, but at midnight the clock struck and she knew she had to leave, so she ran out of the castle. She ran down the steps, and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers. She ran and ran into the fields until indeed her dress returned to rags. And the coach turned back into a pumpkin. And one of the mice had a key for some, oh, I know, because I guess they locked her up or something. I can't remember why, what was going on in that picture. But the mice unlocked the key, oh, yeah, because the prince was coming to see whose foot fit that glass slipper, because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry. And when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe, they tried the shoe on the two sisters and it didn't fit, but Cinderella was locked up. But the mice found the key, unlocked Cinderella's room, so she came running down, she tried on the slipper, it fit, and then the prince knew that she was the one he wanted to marry.

So, it so happened he, on the plane down there, for no special reason, there was one fellow on the plane, changed his seat to another seat. And then my son wanted to move also. I don't remember why. I don't know why he wanted to move, but he wanted to move. So, he sat next to this first fellow who moved. He sat next to him. Well, they struck up a conversation, and this other fellow happened to be a pastor down in Haiti. I think he had about four churches. So, they became acquainted, and my son was down there to look to help people. And so, pastor said the next day that he wanted to take him around and show him around the countryside, which he did. And on the way back to my son's hotel, Hotel Montana, the earthquake struck, and my son wanted to go right on back to the hotel, back up a little bit. But the pastor wanted to take him off to another spot and show him another area, a church or something. They looked at some churches. And so, for that reason, my son was not in the hotel when the earthquake hit. Otherwise, he would have been killed because that hotel was flattened, as we all know, for Montana. And so, but my son said the truck started shaking and bouncing and bouncing around on the road, and they realized the road was kind of on a mountainside. So anyway, they finally, I think, got back into Port-au-Prince there and saw what had happened, and it was horrible. And they tried to help people and do what they could do, but there wasn't much they could do with just their hands. They had no tools or anything. Well, everybody knows the story, how bad it was and how bad it got. He tried to help people, and he tried to encourage them, you know, hang in there, hang in there. Well, it got dark, it was pitch dark. There was no lights of any kind. And they did what they could do. The next morning, these people were dead. They tried to hang in there, you know, encourage. So they prayed with people, and they carried people down the road to the medical, where people were trying to take care of them. And it was just horrible.

Could you please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it? Okay, well, problems communicating is vast. Um, so I, you know, I'm not, the person I'm thinking of doesn't have any kind of speech impediment and this is a different person than the other person, but it'll, I'll be brief. So this person doesn't express themselves all the time. You know, we can have extremely awkward conversations. And then other times it goes well. So I've learned a couple things. One is that helped me communicate with this person. One is don't ask questions because they don't like questions. And the other is to get them at the right time of day or a good, or if he calls me, he usually will have something to say. But if I really feel like I need to talk to him, I know not to call him in the morning, you know, and I know to hang up if he's busy and he'll tell me.

The prospect of their daughters being the princess and Cinderella as an eligible woman actually should get to go. And they're like oh yes if you get all of your work done you can go I guess. So Cinderella makes plans to sort of to wear her mother's gown. And her animal friends thinks it would be really nice to sort of upgrade her mom's dress by adding ribbon and beads and things to kind of work the ensemble, accessorize basically. And and so Cinderella works really hard and meanwhile her animal friends are making her dress better. And she gets done and then she sees her dress and she's very happy. She gets ready to go to the ball and her stepsisters stop her and they snatch off her necklace and they tear the sash from her dress and basically leave her dress in ruins. And so she couldn't go to the ball that way. So she's out in the garden crying and her animal friends are really sad because she doesn't get to go to the ball and her fairy godmother comes. And the fairy godmother arrives and helps her come up with a way to go to the ball. And she starts by making a pumpkin into a carriage and turning the animal friends into different, um, a driver, a horseman, and the she turns the mice into horses and the horse into a man, which doesn't make sense. But um she makes the how to get there work first. And then she she's about to send Cinderella off and Cinderella's like, I can't go like this. And so the fairy godmother needed to be redirected to help her with her dress."}, {"filename": "wright33a_608635_843021.wav", "transcript": "One day, as a boy was heading to school, his mother told him that it was supposed to rain and told him to take an umbrella. The boy said, no, I'll be fine, mom. And the mother was hesitant, but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella. And the boy was walking to school, and it started to rain, and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did. And so he ran back home as the rain got harder, splashing in the puddles. And Wetly came in the door saying nothing, but showing his mother that she was indeed right. And the mother was annoyed, but knew that giving the boy the umbrella is really the best thing for his health and well-being, so she gave it to him. And he walked in the rain with the umbrella, and his mother's love, the end. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella, I would guess. It was a little girl, and her father was widowed, and so he remarried. And the new stepmother had two daughters, the girl's age, and the stepmother was not very nice. And as the dad got out of the picture by an unfortunate series of events, the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave, and turned her into basically a scullery maid, and made her clean out the fireplace, which is why she's actually called Cinderella. So I don't know what her name was before. And one day, a message came from the castle, and said that there was a ball, so the prince could find a wife. And Cinderella was excited, and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress, and the, let's just call her the wicked stepmother. The wicked stepmother was not interested in letting Cinderella go, so when Cinderella came downstairs, she instigated a jealousy war with her daughters, and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress? Actually not Cinderella, she didn't do that at all. And they had taken things from the sisters, so the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress. Cinderella was very sad, but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle. And as Cinderella cried in the garden, her rather plump fairy godmother came and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown, turned the mice into coachmen and horses, and turned a pumpkin into a coach, and Cinderella went to the castle, the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her, what are the chances, and as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight, the magic would wear off."}, {"filename": "richardson37_23124_257505.wav", "transcript": "John kicked a ball, it went through the window, and landed on his angry next-door neighbor's lap, and his next-door neighbor walked to the window and looked out. Great, thank you. Okay, so now I'm gonna ask you, have you ever heard of Cinderella? Yes, I have. Okay, I'm gonna ask you to tell the story of Cinderella. But these pictures might help you remember how it goes. Take a look at the pictures, and then I'm gonna take away the book and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. Okay. I like the way the words are spelled. All right, okay, go ahead. So, Cinderella lived with her father, her father remarried, her evil stepmother had two evil stepsisters, and then her father died, and the stepmother put her to work, and she had to clean up the house, and they were very mean to her. Very, very mean to her. She had a fairy godmother, and there was a ball, and the fairy godmother changed her into this beautiful ball gown, and she got to get the ball, she met the prince, but then everything went away at midnight, she ran away, but she left her glass slipper. The prince ran around looking for the girl that the glass slipper fit, it fit Cinderella, and they left her out. Okay, very nice. Okay, so now we're moving on to something a little different. Can you tell me, pretend like I've never made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tell me how to make one, okay? You get your bread out of the pantry, you take two slices of bread out, you get your peanut butter out of the refrigerator or the pantry, wherever you keep it, and spread peanut butter on the bread, and then you spread jelly on the other side of the bread, put the two pieces together, and cut it in half, and then cut the crust off if it's for my children. Great, thank you. Okay, so now I'm going to present another picture series for you. Yeah. They, take a look at all of them, and I'm going to ask you to tell me another story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. You can look at the pictures as you tell the story, and whenever you're ready. Okay, so it's the morning, and it's school time, and the mom says, it's going to rain today, son, and he's like, oh no, mom, I'm fine, I do not need an umbrella, and lo and behold, it starts to rain, and he comes home soaking wet, and he's like, mom, you were right, because your mom was right. And then the next day, he took an umbrella and stayed dry. Okay, very good. Okay, so here's another picture. Look at everything that's happening, and tell me a story about what you see. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, whenever you're ready. So, little Julie had a cat, and the cat went to the tree, and she said, daddy, daddy, go get my cat, and so daddy got the ladder, and climbed up to get the cat, and then the ladder fell, and he couldn't get to the cat, so then the cat and daddy were stuck in the tree. The dog was going crazy, because everybody's in the tree, Julie's crying, and they called the firemen, and they're coming to rescue everybody. Great, thank you. So have you ever heard of the story Little Red Riding Hood? Yes. Okay, so here's the story. You can look at the pictures, and then I'm gonna ask you to tell me, I'm gonna take away the book and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. I didn't realize she could fly. Okay? Okay, so tell me as much of the story of Little Red Riding Hood as you can. You can use any details you know about the story, as well as anything you gained from the pictures you just saw. So apparently Little Red Riding Hood can fly. For the first time. But she wanted to go see her grandmother, so she packed her basket, and she was walking through the woods, and she came upon a wolf."}, {"filename": "wright15a_504138_738506.wav", "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella. She had a happy life with her mother and her father. And her mother died. She was sad when she grew up. Her father decided to get remarried. And he married a woman that had two other daughters as well. Cinderella's stepsisters. And he was a busy man, so he was always off politicking. Leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters. And her stepmother wasn't very nice. And as she got older, more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden of being a rich daughter fell upon her. And her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them. It wasn't a happy life. One day, a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married. And so the king said, Prince, we're going to have a ball so that you can meet some ladies to be married. An invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball. And she was happy, and so she went to get ready for the ball. And Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as well, but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done. Which was kind of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear. So the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house, including things that belonged to other people. And she slaved away the day. And so eventually it was time to go to the ball, and Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready. The stepsisters and the mother were happy, but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made, and she was excited because then she could go to the ball. So she ran down the stairs to leave. And the sisters, seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them, tore her dress apart. So she wasn't able to go in shambles while the stepmother's staff watched. And so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball, while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince. And as she was crying, her fairy godmother appeared and introduced herself and said that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out. So they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach. And a big beautiful dress, and she was all ready to go to the ball. And so she headed off, and the prince danced with a few people, but saw Cinderella come through the door and then dance the night away with her and no one else really. He was very infatuated. The fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight, everything would go back to normal, and so Cinderella lost track of time and was about to strike midnight. She realized what had happened and so she ran, and as she was running she lost one of her slippers. The prince was chasing after her, trying to find out who she was. She was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear."}, {"filename": "NEURAL24-2_709333_943613.wav", "transcript": "So the neighbor got up and got mad and looked out the window and yelled at the little boy for kicking his soccer ball through his window. The end. All right, again, these pictures tell a story. Take a minute to look at them and then when you're ready, please tell me what story you see with a middle and an end. One day a little boy was getting ready to go to school and his mom said, it's going to rain today, you'd better take an umbrella. And the little boy said, no, I don't want an umbrella. Bye mom, he went out the door and started to walk to school. But halfway there, it started to rain. It started sprinkling just at first and then it started raining harder and harder. So he ran home soaking wet and his mom said, I told you so. And then he took the umbrella and he went back to school. The end. All right, and I think this is actually our last one. So whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see in this picture with the beginning, a middle and an end. Once upon a time, a little girl was playing outside, riding her tricycle with her cat and her dog. And her cat got away from her and ran up and got stuck in a tree. So she called for her dad because the cat was stuck in the tree. So her dad went and got a ladder and climbed up in the tree to try to go get the cat. But the cat got scared and ran out on a tiny little branch and the dad couldn't reach it. And when he was trying to move, the ladder fell over and he couldn't get down. At that time, the girl's dog went crazy and started barking at the dad and the cat in the tree. So they had to call 911 and the fireman came with their ladder and they saved the day. They got the dad down, they got the cat down and everybody was happy. The end. All right, so remember with Cinderella, I'm gonna show you the picture book. They automatically move forward after 30 seconds. However, I can move forward if you're ready before then and we can go back and review any of them after we finish going through the book. And then I'll take it away and ask you to tell me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The end. Anything you wanna review? Nope. All right, so whenever you are ready, go ahead and tell me the story of Cinderella. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cinderella and she lived alone with her dad in a little village because her mother died when she was young. One day her dad decided that he needed to get married again so that she would have a mother. So he met and he married a widow that had two small girls of her own. And all things seemed good at first. She was kind of mean, but she was okay until Cinderella's dad died. And then the stepmother got very, very mean and her daughters were very, very mean also. They made Cinderella do everything around them."}, {"filename": "NEURAL11-1_271901_506090.wav", "transcript": "So then we started pursuing the adoption route and very interesting. I never thought that all how I never thought how complicated it was to do that and and all that goes into that and it was a long process and probably took close to a year. We went through a domestic adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute so that was kind of heartbreaking at the time and then finally adopted my daughter when she was about two months old. So you know we always say we were just waiting for her and and of course she always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her and we didn't have any choice with him he's just what we got. So you know I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because I gave birth to a child and also I adopted a child. I think it gave me interesting insight to both sides of it and there's certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well but you know a lot of people say oh I could never adopt it wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah she's my child just like my son is there's no difference between them so and she and she is interesting too because she says that she wants to adopt when she's ready to start a family that she would like to adopt a child from the foster system so I think that's kind of interesting her perspective on that. All right same idea here take a look at these pictures they also tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end and again you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. A little boy was playing soccer in his yard and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp. The dad stood up got the ball and looked out the window and glared at his little boy. These pictures tell a story take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end and you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school and his mother said Johnny you need to take an umbrella it's going to rain today and he said mom it's not raining I don't need an umbrella and he left and sure enough as he got halfway to school it started raining and then it started raining harder so he turned around and he went back home and told his mom you were right it started raining and she was not very happy with him and so he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school. So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this store in this picture and then tell me a story about what you see um ideally a story with a beginning a middle and an end. Okay so the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard and she was playing with her cat and her dog and all of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree and so she was very upset and she called for her dad and she said dad Sparky has chased peanut up the tree and so the dad said well let me see if I can go get the cat so Sparky's still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree dad climbed up the tree but he couldn't reach the cat the cat's scared to death."}, {"filename": "richardson195_397193_631257.wav", "transcript": "Um, so there was a wealthy widow with a daughter, and the daughter also had a dog, who remarried to a not-so-nice woman with her not-so-nice children, and they had an evil cat. And so eventually the father passed away. And the daughters and the mother just kind of ransomed Cinderella's life. They made her their servant, in a nutshell. And Cinderella did everything that she was asked to, even though she didn't like it, but she always dreamed of being a princess at the castle. And so, conveniently, the king wanted the prince to be married and made the duke in charge of it, or the general, I think it was the duke, if I recall. And he made him in charge of getting the son to be married, so they decided to put on a ball. So the invitations are sent out, and Cinderella gets one, as well do the evil stepsisters. And the stepsisters are going to go, and Cinderella asks that she can go, and the stepmother says that she can, but she has to do all of her chores and find a dress. So Cinderella's animal friends make her a dress, the birds and the mice. And then when she gets all presentable and she goes downstairs to leave, they tear her dress up and tell her that she can't go. And so then they leave, and she's very sad, and her fairy godmother shows up out of nowhere and says that she'll give her all the things that she needs, but it expires at midnight, and it's a blessing. And so Cinderella gets a nice dress and a carriage, and the mice are turned into her guards or whatever. And she's brought to the castle and to the ball, and the prince immediately rushes to her, much to the hatred of the stepsisters and mother. And, you know, they have a good time, and they fall in love, but it hits midnight, and so all of her stuff starts disintegrating, and the advisor to the prince, the general or duke or whatever his name was, chases after her, but she gets away, but she drops a slipper on one of her shoes, and everything else goes away except for her shoes. And so she's left with one, and they have one, and so the prince says that he wants to, and she goes back home, and the prince says that he wants to, like, find her, so he decides to try the shoe on every woman. And so eventually at some point he gets to their house, and the stepsisters can't fit in it, and the stepmother doesn't fit in it, so they try Cinderella, and it's a perfect fit, and it's a match made in heaven, and happy endings, so. Alright, awesome. Okay, and then one more, um, one more story. It's a little bit different. I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I have never made one before. Okay. Do I assume that you already have all the ingredients available, or do you need to go and get them? Um, it's kind of up to you. I'm just gonna assume you already have them. Okay. So, first you're going to want to take the twist tie, take the bread, take the twist tie off, open it, take off the first piece of bread, the heel loaf, um, the heel of the loaf, take it out, take two pieces of bread, place them on a plate, so one side's facing up on each one. And you're gonna want to take a knife, and then place it into the peanut butter, and scrape peanut butter onto the knife."}, {"filename": "wright57a_380166_613983.wav", "transcript": "Okay, Cinderella's father married a woman, which became her stepmother, and the stepmother had two daughters, and so they all moved in together, and then the father died, and so Cinderella was left in the care of the wicked stepmother, and she was very mean to her and made her work very hard and do all the chores, and the stepsisters were very mean also, and they called her names and made her do all their chores as well, and so she made friends with all the animals, and because she was lonely, and then an announcement came, someone came to the door and announced that there was going to be a ball, and so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball, and since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters, the mother didn't want her to go because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince, so she locked Cinderella in the tower, and they went to the ball, and so the animals made, oh, well, this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress, and it was real pretty, and that's what infuriated the stepmother, and she tore up the dress, and then locked her in the room, and then Cinderella was crying, and then the fairy godmother came and let her out of the room, and with the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers, and fixed her hair all up nice, and turned a pumpkin into a coach, turned mice into white horses, and the dog into a coachman, and so she was able to go to the ball, and she met the prince, danced with him, and the fairy godmother told her that she had to leave by midnight, or they would return as it was, and so she was dancing with the prince, and the clock started to strike midnight, and she said, I have to go, and he didn't want her to leave, but she started to run away, and she lost one of the glass slippers, and she ran, and ran, and got back in the coach, and they started going down the road, and then everything, when the clock struck 12, turned back to the way it was, and she was very sad, but she had a good time, and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers, and so she went home, and then the next day, and the prince really liked her, so, and he had this glass slipper, so he sent out a decree to find this woman with the glass slipper."}, {"filename": "NEURAL28-1_611418_845198.wav", "transcript": "And then the fire department came with the letter and hopefully got them down.

And she created with her fairy wand the dress that Cinderella would wear, and the clothing for the footmen, and the lovely coats that the horses had. And the whole thing was just top of the line, just wow. So that they lined up at the door, and with all these magical improvements, and the fairy godmother remembered to say, you've got to come home by midnight because it all goes back to the way it was before when the clock goes. Cinderella was just wow, just having a wonderful time. And as she got to the palace, the prince saw her. Oh, boy, that was it. So she got to dance with the prince more than once, and the next thing you knew, the clock was striking, and all of a sudden came to her, I'm overdue, I'm overdue, I've got to go. So she runs out, and the prince tries to catch up with her, doesn't really make it. And all he sees is this ash girl running down the stairs, and happened to be a glass slipper on the stairway where she had passed by. He catches the slipper and takes it back in and tries to find whom I'd left behind. Well, nobody fit it, so they made arrangements to visit the community out beyond the castle, and all the young ladies were going to try on the slipper. And those two older girls really weren't that good looking, but they were going to try the shoe on anyway. And there was sort of some hard feelings about who got to put the shoe on and so forth. And once they got to Cinderella's house, and she tried on the shoe, and it fit, and her fairy godmother appeared, and wow, there it was. And she got to go up to the castle with the prince, with the two not quite so attractive sisters running along behind."}, {"filename": "wright84a_325430_558600.wav", "transcript": "I'm sure in travels we've been looking at things along a biome and asking questions they can't, so you just hand and foot, motioning, and you get things across.

Unbeknownst to him, she had been married before, and she had two daughters of her own. And so, all of a sudden, he went from having to support three people to five. But, he did his best, and they lived fairly well. As the girls grew up, Ella's stepsisters began to treat her unfairly. They realized that their stepfather loved her far more than they loved them, and they didn't understand why. So, they would tease her, and her stepmother would ask all the girls to do chores around the house. But, eventually, it just became Ella's responsibility to clean. So, her final chore was to clean the hearth, and she would get Cinder's ashes all over her. And so, they gave her the nickname Cinder. Anyway, now all of the girls are in their teens, and the prince, the local prince, has decided to have a ball. His mother wants him to get married. And so, he invites all of the eligible women from the land to come to the ball. And so, the two sisters, of course, get very excited, and their mother helps them choose their dresses. But, they figure Cinderella doesn't want to go. You know, she's not very sophisticated, and she's always dirty. So, they just don't bother with her. So, Cinderella's very sad that she can't go to the ball. And so, she's just sitting in the corner over by the hearth, and they've all left. And all of a sudden, boom! All of the lights flash, and this little woman, this little old lady, is suddenly standing there in front of her. And she says that she's her fairy godmother, and that she's there to grant Cinderella's wishes. So, Cinderella says, Oh, I wish I could go to the ball. So, her fairy godmother taps her with her wand, and Cinderella is suddenly in this beautiful dress. And she taps her feet, and she has this beautiful glass leather top. And she taps the pumpkin, and it turns into this coach. And she taps the mice, and they turn into the coachman. And she taps the rat, and he becomes the horse. And off Cinderella goes to the ball. So, she arrives at the ball, and the prince only has eyes for her. She's the most beautiful woman in the world. And they went dancing all night.

And she had a magic mirror, and she asked the mirror if she was the fairest in all the land, and she usually was, until one day there was another girl who was more fair than she was, and her name was Snow White. And so I guess her spell would be broken if there was someone fairer than she was. So she asked a huntsman to go and find Snow White and kill her. And Snow White, I don't know what she did. I guess she just kind of lived in the forest. She played with animals and stuff, and she was dreaming of finding her Prince Charming. And I think she might have found him or not first. But anyways, a huntsman came to find her, so she ran away, and she ran into the dark forest. And she ended up at this house, and she really liked the house.

Again, you can use the same story that you shared last week or you can tell a different story. Well, you know, I'm trying not to belabor the same points. But you know, one of my more fun memories from one of my more fun memories was surprising our daughter with a trip to Disney World when she was six, about six. I travel a fair amount for my job, or at least I used to, not going anywhere right now. But she grew up with the Disney princesses. She loved Disney movies. When she was really little, like two or three, and this is probably a testament to bad parenting, we had to stop letting her watch Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks because she was developing a British accent. And so that was kind of problematic for us and we had to kind of dial back that frequency with which she was watching those movies. But that's how much she was really into Disney. So we got up early one morning and we told her that we're driving me to the airport because I've got this, you know, I've got to fly out for work. And then when we got to the airport, when we turn around, we're like, that's not really what's happening. We're getting on it. You know, you were all packed. We're going to Disney World. And I was so excited to see her reaction. And she did not react at all. It was like, what? And then we repeated it and it was like, we kind of thought, well, maybe when it sinks in she'll be like really excited. No, she's like, oh, okay. And that was it. It was as much reaction as we got from this like uber Disney child with a surprise visit to Disney. It was a memorable reaction fail. But I enjoyed it anyway. Same thing here.

I met a lot of people, and I prospered more too than I probably would had I stayed in education. That's not a knock on education. It's just that I was lucky.

In addition to that, the theological seminary down there had bought a large apartment, and they had turned out the people in that so that their students would have a place to live. And really, to find a place to live was very, very tough. My wife was pregnant with our first child, obvious because the baby was born about a month after we moved back to Kentucky.

There are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. One of them is to get out the bread that's already cut and put peanut butter on it, actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store and so all you have to do is just use one and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into the jar and you can put it right on the bread and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Very lazy, very easy. The good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread, cut it in 6 inch long pieces, slice it long ways so that it's open, it's nice and crunchy on top, it's very soft on the interior, you take your peanut butter, crunchy and regular, you mix those together, you put it on the peanut, you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich, you take the jelly, I wouldn't use grape jelly, but you can use other kinds of jelly and I like strawberry, sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together. I put it on there and then I take that sandwich and I put it in the microwave and I heat it so that the peanut butter, the jelly and the bread all soak in together. I still have crunchy on the top, but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm and then I eat that.

So he comes back home and his mother he sees his mother and she looks like she's got her hands on her hips and she's like, well I told you so and he apparently agrees with that because then he takes off again and he has the umbrella and it's protecting him from the rain. He apparently retrieves the umbrella after he goes back to his house and starts out again. This is a picture of two people. One looks like a rescuer because he has on an orange vest and the other one is a young woman. She apparently has fallen into a raging stream or river or some body of water that seems to be moving and then the rescuer tries to come to rescue her. He has a belt that he has, you know, and he's grasping a, well he could not be a rescuer, he could also be another boater that had a life jacket and she doesn't have the life jacket so I don't know which it is. Anyway, the man who has the red life jacket on is grasping a branch and the woman is nearby. Both of them look pretty distressed. This is a story about Cinderella. Cinderella had two stepsisters and her mother was a stepmother who favored the stepsisters over Cinderella and so Cinderella had to serve them tea and do, I guess, many of the household chores while the stepsisters didn't have to do anything. There was an announcement of an impending ball that the prince was having and the stepsisters, well all of the girls were invited, but it was decided that only the stepsisters could go and that they would have the grand ball gowns, but Cinderella was, you know, feeling very dejected and she, you know, kept doing her chores and everything."}, {"filename": "richardson189_19743_251991.wav", "transcript": "So this little boy is just out kicking around the soccer ball in his yard He gets carried away Kicks it too hard accidentally kicks it through the window breaks the window It lands in his dad's lap after it breaks a lamp And his dad just kind of catches it looks out the window to see who it is Realizes it's his son All right Same thing with these pictures having I might have you tell me a sort of a beginning a middle and an end whenever you're ready So the mom Is telling her son that he needs to take an umbrella to school. He's like no, it's not raining I don't need an umbrella and He just leaves without it to go to school, but then it starts raining So he just runs back home And she's pretty upset with him but still Gives him the umbrella and makes him go to school. Anyways, so he does that All right Same thing with this one. It's a little bit different. It's kind of an entire scene. So you want to look at the entire picture And then tell me a sort of a beginning and middle and an end So a dog is chasing a cat and the cat Runs up the tree to escape the dog The little girl it's her cat So her dad goes up the tree to get the cat for her But the ladder falls and he can't really get back down and neither can he get the cat? So they end up calling the fire department to come get the dad That's kind of where the story leaves off. We assume that they probably get him and the cat down successfully Okay, have you heard of the story of Cinderella yeah, okay, I'm gonna have you look through this book There are no words in here just the pictures But take as much time as you need to look through all the pictures and then whenever you're done I'm gonna take the book back and have you tell me the story as best you can I Have you tell me the story of Cinderella as best you can you can use any details You know about this story as well as the pictures that you just looked at so it's the King who lives in a castle with his daughter Cinderella Cinderella's mother his wife died"}, {"filename": "NEURAL20-1_1013748_1245893.wav", "transcript": "Well, in the beginning, there is a boy playing with his soccer ball, and he gives it a good kick, and it goes through the window of, must be a neighbor. Bounces through the window, breaks the window, bounces through, and lands almost in the lap of the neighbor who is sitting inside. The neighbor picks up the soccer ball, and he goes to the window, and he looks out. We need a few more pictures. We don't know what happens next. But I imagine that he sees the boy out there, and the boy is standing out there, absolutely. He feels terrible that he has broken the man's window, and he's shouting into the man, sir, I am so, so sorry I have broken your window. And the man said, oh, I was a boy once, too. These things happen. We can work together to find a way to repair the window. And so they did. So this slide has a series of pictures that tell a different story. So again, just take some time to look over them, and then tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle, and an end. Are they mixed up, these pictures? No, ma'am, they go in order. Okay. Thank you. All right. So are the pictures gonna stay here while I tell the story? Yes, I'm not gonna take any more pictures away from you. Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was on his way to school, and his mother said, the weather report says it's going to rain. Here, you take this umbrella. He said, no, I don't wanna take the umbrella. Well, you better. You might get wet. Nope, I'm not going to. So the little boy began walking to school, and sure enough, his mother was right. It began to rain. And then it began to rain harder and harder and harder, and he splashed through the puddles, and he ran back to his home, and he said, I was wrong. And she said, yes, you were. Try it again. We'll dry you off. Go to school, but this time with an umbrella. And so he did, and so he stayed dry on his trip to school. So this picture tells a story. Take a second to look at it, and then tell me what story you see with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat, and the cat was chased by a dog, and the cat ran up the tree and wailed onto the limb as the dog stood barking there. And then she called her dad, and she said, daddy, come and help me. Help me get my cat down. So the next thing that happened was that the father tried to climb the tree, and he got partway up, and then he got stuck, and he could not get down, and the cat wouldn't come down. And somebody must have seen this and called the fire department, because finally they came with their ladders, and they probably shooed away the dog, and they put the ladder up against the tree, and they helped the father down, and then, I'm gonna say the cat jumped down of his own free will.

I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell. It was just, it had no, like, you know that old song, what a difference a day makes? I mean, from the pregnancy, which was just wonderful. I ate everything I wanted. I felt terrific. I was working full time. My freezer looked like an orietta convention. I could eat, you know, my crinkle cuts, my shoestrings with pasta. I could do anything. I looked like meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital, I have to say. My obstetrician, you know, during the buildup to this would say, you'll be sorry. And I said, you know, I cannot imagine regretting this. You know, I'm eating, I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the, it's two pieces of pound cake, you know, with the Haagen-Dazs in the middle. So then I get to the hospital and it was really nasty. It was really, it was probably the worst experience I ever had. I was told that if I had automatic weapons, there would have been no one alive left on the maternity ward. Yeah. That's what I was told. And I did, it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out. You know, my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook. He said, well, we're just gonna break your water, it'll move things along. I said, no, don't, step back, step back. Just leave me alone, I can do this myself, you know. And then he kept saying, relax. I don't understand why you're not relaxed. And this is psychological, I'm sure. Every time he said relax, I became even more infuriated. You know, this is the effect it had on me. And he wasn't listening when I said, stop saying that. When you tell someone stop doing X, you expect them to stop doing that. So anyhow, to fast forward, my daughter was beautiful. She was born smiling right away, recognized my voice. It was just the most special experience of my whole life. And so now I went for my first postpartum checkup. And I'm sitting on the table and he, you know, does the finger pricks and to get some blood out and he turns around and he puts the little tube in the machine and he turns it on and the machine is whirring. And I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock. It happened really fast and I threw him onto the table. And then I jumped on top of him, put my knee in his groin and I was, his glasses were askew and his tie was crooked and I said, relax, relax. Relax, I don't understand why you're not relaxed. What's the matter? It was such a calamity. Although, you know, it was all in good fun because later on, you know, he and his wife used to work in his office and they had a nurse too. And they said, selfishly, Linda, we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives. It's really selfish on our part. So that was it.

I would take and spread the peanut butter on the one piece of bread, and then take the spoon and drop some jelly on the other piece of bread, and spread the jelly evenly over that piece of bread, put the two pieces together. Ready? We have a real pickle here. Looks like the family cat has been chased up the tree by their dog, and the father has gone to rescue the cat, his daughter, and just crying, wanting the cat to come down. She's off her tricycle. The father gets up on the limb of the tree, the stepladder falls down, and then to the rescue somebody must have called\u2014there's a bird watching it all\u2014but somebody must have called the fire department, and here they come running with the ladder. All right, I haven't had a stroke, but I did have a couple of stents done two years ago, this past February, and I smoked up until that time, up until about two days before then. That was February the 9th or 10th, and the surgery was on a Wednesday, and the procedure. And Monday I ran out of cigarettes, and I had one Sunday morning, and I thought, heck, oh Pete, I don't want\u2014I'm not going to do any smoking, they're going to make me stop anyway once I get in the hospital. So then I had that last one Monday morning, and I haven't smoked since then. But getting back to my story, Wednesday at 1 a.m., I'd already been to the doctor. He had done a stress test, and he said that we needed to look at you more closely, and what they do is they put you somewhat under, and they go up through your groin with a camera and take a good look at your heart. So I was sort of out of it, but I do remember it, and I remember the doctor's name was Richard\u2014I can't think of the last name, but they called him Rapid Richard, because he was so quick. And he went in, and I says, I must have woke up, I said, well, doc, are you there? He says, yep, I'm there. And I said, how's it look? He says, well, we're going to have a couple of stents put in, and there's some\u2014got some problems. Oh gosh, I says, all right. Must have gone back out. A little bit later on, I said, well, how you doing, doc, are you about done? And he says, just finishing up.

That's probably like the singular event that's most significant. Okay, I'll tell you a story. This is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind and I still don't make any sense. So my first semester, my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa in Iowa City, but my family's from D.C. And I had a car, so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car. It's about a thousand miles, so it generally takes about two days. So the first semester back, it's winter, I am driving across I-80, which goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn, so it's an extremely boring, repetitive drive. There's a lot of driver tunnel vision that happens and it's cold and gray, so it's not even pretty green fields, it's just empty, empty, empty fields. But I'm kind of proud of myself because my first semester went well, I was independent, excited. So I'm on I-80 in sort of the middle of Illinois and there's a slowdown and it's very flat, so I can see ahead, I don't see that there's construction. I don't really see an accident, but I figure something's happened, probably a minor accident, looks like it's a rubbernecking delay, it's kind of pissing me off. I-80 at this point is only two lanes in each direction and there's no exits, nothing built along it. And we get closer and closer and closer and I still cannot see what's going on. I'm just like, what, what could this be? And we get a little closer and I see, okay, it looks like I'm in the left lane and then there's a median between the eastbound and westbound routes and I'm going east. And I can see that there's something over in the median to my left and it looks, as I get closer, like an animal. And I get closer and it looks like a fairly large animal and I'm thinking, is it a cow? Is it a moose? I mean, there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois, but it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it, so I'm getting a little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes going, why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal? I don't know if they might die, I might just want to get home. And I get closer and I can see that there's these kind of large hind legs, so it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car. And there's kind of a long tail and it's brown and it's this big hump. And I'm getting closer and closer and closer and my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching. What is this thing? I don't, it's not a cow. It's not a deer. It's too big to be a dog. And I'm literally, as I'm passing it, my head is, you know, we're just creeping along, my head is sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view. And it's only till it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that my mind kind of pattern matches and goes, it's a kangaroo. You know, again, I have to turn around and look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me. And I spent like the next five miles going, there's no way it was a kangaroo. And then go, but it wasn't anything else. It was a kangaroo. It was clearly a kangaroo. I saw the ears. I saw the big massive tail. I saw the big hind legs. I saw little tiny front legs. It was a kangaroo. And so to this day, it's this thing where I just don't know. I just don't, I am so certain and so uncertain that it must've been a kangaroo. And I've even, I mean, this was, okay, so this was the winter of 2000, 2001. So the internet was a thing, but it's not like, Google was around, but there weren't really, if you didn't know how to search."}, {"filename": "wright46a_240440_472185.wav", "transcript": "So this hit in the same spot, one, two, three, four, and I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any energies, but at the same time during basic training, I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle, and their discretion chose to take me to the hospital, and they're my drill sergeants, so I let them do that, instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle, and finally they got, well, upset with that and told me to stop. Well, I immediately went into shock, and being in basic training, there is much suggestion to do as one is told in a myriad manner of forms, directly and indirectly, so my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through. I actually had to walk the next morning to the clinic on a very, very swollen calf, so swollen, in fact, that I was unable to take the BDUs, which are the battle dress uniform, which have a very, very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants, from being able to be lifted up to my knee. My calf was so swollen. Unfortunately, that was the major holiday of that whole fort combination of its anniversary and Fourth of July, so the crew at the clinic on that Saturday, which then being a Saturday, buses never ran, so I had to walk about two and a half miles on that condition, did a very cursory and less than effective look at my injury and described me as, rather than having traumatic shock, as just needing only soft shoe without crutches. The next, without any shock, and just giving me mild anti-inflammatories, the next day, because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity, my battery was given KP duty, and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing KP because everyone else had been working, and I had just gotten on to a sick leave myself. I was in shock continually this entire time, so I never volunteered for any of the KP duties and was therefore given the worst one, which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very, very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee. Regardless to say, as I got back on Monday, the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very, very traumatic problems in my symptoms. Pretty much, I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies, but it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic dysfunction within my calf and knee itself.

The father remarried, and the stepmother had two daughters, maybe three. And Cinderella came to live with them to make one family out of two when the husband remarried. Well, it wasn't working too well. The stepdaughters and stepmother did not like Cinderella, and they treated her like a maid. She had to do all the work. And one day, a letter came in the mail. Announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom so that the prince could find a suitable wife. Well, you can imagine how much excitement this called. And the stepdaughter started thinking about, what will I wear, and preparing the clothes for this occasion. And Cinderella went up and found a dress in a chest that held her belongings. And she came down and was starting to work on making this dress fit her. And the stepdaughters looked at her and they said, well, you're not going. You're not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the prince's wife. And they even tore the scarf off of her dress, the waistband. And it was bad, and it made Cinderella very, very sad. And she didn't know what to do. But she went outside and was crying, and a fairy appeared to her. And it turned out to be her fairy godmother that she hadn't known anything about. And the godmother said, well, don't worry. I'll arrange for you to get to the ball. So the day of the ball came, and the stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy horse and carriage. And the godmother did her magic. She turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage. She turned mice into horses. And she used her magic powers and her wand to dress Cinderella in a beautiful ball ground. And she saw that Cinderella got into the carriage and went off to the ball. Her only admonition was, you must be home by midnight. Cinderella entered the ballroom, and everyone turned to look at her because of her beauty and her graciousness. The prince noticed her, danced with her, fell in love with her. And Cinderella was having such a good time, she didn't think a thing about time.

She fled so quickly that she lost one of her glass slippers and root. And she fled back to her carriage and was taken home to the barnyard. And the reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight or else the spell would wear off and her true identity would be revealed. So for days afterwards, Cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience, but also saddened by her lot in life and the fact that it was such a short-lived pleasure. But one day a knock came on the door and it was a court magistrate from the prince who had this slipper and was going around the households trying to find this special lost woman. And he knew if the shoe fit, he'd identify this mysterious guest. And the shoe fit for Cinderella. So with that, she was whisked away and rescued from the arms of her diabolical relatives and brought to the prince and they married and lived happily ever after. All right, now we'll move on to something a little different. Will you please tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? That's exactly what we did the last time. It is. Okay. So you'll need to go to the fridge and take out your loaf of bread. You'll take two slices and put them on a plate face up and you'll remove your peanut butter from the fridge and also your jelly. You'll extract a couple of knives from your silverware drawer. You'll use one knife to spread the peanut butter on one of these face up slices of bread. You'll have to open the jar first, but once you've opened the jar, you'll have to stick the knife in and spread the peanut butter on. And enough to cover the bread kind of with a bit of abundance. So none of the bread shows through. Then you'll take the other knife, you'll open the other can, which is of the jam and you'll put the knife in and spread the other slice of bread with this jelly.

And then she grows up and she becomes the servant girl of the house. She cooks for them and cleans for them, and her only friends are the animals, which she talks to. And one day in the kingdom the king basically says his son needs to get married. He wants all of the eligible bachelorettes, I guess, in the kingdom to come to the spa. So he comes around giving invitations to all the families and the evil stepmother gets the invitations reading it and her two daughters are really excited and Cinderella wants to go. She goes up and she goes into a trunk. I think it was like her mother's clothes or something like that. She finds this old gown and I know all of her little bird friends and stuff help her put together this really beautiful outfit. So later when the ball comes around, everyone's ready to go. Her stepsisters are ready and she comes down and they basically tear up her dress and they say she's not allowed to go. In some versions they give her a lot of chores to do. They basically make it so she can't go. She goes outside and she's really upset and her fake godmother appears."}, {"filename": "NEURAL2-2_1724844_1955978.wav", "transcript": "And then, so she's upset, her dress is torn. She goes outside and she's crying. And then there's this nice older woman who has a special wand and says, oh dear, I'm going to take care of it for you. And then poof, she waves her wand and then turns a pumpkin into a carriage and her mice and dog friends into footmen and horses. And then the next problem was that she didn't have anything to wear. So then she waves her wand and miraculously she's got a cool hairdo. She's got her hair's all done up. She's wearing a beautiful white dress and glass slippers. So off she goes to the ball, she gets to the ball. She looks so amazing that no one knew who she was. And of course the prince was like, oh, you're so wonderful. And so then the prince can't take his eyes off of her, dances with her all night until the clock starts to strike 12. So then she remembers something that the fairy, the older woman, the fairy godmother had said, you have to get home before the last strike of 12 at midnight. So she runs out of the castle because she doesn't want anyone to know her true identity. And she goes running down the stairs. And as she's fleeing the scene, she loses one of her glass slippers. And one of the servants of the princes runs and picks it up. But it's too late, she's already gone. And on the way home, the pumpkin turned back into a pumpkin and the dog turned back into a dog, et cetera, et cetera. But she goes home and she's got these happy memories of being in the prince's arms. And I think that her family, family slash mother-in-law captor, or not mother-in-law, yeah, stepmother. I don't think that they knew that she was the one. I think they had no idea. But for some reason, she was locked inside of her room because I remember the key, that the mice had used the key to let her out. So I don't remember why, but she was locked in her room. And at any rate, so the prince desperately wanted to find this beautiful young woman that he danced with. So they send out one of their servants to go out and try to find this woman by having all of them try on this class slipper. Of course, it's not fitting. It's not fitting. Ironically, that no women seem to have a foot that fits into these. I don't understand why. Does she have like such tiny feet? I don't get it. But at any rate, yeah, that doesn't seem to work. And then somehow because of the mice opening the door, she's had been locked upstairs in some sort of a tower. I don't know what it was. And then she's freed and she comes down and she tries on the glass slipper and it is discovered that yes, indeed, she was the one that was dancing with the prince. And everybody's like, oh, and then she gets sent off to go with the king or the prince and live happily ever after. And what happens with the stepmother and the stepdaughters, I do not know, but perhaps karma decided that, I don't know. I think that's the end of the story."}, {"filename": "capilouto53a_647080_877999.wav", "transcript": "Well, in 1941, I joined the Navy just after I got out of high school.

And then my first trip to sea, I was still 17, and I returned 18 a couple of days out. But I found that I was on the armed guard service. And during a big war, merchant ships are outfitted with guns, and the Navy puts a few people on there to man the guns. And then they go to all kinds of strange ports. And they often travel in convoys, so they needed a train signalman on there. And that was why I went to the communication school. And then the second ship I was on, I was in New Orleans, having gone through the canal, Panama Canal. And I was at the old days, you had to go to a movie, and they would have the news, you know, before the television. And there was this ship, a liberty ship. It was made by Samuel Gompers, who was the head of the AFL, American Federation of Labor. And they had built it on Labor Day in 1942. And I saw it on the movie tone. And later I was assigned to that ship. And we went to Auckland, New Zealand, 20 days, 21 days, and then Wellington, and then over to Sydney. And then we went up less than 100 miles up to Newcastle and took on a load of coal. And we went to New Caledonia and then unloaded the coal and then went up to the north end of the island and took on a load of nickel ore. And then we went back to Noumea.

Father meant well, but the stepmother, or the woman to whom she was brought, and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully. She became their maid, essentially, and had to clean the house, take care of the fireplace, hence the name Cinderella, do the cooking, do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to please themselves. Because one day the prince, they lived in a principality, the prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to, or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the, or all of the single women in the principality would be invited. And the idea would be that he would, the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife. The three, Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball, the mother, their mother is very excited, and of course Cinderella is excluded, she cannot go to the ball. And so she's left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball. She's visited by her fairy godmother, who grants her her wish of attending the ball. Of course Cinderella says, how am I going to get there, what am I going to wear? So the fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her out of magic, takes a pumpkin, causes it to become a coach, mice become the horses, I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman, so I forget which animal becomes the coachman. They take her to the ball. She's not really recognized by her stepsisters and the stepmother. But the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight, otherwise at midnight everything would turn back to what it was, the coach would become the pumpkin again, etc. So she promises to return at midnight, but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight, so she panics, rightly so, runs, gets back in the coach and is taken home. But one of her slippers, glass slippers, that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her, is left behind and the prince at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to know who she was, because she was going to be the one. And the only thing he had to go on was the slipper that she left behind. So he has all of the young ladies in the municipality try the slipper on. It's brought to each of their houses. And of course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for, the one who was at the ball. And sure enough, it is Cinderella's foot that fits the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother, but to her great delight.

I was stationed at England Air Force Base in Alexandria, Louisiana, and we were then flying, I was a fighter pilot, we were then flying the swept wing version of the F-84, known as the F-84F, and we were, we had been out or on a, you know, series of missions, and we were just returning to the base. Well, actually, I was by myself. I was flying solo, not in formation with anybody. It was, it was just a, just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane, and also proficiency, just practice, practice this, practice that. Well, in those times, we, we had a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at 340 knots airspeed. When directly over the air, when we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back, tilt the airplane onto a wing, and suck back on the stick in a very tight 180-degree turn in order to dissipate airspeed sufficiently that it would be safe to drop the, the landing gear, the flaps, and the speed brakes, which it did. And that was called the downwind leg at 180 degrees. After that, the airplane is slow enough so that we would, we would have not have touched the throttle, in other words, cut power completely, and just bring it on around to the, you know, to a full 360-degree turn, and then land on the runway. Well, the legs of the pattern are called the approach, 180 degrees the downwind, 90 degrees from that is the base, and following that is the final. So it's just, you're actually flying in a circle. Well, here I am on the base leg with no power. All the garbage is out. We call it garbage. The speed brakes, the flaps, and the landing gear. And all of a sudden, I'm about, I don't know, three, four hundred feet off the ground. No, more than that, maybe five, six, seven, eight hundred feet, something like that. I'm not really sure. The airplane started to shudder. A shuddering is the sign of a stall. That means the, when an airplane stalls, it means it's falling out of the sky. And I knew immediately, people do not survive these, a situation like this. And yet, I automatically didn't even, I almost didn't have time to think, but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of records off the end of the runway. I didn't want that to happen. Well, what did I do? I gave it full power, which did not catch in time.

And I shouldn't say pain, it's like I couldn't hold up my head. I was tired all the time. And I noticed, other people noticed that I was always sitting in pictures with my hands on my cheek or my hand under my chin. You know, and they laughed at me. They said, oh, you're just trying to get rid of your double chin. And then I said to my doctor, I said, that it seemed to be a problem because I was losing some feeling in my hand. And he said, well, it could be something with your neck too. And so I said, well, all I can tell you is all my friends make fun of me because if you look at all my pictures, I'm sitting with my hand on my face or under my chin or something like that. I said, it's just like my head's too tired to hold up my neck anymore. So then they did an MRI and they said, oh yeah, good thing you tried to say something. Then I did 140 steroid shots over a year and I gained 50 pounds and I looked like a balloon. And I was not addicted, but I lived on oxycodone because the pain was just so tremendously bad. And then I finally went and got a second opinion from a neurosurgeon who said, we're scheduling your surgery for this week. You're lucky you didn't lose the use of your right hand because there's almost nothing left of your nerve over there. So then they scheduled me, they cut open my neck, moved everything to the side, put some titanium rods in there and went through some physical therapy. And I was off work for three months and I couldn't drive and I couldn't run the vacuum even though I felt great, I wasn't allowed to. So I relied on a lot of people to keep me from going insane being in the house for three months until they took me out and did things. And then I just rehabbed it and got better and just the support of everybody around me. And even my spouse saying, no, you're not gonna run the vacuum, I'm gonna run the vacuum. No, you're not gonna get the milk, I'll get the milk for the kids. So just having him be very supportive and friends and family stopped by. And my situation, it worked out great.

And that's kind of a broad topic, any type of difficulty communicating. And if you can think of someone. Someone that's a little stronger will deny. Okay, so this is a good choice. So what I'd like for you to do is kind of tell me what problems there are with communicating with this person and what you did or do about it. Just the problem being no matter what I say, it's not right. But if somebody else says the same thing, then it's accepted differently.

When I had the initial operation, that was before the days of scopes, arthroscopes. So my first one was what I call slice and dice. They cut it and took the pieces out. The next two were scopes and then nose. The way the scope went, the second one, they were able to get some additional pieces that had fallen out. The third one, they were looking around at the knee. And I remember distinctly the doctor saying, oh, what was that? And he moved the scope a little bit and saw a piece of meniscus floating by the scope. And he says, oh, we must have missed this on the last surgery. So that was that. So after that, I was still relatively young, but it got to the point where I started getting pains. Once I was 55-ish, started getting pain, I went to an orthopedic surgeon. He worked with me for several years, did injections, trying to take care of lubing the knee so it would be okay. And eventually those lubrications did not work, so that's when they went in for the total knee replacement. Since then, I've had lots of fun. I've actually been back to a different surgeon because we found out through going to a different surgeon that the appliance that they used in my knee was one version. And the guy that I went to said, wonder why they used that one. And what they found was my PCL, which holds one part of my knee to the other part of my knee, was basically, he used the word mangled. So it had been stretched out and twisted so much that my knee would pop out of place. And he gave me two options. One was surgery, and that changed the appliance. I'd have to do another total knee replacement and put in a new appliance, or go rehab. So I did rehab. I actually did a unique kind of rehab. I used a personal trainer, and they were able to send him the information about my injury. So he was able to work with me, knowing what the problem was. He worked with me to get to the point where I was in very good shape on the knee. I still have problems, but most of the way I've been recovering. Our next prompt, we can move on here. Have you ever had an experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? I have had a case where I was working with a person that was doing a network evaluation. It's what I used to do. And the gentleman that I was working with had an extremely heavy Indian accent. And the Indian accent with the British wording made some of the times that it was hard to catch what he was saying.

And so just pretend like I've never made one before, I don't know how to make it, so if you just tell me how to make the sandwich. Okay. I guess you would get a plate and two slices of bread, and get out the peanut butter and jelly and a knife, and use the knife to get the peanut butter and put it on one side, on one slice of bread, and then use the knife to get the jelly and put it on the other slice of bread, put them together, and eat the sandwich."}, {"filename": "UNH1054_610_230237.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so soccer is played primarily with the feet. There's a ball that two teams of 11 people each vie for control of. Yeah, so I think of those 11, one is a goalie. Each team has a goalkeeper and a goal on a pitch of grass about the size of a football field maybe. Yeah, so like 300 feet length-wise, maybe like 150 feet width-wise. So that comprises the boundaries of the playing field, the playing space, and the 11 players, including the goalie, comprise halves of the playing space. So that playing space is cut in half. There's 11 on one side, 11 on the other, and then at halftime, the sides are switched. But the way it starts is a coin is flipped and whoever wins the coin toss, that team will start kicking the ball to its teammates from the center of the field. So what happens is it's 11 on 11. There are different lines of that 11, the way it's ordered on the field. The people in the front of that group of 11, their main task is to score on the opposing goal. The ones behind them are kind of defense and offense. They can score, but their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score. The people behind them, it's usually three or four, are like the last line of defense. They're called defenders and they keep the ball far away from the goalie if they can. And the goalie is the absolute last line of defense kind of guarding the goal and keeping the ball from going into the goal. The major rules is that the only person that can use their hands, except on out-of-bounds throws, are the goalies. The goalies can use their hands at any time, but any of the players, if they ever touch the ball, that's a penalty with their hand. They're just moving the ball by doing what's called dribbling or passing with their feet. Scoring happens when the opposing team kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net, into the netted goal. And they can do that through what's called a penalty kick, a corner kick, or just regular gameplay kick into the goal. The duration, the contest will last 70 to 90 minutes. And the teams that do the best are constantly moving the ball in triangles, I think, this is my theory, where they're passing the ball to each other in triangular formations. They're spreading out in triangular formations over the playing field and giving the person with the ball like, you know, options of passage, passing of the ball to people at different points on the triangle. And you can pass backwards, you can pass forwards, you can pass across the field to open space."}, {"filename": "NEURAL40-2_278937_508414.wav", "transcript": "Um, I am quite sure I, I could, um, let's see, something important that happened would be, um, I guess, let's see, I was, hmm, how old was I, 19 years old, um, I had a full-time job and, but I was still kind of bored living at home, so I decided to take a part-time job, uh, my brother used to work at a bowling center, actually still does, been there for 40-some years, oh my goodness gracious, and anyway, so my brother Eddie, he's the one I did the kidney with, um, he goes, well, why don't you just come and do some part-time work at the bowling center, I'm like, well, okay, I will, so I did that for maybe a couple months and this guy came in, really cute, a couple years younger than me, and Eddie hired him to be the, um, the busboy, you know, clean the tables and stuff, so, um, and we all became good friends and his name was, um, Rob, well, fast forward that, um, we've now been married 35 years, so, yeah, so my, my oldest brother hired my husband to be, so. So now, I'm going to show you these pictures, uh, take a little time to look at all the pictures and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Okay, uh, let's see, one day, a boy went for a walk and, uh, he had his, um, soccer ball with him, he's on the soccer team, so he likes to practice, so he was walking and walking and decided he's just going to go and kick this ball, well, that wasn't a good idea because when he kicked it, he hit a house, uh, uh, through the window, so, unfortunately, there was someone right there in the chair who also saw the whole thing and he was not happy, so he jumped up real quick and got in the house and said, who did that? But it looked like the boy was gone, the end. Um, here are some other pictures that tell a story, I'd like you to take a look at all of them and then, um, I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Uh, one day, a little boy wanted to take a walk and it was raining and his mother said, but you can't go out unless you have an umbrella because you'll get wet, and he's like, I don't really want to, she goes, but you're going to have to if you want to go out, so he's like, I think I'm just going to go out anyway, so she didn't like that too much, so he went out in the rain and, you know what, he didn't like it so much because it was pouring and he got drenched, so he went back in the house, he was really wet, mom was not happy with him, she goes, so if you want to go back in the rain and walk, that's fine, but you have to take an umbrella this time, and he goes, yes ma'am, and he walked out with his umbrella and had a great walk in the rain. So here's a picture, I would like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see, and I'd like for you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. So, one day, a father-daughter, they were taking a walk with their cat, and while they were walking, a dog started chasing the cat, and the cat got really scared, so the cat ran up a tree. Well, then the dad got worried, he was trying to get the cat, so he was, he actually got up there, but then he got stuck, so she's trying to get the cat to come down by jumping in her arms, but that didn't work either, but thank goodness someone saw all this and called the fire department, who helped get everyone out of the tree."}, {"filename": "wright01a_10452_239910.wav", "transcript": "Well, this looks like there's going to be a little bit of a disaster. Looks like Dad's up in a tree and can't get down. He's like chasing the cat up there trying to get the cat down. Dog's barking at the bottom of the tree. This cat ain't coming down. Dad's just sitting there going, oh dear. And then it must be his daughter who's trying to catch the cat in case he does fall down. And there's Dad. Dad lost his ladder. And the firemen are coming, and they're coming with a ladder. And hopefully they get him all down and everything's okay. Subject 6007H, during event casts, directions. Well, this looks like they're out in the country with a couple, a man and a woman in a car, and they're driving. You can see a farmhouse, so it's close to farms in the country. There's a farmer by a little tree there, and he's waving at them, saying hello. They're waving back. Evidently they must be lost. The man took out a map and was asking the farmer directions or where they're at. And then the farmer's giving them directions and pointing to where and how to get where they're going. So they take off, driving down the road, and the farmer went back to digging a hole to plant the tree. So he's there alone. All of a sudden, in the middle of his digging, there's the car again and the couple again, going the same way. He looks very astounded, going, how did they get back here? This is crazy. He's probably thinking, he just looks very astounded, that what are you doing here? Subject 6007H, event cast, couples. Well, it's the inside of a house, and there's a couple fighting. Looks like she's yelling at the man. They're yelling back at each other. He's reading a newspaper. And she's got her coat on and her suitcase heading for the door. Evidently she's going to leave him. He looks all distraught, very distraught that she left. He's still sitting in the chair. And then the door opens and there she is. They look at each other. He gets up. She's crying. And he opens up his arms to welcome her home. Anyway, they're hugging at the door and everything like that. And it looks like she crashed the car. And he's looking towards the car going, wow, what happened here? That must be why she's crying, because she crashed the car.

His dad was sitting in the living room when the ball came in and hit a lamp and his father looked outside and immediately knew who did it because he was the only one standing there. Okay, so I'd like you to do the same thing. Take a look at these pictures. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. A woman told her son to carry an umbrella to school with him because it was going to rain. He said he didn't need it and he said goodbye and went to school, but on the way to school he noticed that it started raining. However, he didn't turn back to go back to his house until it started pouring. When he got home, his mother was angry because he was wet and she also said, I told you so. Then he had to change clothes and was sent back to school with the umbrella. And now I'd like you to take a look at this picture and again tell me a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. A little girl's cat saw a bird in a tree and climbed the tree to get to the bird. However, the cat got stuck in the tree and the little girl called the man over with his dog to come and get the cat out of the tree. So when he set up the ladder, his dog got excited about the cat in the tree and knocked the ladder over which prompted the little girl to call the fire department to come get the man and the cat out of the tree. So now I'm going to let you take a look through this picture book. It tells the story of Cinderella. The pictures might remind you how it goes. Just take a look at the pictures and then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. Okay. Once upon a time a man whose wife had died a long time ago and his daughter lived alone until the man met a woman with two daughters. They moved in and he was married and then he died and the stepmother of the man's daughter adopted the daughter but didn't love her as much as she loved her own children. So she made Cinderella, that's the girl's name, the maid."}, {"filename": "UMD14_313665_543012.wav", "transcript": "Well, let's see. If I remember, Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl. And a nice man took her home to his family, or somebody. And the stepmother already had daughters. And they took her in, but they treated her like a servant. And she did all the cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff. And she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear. And she was usually in the kitchen cleaning. And an invitation came to the family to attend a ball, I think, in honor of Prince Charming or somebody. And the evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and be rich. And so they all got fancied up to go to the ball. And Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go, and she wanted to go, and she was crying about it. And a good fairy godmother came along. I'm not quite sure how she got there. And she was able to turn ordinary things and creatures around her into fabulous ones. And she turned a pumpkin into a coach, and old mags into beautiful horses, and she turned the mice into something. Anyway, and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers, and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left. And when she came in, the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her. And they danced the night away, and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry. Then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning. And so she had to be sure to leave by midnight. And she was a little late, and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach, and she lost a glass slipper. And the prince picked it up and was calling out to her, I think. And she jumped in the coach, and they ran away from the ball. And it turned back into a pumpkin, and her clothes turned back into rags, and she had one glass slipper on her foot. And then the prince was very sad."}, {"filename": "NEURAL38-2_7761_236756.wav", "transcript": "Since you have not had a stroke, I wonder if you could tell me what you remember about any illness or injury that you've had. Ah, I think I probably already told the story of the elbow. The previous, what else have I ever had? Ah, there's the thumb. Which one is it? Ah, it's that one. It was that thumb. That was when I worked at Fermilab in Chicago for a couple of years. And I lived in a area called West Chicago and had a motorcycle I bought when I was living in Bloomington after I'd graduated with a geology degree, but didn't want to leave. Well, I didn't leave town until I got the job at Fermilab because I kind of, to do something, I was working for the university physical plant doing sheet metal and roofing stuff and wasn't getting paid much, but it was enough to buy a Kawasaki H1 500cc two-stroke three-cylinder motorcycle, which was very fast, but handled really badly. And you have to be really careful. But the only real wreck I ever got into, I was in Chicago and I was going home from Fermilab back to the house I lived in, sort of in the country between DuPage County Airport and the little town of West Chicago. And as I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and the bike started vibrating really badly. I didn't recognize it because I'd had back tires go low before, but never had a front tire go low before. So all I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder, front brake and push the rear brake. And since the front tire had gotten really low, it just suddenly like down into the street and tossed me into the ditch. I got up out of the ditch and well, there are two problems. One is that back then I wasn't very good at wearing protective safety gear. So I was riding a motorcycle without a shirt, even I didn't have pants and shoes. I don't know, I don't remember I was shirt. So I had gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder, that I hit with the shoulder. But the other problem was this thumb was just kind of dangling, like it wasn't connected anywhere because it wasn't, this bone here was just broken and clear off. So this was really too many years ago to remember. It's 1979, but I think some of the neighbors are driving into the same gravel drive I lived in and helped me roll the motorcycle kind of up the little hill a little bit and parked the motorcycle. And then I, maybe they gave me a ride home, I don't know. I just remember getting into my car. Even then I had two cars. So one of the cars that would get to the DuPage County hospital and went to emergency room, they looked it over and they bandaged it up and made me appointment to come back. And on Monday, it was Friday probably. I went back Friday."}, {"filename": "capilouto10a_441776_670346.wav", "transcript": "Well, more recently, I guess the whole world has suffered this, what do you want to call it, crisis, recession, depression, whatever it may be, the financial end of it, on paper only. I guess I've lost maybe $100,000. But as long as you don't sell nothing, you haven't lost it, if you understand what I'm saying. That's where a lot of people, and I don't understand the business world, telling these people, especially the mutual fund brokers and that, telling people to cash their stuff in and go to a mutual fund. Well, to me, that's absolutely ridiculous. As an example, I've got a lot of Procter & Gamble. And it was up, oh, last summer, I guess, around $74 a share. Right now, it's about $48 or $49. Now, to tell somebody to sell that and take a $30, $35 share loss, it's kind of ridiculous to me. But now, I guess that's the way these agents make their money, by talking the public into relinquishing what they've got that's good. Now, I don't say you should keep all your stocks. But you give them a blue chip, then I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive shares. As a matter of fact, just last Friday, I went out and bought 1,000 shares of Ford. And also, I bought 1,000 shares of AK Steel. Now, really, being retired, I can watch a lot of television, as I said earlier. And I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday, when you get a lot of diversified opinions. And to sell the automobiles out, it doesn't make sense. But now, on AK Steel, that's the same way. They were $74 a share. And now, I put a bid in for $6 a share. And I'm pretty cool. It was $576 when I started playing phone tag with the broker. So like I said, last Friday, I went to Fifth Third, met a broker there, and we put in a buy for it. Now, if you don't understand what a buy means, it was selling for $621. Well, I said, when it goes down to $6, buy me 1,000 shares of it. And my reason for doing that is Obama wants to improve all the infrastructure. Infrastructure means steel. And that's where AK Steel comes in. And although they haven't completed, through Congress, what they wanted to do, what they're trying to say, buy American, I really don't believe in that. But it's really going to push the American steel up. And all American industries are going to start making recovers. But it was funny, I just listened this morning on television before I'd come down here. And the state of Kentucky is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States. They're trying to pass that right now. So that's, to me, that was the most interesting thing to me. And the worst thing was losing all that money at my age. Of course, I don't have to sell anything, and I'm not going to sell it. And maybe my heirs will, and my wife will. But hopefully, by the end, if I live that long, it'll go back up again."}, {"filename": "wright42a_238533_467016.wav", "transcript": "In my case, I think I went over 200, and I remember my, it felt like the back of my head was going to explode, you know, at the base of my skull, just from so much pressure, and I'd never passed out in my life. I'd been knocked out once, you know, playing football, but I never passed out, and I knew I was going to pass out, and I told the doctor that, and she said, okay, lay back. So I looked at her and said, I can't, I can't, I don't dare. So she put her hands behind me and laid me back, and at that point, I don't know what was going on externally, but internally, I was fishing with my grandfather, and he was, it was at a favorite fishing place that I had when I was growing up, and he was walking up the stream bank wanting to continue fishing, and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him, and I said, I want to go, I want to go. It's not your time to go fishing with me, go home. So I woke up and later was told that, I can recall, actually, I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not, but I actually remember having an out-of-body experience where I was, like, looking at myself and looking at the doctor and, you know, watching what they were doing, and it was like, geez, what are you doing to me? And then it hit me that, oh, yeah, they're doing it to me. My wife has to fill in the details, you know, of other stuff that happened, but apparently they brought in the crash cart and I guess, you know, zapped me at least once, and I did come back. Overall, I was out for seven minutes, not breathing for seven minutes, and to this day have had little, if any, effects, you know, after effects from that. You know, they say seven minutes, your brain is dead. Well, I have no idea why, but it didn't affect me, not. I'm sure sometimes it affects me, you know, in some of my memory, but that could be aging, too. So that is very vivid to me. The, probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee who was actually hired for me. We came in as, I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe, and needed an assistant. The assistant was brought in, and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us, we all kind of looked at each other and said, what did he just say? He's Filipino, he's, he was, I believe, born in the U.S., but he's raised Filipino, so he talks the Gaelic language, I think it is."}, {"filename": "richardson194_251116_478866.wav", "transcript": "She lived in the house and cleaned up after the step-sisters and the step-mother who had a cat named Lucifer, and she, or Cinderella, was friends with the mice and the birds and the horse and the dog that they all had in the house, or on the property.

Every eligible girl in the kingdom was invited, and then, so Cinderella made her dress out of the sash and necklaces and stuff that she borrowed from her step-sisters. But when she came down the night of the ball, her step-sisters took it all back and ruined her dress, and then the step-mother gave her a list of chores to do before she could go to the ball. But of course, they took forever, so she didn't think she was going to be able to go, so she was crying, and then her fairy step-mother, godmother, fairy godmother, came to, and came and gave her, or created her a dress, and a coach, and a bunch of horses, and like a little groomsman guy who tells the horses where to go, and glass slippers, and said she had until midnight. So she went to the ball, and the step-sisters didn't know who she was, but she danced with the prince all night, and right as the clock struck midnight, she was running away, and her shoe fell off on the steps, and he kept it.

Okay, great. And so I just have one more thing. It's a little different. I would like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. First, you have to gather two slices of bread, a knife, and a spoon, and a plate, a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of jelly. You take one slice of bread, and you put peanut butter on one side using the knife, and you set that down and pick up the next slice of bread, and you put jelly on a single side with the spoon, then you take the two pieces of bread with the peanut butter and the jelly on the inside, and you put them together, and you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."}, {"filename": "wright92a_912998_1140555.wav", "transcript": "It's about the Cinderella story.

So they continue on with their life and the little girl's life, Cinderella brings tea to her sisters and they're not very happy with her. So the little Cinderella goes outside in the barn, outside with the animals and she has a nice life because of the animals, because she can talk to the animals and she knows that the animals love her and she loves them. She does not feel that her parents and her stepmother and sisters don't love her.

So the little mice make her up a dress, she looks in a book and she reads the book to see how to sew the dress and the four little mice help her make a dress. Well the stepsisters realize that the sister thinks that Cinderella is going to the ball as well and they take her dress and they rip it up and tell her she will not be going to the ball.

And after a minimal amount of medical intervention, not much, we decided to sign up with an adoption agency. And we had talked about this before we got married that we thought we would like to have a family and maybe it might be nice to adopt children. So now we had this opportunity. So we signed up with the adoption agency. And after we had completed all of the paperwork, they said, now you can wait. And it might be a long time. But this was in 1968 when it was easy to get a child, not like it is now. And five months into the procedure, I got a call one day from our social worker who said, are you sitting down? And I said, no, but I will. And she said, we have a baby for you. We have a little girl. Can you come and get her tomorrow? Yes, we can. Ted and I had been in the process of setting up the nursery and now he worked until two o'clock in the morning to finish painting and finish the crib. And so we got to our 10 o'clock appointment. The next morning was in October. I still remember how beautiful the golden cottonwood leaves were on the trees. This was in Denver, Colorado. And we were invited to come into the agency and we filled out some papers. And then, then, then we were ushered into the little nursery. And there in a little white crib, wearing a tiny little pink dress with little white flowers, lay our baby. We signed more paperwork, picked her up, loved her and took her home and have been living happily ever since. Four years later, we adopted another child.

So he goes, okay, yeah, I guess in picture two it looks like he's, uh, he's happy and the mom's angry, but I guess he's just saying, uh, whatever mom, it doesn't matter. I'll be fine. And then she's being real angry with him and, uh, he goes outside, figures out he really doesn't want the umbrella. He comes back in. The mom gives him the, I told you so, look stripping wet. And then he decides to take the umbrella after all."}, {"filename": "wright62a_946465_1172129.wav", "transcript": "I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone. Well, with low RPM, there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes, so they remained extended. What happened then is that I brought the airplane down, I overshot the runway, but I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway, off to one side. The F-84F has a yaw characteristic at full stall, which means that the nose will turn 30 or 40 degrees, either to the left or to the right, you can't predict it, but it will do that. Later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe, because it's a jet. And you could also see where the grass was carried forward by contacting with the tail as it came in tail low. Well, pretty soon, there came the ground. In retrospect, I can remember very well that the horizon was jumping up and down, and the airplane did yaw, but it still kept going in the same direction. It yawed, and as I say, I remember the horizon bouncing up and down, but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on. Well, eventually it did come to rest. It had yawed to the right so that at full power, the engine was\u2014or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway, which is frequently in place\u2014which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up. Well, they about panicked, at which I followed the proper procedures. I cut all power, turned everything off, and with my parachute still trapped on me, I think I may well have set a record for the 50-yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing. I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again. All they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground. They towed it back in to the hangar on its own wheels. It did fly again, and so did I, of course. But in this moment of panic, it was only a quick flash. The thought was, I know what I need to do, but people don't walk away from these things. I walked away. It was later determined that while I was indicating the proper airspeed on my initial approach of 340 knots, one of my buddies was in back of me, also alone. His testimony was that he was indicating 320 knots, which is 20 knots slower than I was indicating, but he could tell that he was overtaking me. So obviously, it was an airspeed."}, {"filename": "wright100a_207121_432481.wav", "transcript": "Yeah, I try to just be patient and continually try to open those doors of communication.

So there's a little boy playing soccer outside, trying to learn how to kick the ball better, and he still hasn't quite learned, so as he kicks the ball, it goes through the window into the house, and there's a man sitting inside, probably his dad, who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened. So there is a little boy getting ready for school, and his mom comes up and says, don't you want to take your umbrella? And he says no, he's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself, so he doesn't want to take his mother's good advice. He goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining, raining very, very hard, there are puddles everywhere, it's really uncomfortable to be that wet. So he runs home, totally drenched, to get the umbrella from his mother, and then walks out and feels a lot better, because now he has some weather protection. So there is a little girl whose mother has died, and so her father meets someone else who wants to have a new mother for her, so she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters, she's excited, but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean, and the stepmother is very cruel, so all the years as she's raised with them, during the beginning few years, it's okay, it's not great, and then her father dies and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters, and they basically make her to be a maid. They're never very kind to her, and she has to do all the work on the farm, and she has to work with all the animals, and basically serve them all their food. So there's also, in this same area, a castle, and a prince, and a king that live all the way in the castle, and the king is getting very antsy, and wants to find a bride for his son, the prince, so he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region, so an invitation for a ball, so that the prince can choose a bride, and they get this invitation at Cinderella's house, the stepmother reads it, and the ugly, mean stepsisters are very excited, they want to go meet this handsome prince, and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess. So they get ready for the ball, and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball, she wants to go dance and have fun, so she hangs out with all her little animal friends, and is up all night with her little mice friends, making this beautiful dress for the ball, and when she goes out and is about to leave, her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go, she's not going to go, they rip off all of her jewelry, they tear apart her dress, and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave, and the wicked stepmother goes as well. So Cinderella is very sad, she doesn't know what to do, and then her fairy godmother appears, and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball, and fulfill her destiny."}, {"filename": "wright85a_340_225110.wav", "transcript": "depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crust or not you butter the bread in my opinion then you put on peanut butter and then you put on the jam and uh... then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top and cut it in any way so desired all righty we have a man stranded in a tree because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat because a little girl was crying because the cat was up in the tree and uh... after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down a dog came along and was barking up the tree and the fireman come with a ladder to rescue the man and I'm assuming everything ends up okay the end well the most recent episode is a broken bone but it was it's not a big deal I uh... had been having pain in my left foot the more I walked the more it hurt but I really just kind of ignored it I was more concerned about my right foot with the toenail looking like it was lifting off the bed and I didn't quite know what to do about this so I made a appointment with the foot doctor but my foot doctor is in Waukegan Illinois and uh... let's see how did that work we came we came directly from we had been on a a cruise and we had visited our children in in Orlando and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan so I could see the foot doctor and uh... man I don't remember what happened but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor uh... she just explained that the reason the nail was lifting off was because when she had removed the ingrown toenail a new nail was growing underneath so she just took the top nail off took half a minute that was done and then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting and so of course she feeling it and found a very painful spot and that led to x-rays which showed there was a small broken bone and which led to my having to wear a boot for a month and then come back for more x-rays so I came back to Arizona then I turned around and a month went back to Waukegan for more x-rays and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is usual for me because this whole scenario happened once before and uh... she says another month with the boot and to do ultrasound treatments every day and I forgot to do it no I did it yesterday and uh... she also told me that when I came back when I would be coming back at the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else and of course she's following him and nice thing about the visit is I really like that foot doctor as a person and she's pregnant and she's going to have her second child and I thought that was real nice but anyway I said well since you're not going to be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona so that's where I am now I'm waiting for this stupid foot to heal the end"}, {"filename": "wright01a_1937461_2161971.wav", "transcript": "It looks like she looks like a young child, I don't know, not young yet, but she's stuck in the water, it looks like after a flood.

Poor Cinderella, who somehow or another became an orphan and had to live with her stepmother and her two ugly stepsisters, who were very mean to poor Cinderella and made her wash the dishes and scrub the floor and do all the work.

There's also this prince who lived in the castle close by, who was going to be having a, not a prom, but a dance. And there's poor Cinderella walking away. And anyway, so the prince sent out this invite to the family, to the mother, to invite them to this gala. And they were so pleased and they were all excited and the two ugly sisters and this ugly, mean, old, evil stepmother. And they were all talking about how they were going to get dressed and what they were going to wear. And poor Cinderella says, well, can I go? And the stepmother said, well, no, no, you can't go. You know, you can't go. You have nothing to wear. And then poor Cinderella thought, well, yeah, well, you do have something to wear. I could maybe make something, you know. I'll show them that I can have something to wear. And anyway, Cinderella was surrounded by all these friends, these birds and animals in the forest that really loved Cinderella. And it was the night of the ball. Cinderella's looking out of the castle and trying on a dress that the animals had helped her make. And the ugly stepsisters learned that she was going and they tore apart her dress and said she was not supposed to go and that she can't go. And then the two sisters and the stepmother went off and left poor Cinderella all alone. Poor Cinderella was crying and weeping because she really wanted to go. And all these other animals, all her friends were as despondent as she was. And all of a sudden, as she was crying, all of a sudden there was this very, this sparkling dust and it was a fairy, Cinderella's fairy godmother who said to Cinderella, Cinderella, if you really want to go to the ball, I'll give you your wish. And she turned a pumpkin into a stagecoach and the mice into these lovely horses that would pull the stagecoach and with horsemen with livery and gave Cinderella this beautiful, beautiful gown and said to Cinderella, you can go off to the ball. And so off she went, thanking her fairy godmother, off she went to this wonderful, wonderful ball that was being held up at the castle. And the king or the Duke or whoever he was saw Cinderella and thought, ooh, I don't know who that is.

So he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived and they took the girl in and turned out they really didn't treat her like a regular family member, that this girl had to do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got everything they wanted and she was sort of like their maid and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a lot of time among the cinders by the fireplace. And in the town, it came to pass that there was going to be a ball and all the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball. So when they got the announcement, Cinderella knew about it but of course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball but she was going to make sure her daughters could go to the ball. So in preparation for the ball, as the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things, Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house and then they saw how sad she was and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such but Cinderella, I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball. So as the day became closer, the stepsisters were getting ready to go and they had beautiful dresses and she had to help mend them and let's see what happened. She I guess she went out in the garden and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad and she was crying and she really wanted to go to the ball and her fairy godmother had said, you know, you may go to the ball, she changed her frock into a beautiful dress and she said fetch me a pumpkin and turned it into a coach and the three mice came and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin and so she was able to go off to this ball and when she got there, the ball was in full swing and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the prince and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people and one had a tick and a creaky knee and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just things that they just didn't know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way. And then when Cinderella came, all eyes turned to her and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince and there was this magical thing that happened that we like to think is love and they were dancing and what not and really connecting and suddenly the clock struck twelve and she realized she had to go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight and with that she ran away and in doing so, her glass slipper remained behind. She made her way home. She was a little sad because I guess she thought she'd never see this prince again and then the prince found the slipper and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper so he and his coachmen, whoever they are, went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on and they did come to the home where Cinderella lived and the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot, wasn't going to fit and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe and it fits and they get married and live happily ever after and that was not the best version of the story I've ever heard."}, {"filename": "NEURAL5-1_723274_946995.wav", "transcript": "One day, Elliot was playing soccer. By himself, he was practicing his soccer moves. He kicked the soccer ball accidentally so hard, so high, that it went right into his neighbor Ralph's window. Broke the window, went inside Ralph's house, knocked over the lamp that Ralph was sitting next to. So Ralph got up with the ball. He walked over to the window. He looked outside. Well, there he saw Elliot. Elliot had an embarrassed, embarrassed look on his face and his head hung low. And Ralph remembered the time when he was little and he had hit a baseball into his neighbor's yard and how embarrassed he felt. So rather than going outside and yelling at Elliot, Ralph went outside and he said, you know what, I did the same thing one day. Let's figure out how we can fix it together. And they did. So here is a series of pictures. Take a look at all of them. And then I'm gonna ask you to tell me the story with the beginning, a middle and an end. Again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Ben and he was getting ready to go to school. His mother said, Ben, it's gonna rain today. You need to take the umbrella. And he said, nope, I don't, I don't need an umbrella. She said, Ben, you need to take the umbrella. He said, nope, I'm gonna go without it, bye. So he started walking to school. And as he walked to school, it started raining a little bit but he got to school, it was okay. But at the end of the day, he was walking home. It had been raining all day long. It was still raining. So on his way home, he was walking through puddles, getting poured on. By the time he got home, he was drenched and his mother was very unhappy that he had not taken the umbrella. He said, I know you were right. So the next day when he went to school, he took the umbrella and arrived at school nice and dry. So this first picture, look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with the beginning, a middle and an end. Okay, once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a cat named Spotty. And Spotty one day went outside and climbed the tree which very much upset the little girl who had been riding her tricycle. And so she called her father and her father got out the ladder and climbed up to go get Spotty the cat. But the little girl and her father's dog, Barkie came along and Barkie knocked over the ladder. So then the father was trapped in the tree trying to get Spotty. And so the dog was barking so loudly that the, I don't know, mom was inside and she saw this happening from the window. So she called the fire department and the firefighters came using their ladder and they got both dad and Spotty down from the tree and everybody lived happily ever after."}, {"filename": "richardson206_398408_622104.wav", "transcript": "I think I would have been better if I had actually seen Cinderella. Okay, so a lady, she looked really mean, I guess that's the stepmother. She came in with two girls, some guessing they were her daughter, and a man was inviting them into his home, and he had a little girl, which is Cinderella. Then the guy disappeared. I wish I watched this movie. I'm going to say he died. He died or ran away. And the stepmother started treating her bad. They treated her like a servant. She would have to take them things. They would call and she would just have to answer to them. From the picture, she seemed really nice because it was this little grumpy cat, and the mice were trying to run from him, but she was trying to pet him and be nice and friendly. And then some guy came in. No, no, no. She was looking out of a window, and it looked like a palace, so I'm guessing she was like, You know what? I wish I didn't live this life. I wish I could live in the palace, I guess. And the guy came in, and he was inviting them somewhere because the lady, the stepmother, had a little script, and the daughters were surrounding them, and they looked happy, so I guess they were getting invited there. So I guess Cinderella got invited, too, because she started looking for a dress. And she got a pink dress, and when she was on her way out, I guess, the sisters ripped her necklace off. I guess they were being mean or jealous because she was pretty or something. But she went outside and was laying on a horse, I'm thinking that was, and she met someone. She had a wand, and she got dressed up and went to the party. And she got there and started dancing with some guy. And he must have been the prince. She was dancing with the prince. And in the background, the clock was midnight, so I guess she had a curfew and tried to run home, but on her way running down the stairs, she lost her shoe. I guess she didn't notice or was too scared to turn around, but she kept running and got to the house, and the little mice were there with a key. I guess the letter ran before anyone noticed. Got in the house. Did she get yelled at? I don't think she got yelled at. I'm not sure. But in the end, one guy was looking for the person who lost her shoe, and her sisters were trying to get on, but they didn't fit their feet. They tried it with her foot, and it worked, and I guess the prince found his princess, and they lived happily ever after."}, {"filename": "NEURAL7-1_980388_1204059.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so the slides begin with the introduction of Cinderella's father to her future, or maybe even already married then. Welcome to your new stepmom and stepsisters. They are thrilled with her. Father dies, although that's not in the slide. The sisters, the stepsisters are mean to her, she has to start cleaning, doing all the heavy lifting. In the meantime, she's befriended a bunch of animals and stares longingly for, or at the castle where the prince lives. The king is looking for a suitor for his son to take over. And invitations go out, although that's not depicted either. Cinderella enlists the animals in helping her create a dress that she can wear, which is successful, but the relentless cruelty of the stepsisters are such that they tear the dress, they make it unwearable. So she's just kind of stuck, at which point she uncovers the secret, which I think was in the book of the fairy godmother who comes, gives her horse and carriage a brand new dress. She goes on to the ball. She and the prince have a really nice time. She has to leave by midnight because everything goes back. She leaves her shoe by accident. And even though when everything else reverts back to what it was, the shoe for some reason is not causing the prince to undertake a kingdom-wide search for the owner of the shoe. They make it to Cinderella's house, at which time the stepmom and stepsisters work really hard to sabotage any attempt to have it fit anybody else's foot, but they fail. It fits on Cinderella's foot. They realize it's the same person, and she and the prince live happily ever after from that point. Ask you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How detailed do you want this? As detailed as you would like, preferably more detailed than less detailed, but the rest is up to you. I did it in elementary school one time, so it was step by step. Start with, here are the ingredients you need to have in your jar of peanut butter, in your jar of jelly. You need at least two slices of bread and a butter knife. You unscrew the cap of the peanut butter. Use the butter knife to take some of the peanut butter and put it on one side of one slice of bread. You can put it on both sides, or one side of both slices, but that's doing it wrong. So you need to put it on one side of one slice. You wipe off the blade on the clean slice, because this is where your other stuff's going to go. Then you put the lid back on the peanut butter and put it away, so you don't want to clean up later. Take the lid off the jelly. Use the same butter knife. Scoop out some of the jelly."}, {"filename": "wright78a_1670_225310.wav", "transcript": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients. That would include two slices of bread, or one slice that you would fold in half, peanut butter and jelly, with butter or margarine being optional, depending upon the individual's taste. Let's assume that you have two slices of bread. You then have to make a decision as to whether or not you're going to put butter on it, or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly. Some people prefer to put the peanut butter on the bread first because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth. So trying to satisfy as many people as possible, we're going to take a knife and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread, one slice or two, depending upon how much you want to fill the bread, and then we'll put the jelly on top of the peanut butter, put the two pieces of bread together, and you are finished after putting it on a plate and finding a napkin. A little genie came crying to her father, and she was terribly upset. She said, Minnie is up in the tree and won't come down, and I'm afraid that she'll never come down and she can't come down. Please help me. So Daddy, being the big hero type, went and got his ladder, and he climbed up the tree, and just as he stepped off the ladder, the ladder gave way and fell down. Now both Minnie the cat and Dad were up the tree, Fido the dog was barking, and they didn't know what to do, but the little girl remembered what she had learned at kindergarten. If there's a big, big problem, all you need to do is to push 9-1-1 on the telephone. So she ran in the house and pushed 9-1-1 and told the people that my Daddy is up on top of the tree and he can't come down, along with Minnie my cat. And the 9-1-1 operator said, don't worry little girl, just go out and talk to your Daddy and to your cat, and someone will be there to help right away. Well she was just out there talking for just a minute when she heard the siren, and a big fire truck pulled up in front of her house, and those wonderful firemen, who not only put out fires, but they helped kids and dads and cats and everyone, came running with a different ladder. And they put the ladder up against the tree, and Daddy was able to get to Minnie the cat and come down the ladder and everyone was safe and everyone was happy again.

She had to make the meals. She had to do everything for them. Then along came the invitation to the ball. She knew that that palace was nearby and that she thought she was gonna be invited, so she pulled out her book of how to make a gown, and she made a beautiful gown for herself, of which the sisters were not gonna allow her to attend, and they tore up her dress. So the fairy godmother decided that she would give Cinderella an opportunity to attend the ball. So I believe it was a pumpkin that turned to the coach. I believe that Gus, Gus, and friends became the horses, and she took the carriage. Oh, the fairy godmother gave her a dress as well and did her hair. Probably her nails and toes too. But she told her, you only have until midnight. So she attended the ball. The prince was gaga over her, and they danced and danced and danced until it got close to midnight.

And I think stepmom got suspicious about who that was at the ball that the prince had fallen in love with and locked her in a room. But Gus, Gus, and friends were able to get her the key. She got out. So when the palace guards came a-callin', she was able to try on the slipper, and they realized that it was her. I'll skip the part about cutting off the toes this time, and all the stuff that they did to the stepmother, the stepdaughters. So, okay. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I would get out two pieces of bread. I would get out my peanut butter, and I would get out my jelly. And yes, it does have to be strawberry jelly. And I would get my knife out of the drawer. I would spread the peanut butter on one side, trying not to tear my bread. Minor on the peanut butter, not too much. On the other side of the bread, which I think I said last week, you have to have one on one side, one on the other side. And I would spread my strawberry jelly. It is sugar-free strawberry jelly. And I would spread that on the other side. I would get my Lay's potato chips, because you cannot do peanut butter and jelly without Lay's potato chips. I would pour some on the plate. I would put some inside the sandwich. I would put one slice of bread on the other slice of bread. I would cut the sandwich into halves and enjoy."}, {"filename": "wright85a_761521_984900.wav", "transcript": "Well, of course, I know Cinderella's story. We start out with Cinderella's father remarrying to a woman who turns out to be a mean stepmother, and she has two daughters who she dotes on, and they also are mean. And a father goes off on a business trip or something or other, and he dies. He doesn't return. So Cinderella is stuck with stepmother and two mean stepsisters, and she waits on the stepsisters, and no matter what she does, it isn't right. And she looks, Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince, and I assume the king and queen live, and the prince is distressing his parents because he's getting up in age, and he hasn't married, and they're telling him he has got to marry. So they throw a big ball, and invitations are sent to every house, and stepmother and stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they're going to go to. And Cinderella gets a lovely dress out of a trunk, and the stepsisters get all dressed, and Cinderella's helping them with everything. At least in this book, she gets a dress out of the trunk, but I've never seen that before. But anyway, she helps the girls, the ladies, get dressed, and she, of course, is planning on going. But stepmother and stepsisters say, no way, you cannot go. And so they leave, and Cinderella is in tears, and she's sitting by the fireplace, and the cinders and so forth. And fairy godmother comes along and tells us, asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball. And of course, Cinderella says yes, but she hasn't got any way to go, and she was told to stay home. But fairy godmother does her magic, and Cinderella has another lovely gown. And the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses. I think it's mice and horses. And somebody turns into, I guess, what you would call a coachman. And they take Cinderella to the ball, and she's the bell of the ball. And the prince is taken with her, and they're dancing and so forth. And then all of a sudden, it's almost midnight, which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she had to be back home, because she would change back into old clothes, and the coach would disappear, and all that kind of thing. So she goes running away, and as she's running away, she drops a glass slipper. And she gets home, and then the prince and his footman are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits. And the wicked, well, I'm not sure if they were wicked, but they sure were mean, stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper, and of course, it didn't fit. And somehow, he finds that Cinderella is there, and he tries the slipper on her, and it fits. And they get married, and they live happily ever after."}, {"filename": "richardson38_18624_241601.wav", "transcript": "a young boy kicked a soccer ball. The soccer ball went through a window and landed in a man's lap who was not too happy. The man looked out the window holding the soccer ball as if he was going to either, well, most likely yell at the kid to kick it through the window. Okay, great, thank you. Have you ever heard of the story Cinderella? Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna ask you to, these pictures might help remind you of it. Take a look at the pictures and then I'm gonna take the book away and ask you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay, but you can take a look through these pictures if you'd like. Do I have to look through? I mean, you don't have to. Oh. I realize you have two daughters. Doesn't really matter. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so there was a young woman who didn't have any parents whose name was Cinderella and Cinderella had to go to live with her evil stepmother and her three not-so-nice stepsisters. And the stepsisters just weren't very nice to her and she snuck her way into a ball and while she was at the ball, she had to be back by a certain time or she was gonna turn into a pumpkin or something like that. But while she was there, she lost her glass slipper. She danced with the prince. The prince loved her, was looking for the glass slipper and eventually, in spite of her stepmother and evil stepsisters' wishes, the prince eventually found her and they looked halfway over after. Okay, great. So now moving on to something a little bit different. If I'd never made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tell me how you would make one. Okay, I would, first I'd go into my pantry and I'd get some bread. And I'd take the bread and I'd put it on the counter and I'd get the peanut butter out of the pantry also and I'd get the jelly out of the refrigerator. And I would first spread the jelly because I wouldn't want the peanut butter to get into the jelly if I spread the peanut butter first. And then I would spread the jelly on one side and I'd wipe it off by spreading whatever's left over on the other side and I'd spread the peanut butter very nice and neatly on the other side. And I'd put it together and probably put it on a paper towel and bring it over here and eat it at the table. Thank you. Okay, so now I'm gonna show you another pictures. These pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them and then I'm gonna have you tell me the story with the beginning, a middle and an end. And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story. It's the same as the other one. Okay, go ahead. So looks like the little boy is refusing an umbrella. So mom said, looks like the mom's like, you need to take an umbrella because it's gonna rain today. He said, forget it, mom. He gets outside and realizes that his mother was right. So he runs back in and he's not too happy to admit his mother's right, but reluctantly takes the umbrella and goes about his way. Okay, thank you. So now here is another story. Look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay, looks like a cat ran up a tree. A little girl realized that it was her cat. She yelled to her dad to go rescue the cat. So the dad gets out the ladder. He climbs up the tree. And when he gets to the top, the ladder falls. And as a result, the dog who loves the dad starts barking very loudly and alerts neighbors who call firemen who come and rescue the father and ultimately the cat."}, {"filename": "wright47a_2750_225515.wav", "transcript": "You take out, if I was to make it, I like peanut butter, butter, and jelly on white bread.

It's little Jonathan's seventh birthday, and he's having a birthday party. He's invited his friends and his friend's parents over to open presents and have cake, and right before everyone is supposed to arrive, the dog smells the delicious cake on the table and jumps up on the table and starts to eat the cake, and little Jonathan comes in and finds the dog eating the cake and begins to cry, and the mom gets really angry and grabs a broom to punish the dog, and the dog sees the mom with the broom, gets scared, runs under the couch, trailing, icing on the carpet after him, and all the screaming and crying going on, the birthday guests arrive at the door, and they open the door to see what's going on, and they come in the living room, and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere, and they wonder if there's still going to be a party or not. You'll probably laugh, because this is kind of a unique story. I once owned two black-tailed prairie dogs, and some friends of ours liked our prairie dogs so much that two separate friends of ours each bought a pair of prairie dogs, so we had six prairie dogs among the three groups of us, and one of them was going out of the country and needed us to watch their prairie dogs, and so we did, and one of them was a male, and he was a little aggressive, and he didn't like me very much, and so I was trying to kind of calm him, pet him, Tina could pet him, my girlfriend could pet him, no problem, but he didn't like me very much, and so I was trying to pet him, and I was rubbing his chin, and he was getting all bristled up, and I really didn't read the warning sign very much, and he bit me, and took out a good chunk of my middle finger, like opened up a, so I'm actually home alone, and I look down, and I can see, you know, some of the bone and the fat in my finger, it was a pretty good bite, and I realized, well, I should probably not, I should probably get someone to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it, and I don't always do well with the sight of my own blood, like I have no problem around other people, but I got all white faced, and had to sit down for a while, and I'm like, oh boy, what do I do, so ironically, or funny, that Tina was actually swimming at ASU at the pool here, so I had to wrap my finger, and drive just a mile or two down to ASU, and interrupt her class, and to get her to drive me to the urgent care, not the hospital, for stitches, and so I was standing there, when she came up out of the pool, you know, I'm standing there, I'm like, the prairie dog bit me, can you drive me to the urgent care, and she's like, oh,"}, {"filename": "richardson172_258524_480632.wav", "transcript": "But regardless of her condition, she was still happy and made positive to all, made outlook as positive as she can. With every animal or thing that she had around her, she created her own friend and her own world. There, soon she heard that there was going to be a wonderful ball occurring at the castle, which made her very excited and wanting and dreaming to go to it. Stepmother knew that the ball was going to be hosted by a prince because they wanted to have a better chance and they wanted to see if one of the daughters would marry into money so that they can get more money. So she was preparing her daughters as well to be ladies, to be able to go to the ball. When Cinderella asked to see if she could go to the ball, they said they were fine, but you would have to do all these chores that could not be done in a time frame and time. So as she continued to work hard to try to make her deadline, her stepmother and her sisters were able to go and made sure that they gave her more work before she left. Saddened because of the fact that she could not go, she made a wish and as she made a wish, a fairy godmother appeared to answer her plea. But there was conditions for doing this wonderful favor that she can go enjoy her night, but had to return at a certain time frame, a deadline of midnight. She was able to go to the ball with all the magic that was bestowed to her on that occasion. She was able to meet the prince, had a wonderful time and lost track of time. And when she realized her time was paying off, she had to run hastily. Prior to leaving though, her stepsisters and her stepmother were able to find out that she had joined mysteriously to the ball. As she was leaving, she accidentally left her shoe as she was trying to leave before anybody were to see her change. She got barely home, but she changed. She was still happy at the experiences that she had. Stepmother came home, saw, knew that she was able to go and saw that it was dangerous, that the prince did like her more than her stepsisters. Made sure when she heard that the royalty were coming that she would not be seen. Somehow she was able to escape so that she would be able to prove that she was the mysterious girl that they needed for the ball that the prince met. And when she put on the shoe, they found it was her. So he was happy and she was able to get out of her bad situation. Alright, excellent. And then last, for this first test, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Oh, I don't even like that. You go to the store, you buy bread, peanut butter and jelly. There are two separate items, bread, peanut butter, the jelly, depending on which one you like. Some people like strawberry, some people like grape. Go home, take two slices of bread and on one side you would take a butter knife, grab a little measure of peanut butter, slide it on one side. You grab the jelly with the butter knife, if you will, put it on the other side of the bread and put it together."}, {"filename": "wright49a_5510_227535.wav", "transcript": "out the peanut butter and open the peanut butter jar and use a knife and spread peanut butter on one piece of bread.

Okay? The mother of one little boy had decided to have a birthday party for his fourth birthday. They took the boy and his two friends and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day and were planning to come back home to celebrate later. In order to prepare for the party, the mother had baked a three-layer cake and was really excited that the boy would like it. However, when they came home from the park, they found a bad surprise. The dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing on the crumbs all through the house. So when they got home, the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with the broom. You're not going to believe me, but anyway, two weeks ago, it was Saturday night, two weeks ago on a Saturday evening, about 6 p.m., I started feeling a stomach ache, I thought, or like a side stitch. Ironically enough, the pain started to travel down my back. I could feel it moving. It wasn't a muscle. I'm not a sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle, it wasn't a bone. Something was really weird and it was moving. They were kidney stones eventually, I found out. But I remember thinking, I don't have yet insurance here and I've just moved back and I haven't been to a hospital here in 20 years. This is going to be really horrible. And I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where I had a fever of 101 or something and it just was doubled over and couldn't even really stand as the thing was making its way down. So we went to the hospital and the first thing I walked in is, I said, I'm sorry to bring you a bad news. And the woman said, why? Did my husband die? That's the receptionist. And I said, that's a good joke. But anyway, I don't have insurance. And she said, that's no problem. You're going to get it. Come on in. And I remember thinking, okay, this is going to be all right. Three hours later, we're after some medicine and vomiting at least 40 times because of the intense pain, the most intense pain I've ever had in my life. Just imagine like stones going through that little opening. Sorry. And suddenly, and I was having these little strainer thing and seeing them come out and oh, and then for about a day, the blood and everything else. But I was amazed the body and how, and once they told me what it was, I read a little bit about it and realized it's not such a simple thing and how often we don't realize it. So water, people drink colas and coffees, colas, bubble gas drinks are the worst. And then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested. So I learned and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasn't even vomit. I thought my throat's going to come out because of the convulsions were so strong. And I just remember thinking my wife and son are coming next week and oh my God, here I am in the hospital. So I was really, I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it for the first time in my life ever. Not death, but enough to the point where something's seriously wrong here. That was the point of my story. I never had that."}, {"filename": "NEURAL38-1_1224771_1446441.wav", "transcript": "Okay, once upon a time there was a unpleasant woman with two unpleasant daughters who apparently was given a very nice daughter by a mysterious gentleman who didn't want to take care of her anymore.

Meanwhile, at the castle, the prince is being badgered by his odd-looking father that he must have a wife to be princess so that the evil patriarchy can continue on through history of the rule of the land.

Now, the evil daughters, they see her thinking that she has plans to go and they say, no, you're not going to go.

All right, we have a boy, probably in this backyard, playing soccer, practicing, and he kicks a soccer ball and it goes through a window. We don't know if it's his home or its neighbor's home, but it goes to the window, breaks the glass, and not only does it break the glass, it knocks over a lamp, probably breaks it too. And there's a gentleman sitting in a chair who is quite alarmed by this breaking glass and lamp falling over. And he gets up and goes to the window, holding the ball. And that's all I can see. He's looking at the window to see who kicked the ball. Here's another set of pictures that tell a story. Whenever you're ready, please tell me this story. Okay, in this story, mom is sending her little boy off, I'm guessing to school because he has a backpack, and she wants him to take the umbrella. And he is a know-it-all and says, oh no, I don't need the umbrella, I'm gonna be fine. Until he gets to the third picture and it starts raining. And it's raining and there's puddles and the groundwork, he's getting soaked, so he turns around and goes home. And mom looks at him rather sternly, almost like you deserve it. And the next picture, the end of it, he sets off for school again, this time he took mother's advice and has the umbrella. Thank you. So here is a picture, which you have definitely seen. I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and then tell me the story. Okay, in this picture, it appears that we have a cat that the dog chased up the tree, because the dog is still barking. And the cat is out on a limb, and there's a little girl trying, holding her arms up, hoping to catch the cat. Her tricycle is in front of her. And there's a ladder on the ground, and dad, apparently dad, is up the tree. And I am guessing that dad got on the ladder and climbed up the tree to try to get the cat. And the dog probably knocked the ladder down, but that's not for sure. But the ladder got knocked down. So now we have cat and dog, or cat and dad stuck in the tree. And someone has called the fire department. There's a firetruck parked out on the street, and we have two firemen running towards the tree with a ladder to resolve everything. And there is one other detail next. There's a bird on one of the branches."}, {"filename": "NEURAL17-2_503848_725196.wav", "transcript": "Yeah, so, yeah, it's a constant, it's a constant work and progress.

And one day he turned around and said to me, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, four times. And I'd never heard that word before. And so I didn't, but he said it with some kind of anger. So I just sat there and took it. Went home and I got in a fight with my older brother, who was always picking on me. And he kind of terrorized me, actually, but we're having some kind of fight with a window. Either he was trying to open it or I was trying to keep it closed or vice versa, I don't remember. But he was going to overpower me and I could sense that. And so I said, I repeated the same words to him. And he said, oh, you're going to get in so much trouble. And he screamed, mom, Mary just said the dirtiest word in the whole world. So anyway, that's my story. Oh, and then, you know, he continued to be, he started to become like, he just, I became like his picking point for walking home. He'd throw things at me and just, he was a bully, not a terrible bully, but a bully. I was scared of him. And he was on my walk home, back when we kids used to walk to school, but anyway.

Oh, I hate Cinderella stories. Oh, no. Okay, we'll stick with this one first. Let me begin. It's more fun when they're new.

And as the prince got older, it was time for him, his family decided it was time for him to take a wife. And so he was hosting a ball for all the eligible ladies in the kingdom. And Cinderella was also invited, but the stepmother was mean and would not provide a gown for Cinderella. So Cinderella's animal friends made her a beautiful gown. So when Cinderella was getting ready to leave for the ball, the stepsisters and the stepmother saw her beautiful gown and were very angry, tore the gown up so Cinderella could not go to the ball because she did not have clothes to wear. Then the fairy godmother appeared, created her beautiful gown with glass slippers, turned a pumpkin into a carriage, and I think the mice into horses, but warned Cinderella that she must be home by midnight because everything would return to normal. So Cinderella is off to the ball, gets there, the handsome prince sees her, is dancing, but then the clock starts to strike midnight. And so she runs down the stairs, losing one of her glass slippers, and the prince was unable to find her. And after she was away from the view of the prince, everything did turn back into the pumpkin and the mice, the original animals, but Cinderella had got to keep one of the glass slippers because it did not go away. And so the prince was so smitten by Cinderella, he was determined to find the person, the young lady, that the slipper would fit.

But Cinderella had the other glass slipper and came out, and the mice, Cinderella was actually locked up, but her animal friends were able to get her the key and they unlocked the door.

We had the completely different view of California. California was like this fantasy land, you know, awesome place to be, you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody. So when we moved here, or when we moved to California from New York, I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you, and one time, this man stopped and he was like, do you need a ride? And it was one of those days where it was, the evening was coming and the bats were like flying around and I was like, oh my gosh, I was so scared, am I gonna make it home? These bats are, so it was like a godsend when he stopped, you know, I was like, oh, okay, I get a ride and I have to deal with these bats. And I'm thinking, well, and everybody in, well, I'm in California, so this person can't possibly do me wrong. So I get in the car and I'm driving and it's like, how are you? And, you know, what's your name and where do you live? And then it just started getting weird when I said, make a right, and he said, well, I'm gonna make a left. And I'm like, no, go right. And then that's when I was like, okay, something's wrong here. And so I just prayed at that point, like that he would go right, go towards my house. And he's like, you sure you don't want something to drink? You know, I'm like, no, just please, just go right. And so he turned right. And then I said, here's my street, please turn. And anything, I didn't know what was gonna happen at that point. He pulled up in front of my house and he was still kind of rolling. And I just kind of opened the door and just kind of jumped out of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house. And nobody was home. So then I'm knocking on the door and the sun's going down. And I'm like, oh gosh, what if he's just still right there waiting for me? And so when I thought he was gone, I ran over to my neighbor's house, which is my best friend's house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home. Flooding began in Arizona this past weekend. And it flooded one of the streets and one of the washes over flooded. And a little girl was playing in the park where one of the washes are and she got pulled into the current.

And she was brought to the home of a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her. And she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters, but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the mom, her stepmom. And they actually put her to work and she had to do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose. But Cinderella was happy nonetheless and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the birds and such. And she was a very kindred spirit, that Cinderella. And she got news, or overheard news, that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride. And they invited all the eligible women from the kingdom and in her heart she thought, I would just love to go to that ball. And she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella. But the stepsisters were going to go and she had to help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball. And Cinderella was sad. She went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said, we'll help you Cinderella. And they brought out some ribbon and some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her. And she had the dress but she had no way of getting to the ball and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared and it was her fairy godmother. And my fairy godmother said, don't cry my child, I know you want to go to the ball and I can help you. Just fetch me a pumpkin and I'll turn it into a coach and your mice friends will be the coachmen. So she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the coachmen. And off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world. And when she got there, she approached the ball and looked down the stairs and there everyone was dancing and they saw her come in and they turned and looked at her and the prince looked and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman that he had ever seen. He invited her to dance and they just had a nice connection. And she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing and suddenly the time had gone by and it was midnight and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight. So quick she ran from the castle and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper and she found her way home. And the prince retrieved the slipper and was determined to find the fair maiden who left it there. So he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them and everyone tried on the slipper. And when he came to the house where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived, the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper and it didn't quite work but Cinderella apparently was locked up in a room upstairs and the mice gave her the key. And she got out and she came down and she said she'd like to try on the slipper and with that she tried on the slipper and her fairy godmother, her wicked stepmother and her sisters were amazed that she could have been that beautiful person that night. But as it was, she tried on the slipper, he knew she was the princess that he wanted and they got married and they lived happily ever after. I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness."}, {"filename": "NEURAL11-2_25608_243221.wav", "transcript": "Okay. Well, just to not be redundant, I'll talk about something else. I did think of another surgery that I had when I was younger was a, when I was a teenager, getting my wisdom teeth taken out. And I think a lot of people probably have had that done as a, I'm telling you my dog does this every time. I know that messes up the transcriptions. Don't worry. Sorry. But anyway, so when I was 16, I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out. And again, I'd never really had to have any anesthesia or anything like that. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course, it was an outpatient situation. But since a lot of my friends had had it done before, I kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then because I know now people videotape people coming out of the anesthesia. But I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I'd never had anesthesia before. So it was kind of interesting. And I just remember being, having the cotton all in my mouth when I was trying to talk. And it was rather painful. I remember that too. And then having just, it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had. I know from last week that you do, in fact, have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. So again, just share what problems that you've experienced with people who have a hard time communicating and things that you've done about that to help. Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research, it's been really interesting to me having to communicate with folks. It's a little bit more difficult when you're on a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has aphasia. I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this. But I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate, make sure that I ask questions, ask yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman who is actually in Mexico. They went on a trip to Mexico before the quarantine. And they actually kind of got stuck down there because they don't want to put her on a plane. And so anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit. And we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So it was a challenge to help because she did have some probably moderate aphasia. And her son was on the phone too. So I was on the speakerphone. So just that whole thing of really slowing everything down, asking her questions several times, and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that definitely makes you think about all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have aphasia. And I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one-on-one communication with folks. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from when you were a child or more recently. Again, you can tell the same story as last week, or you can choose a different story. A little different story. I have lots of stories. I think all speech pathologists have lots of stories, right?"}, {"filename": "NEURAL20-2_644282_861680.wav", "transcript": "And he is very surprised to see a soccer ball come whopping through his window with probably, it does break the glass which lands on the floor. And it's unclear if it's his house, we'll say it is. And he gets up and now he wants to know who has done that. So he looks out through the hole of the broken window and he sees the boy. And we don't have any more pictures here, but I think the little boy says, oh, I am so sorry, I'm so sorry. And we'll assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry, sir, that I broke your window, but I will work for you to try to replace it. And so that's what he did. So again, these panels of pictures tell a story. Take a second to look them over. They go left to right and then bottom and then left to right again. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle and an end. The little boy has his backpack on and he's getting ready to go to school. And his mom says, it's raining outside or it's going to rain and you better take an umbrella. And he says, no, look, the sky is completely clear. I don't wanna take an umbrella, but I think you better. The weather report says it's going to rain, but he won't do it. And so she said, all right, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school and sure enough, pretty soon it starts raining, drip, drip, drip. And as then he keeps on, he starts to continue, but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now. And he's really upset and he runs back home, drip, drip, drip on the kitchen floor. And his mother says, I told you. And he said, well, you are right. I do need an umbrella. So this time he was willing to take the umbrella. He put it up and off he went in the rain on his way to school. All right, so this first picture tells a story. Take a second to look it over. And whenever you're ready, tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle and an end. Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat. And one day the dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree. And there the cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see from the picture, the dog is still barking. So of course the cat isn't going to come down. And she probably cried and cried. And finally her father came out and what's the matter? Kitty cat is up in the tree and the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat. And so he did, but the dog is still barking. It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage, but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get, but he can't get as far out as the cat is. If he did, he would surely break the limb and he would fall. So as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody, maybe the mother in the house saw what was happening and she called the fire department. And so here comes the fire department. They are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away and rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree, but the dog is no longer barking. So the cat jumps down.

Called the ambulance, got him to Methodist Hospital where in the middle of the night he had three hours of skull surgery. And the surgeon told us afterwards, well, I fixed his skull, but I cannot fix his brain. So after that, he was one month in Methodist Hospital in the traumatic brain injury area. And then he was discharged and he went to a community rehabilitation hospital for another month for both speech and physical and occupational therapy. After that, he was sent to a subacute rehab place called Hamilton Trace where he spent the next three months. Then he came home to our house and we set up a hospital bed for him here in our living room. And then he had speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy and a nurse who came to see us in our home. And that occupied just about every morning of the week. And that went on during the summer. And then they decided they'd done what they could for him. And then we signed him up for rehabilitation services at community outpatient places, one place. And he went there, I think it was three times a week for two to three hours at a time. And that lasted until pretty much the end of the year when they gently said, we think it would be good if you would take a little vacation from us now. And what they really meant was we've done all we can for you, goodbye. But we also got Ted signed up with a place called NeuroHope. NeuroHope offered physical therapy but not the other two modalities. And so he has been a patient at NeuroHope ever since.

I need that umbrella so that I don't ruin the school's tablet. So he went back, and that's when he realized and that's what he did.

But by watching her expressions on her face and her lips, I was actually able to understand what she said. And I made sure that I looked at her when I was answering her questions back so she could read my lips. And we didn't have to have anybody interpret or write down anything. So it was good. Good. Go ahead and tell me what happened. Years ago when my daughter was in college, and we lived in Texas, I lived in the Dallas area. And she was going to school at Texas A&M. And unbeknownst to me, she decided to fly to Alabama for the weekend to see an old boyfriend, but told everyone that she was driving to Dallas to see me. So when I tried to get a hold of her, I couldn't. She wasn't at work. I could not find her. And that was before cell phones were used. And I, worst fear, was thinking she'd been in a car accident on the way to Dallas. And so I had to start. I got down to see her, because I used to work for an attorney. A piece of paper, I started writing down things I needed to do. First I called the Highway Patrol. No reports of accidents. And then I started calling hospitals. And no, nobody's there. And then I started remembering friends' names, getting numbers. And they were lying for her. And I finally got one to admit where she had gone. And in the meantime, I had called my friend, who was my attorney. And he came over. And we actually tracked her down in a nightclub in Alabama with the ex-boyfriend. And of course, was very relieved that she was OK. But after the attorney got through talking to her, saying that she needed to apologize, and that this would never happen again, and it never did. This young lady was actually out on a third date with her boyfriend in the high country. And they went across a slow-moving creek and didn't have any problems. And they decided to come back across it like several hours later. And of course, the water was much more swift. It swept them down. They actually got swept out of their vehicle. And she clung to a tree for three hours as the cold water raced by her. And they called for help. And finally, rescue people actually were able to take a raft and get close enough so that one of the rescue gentlemen could get a hold of her and bring her back to shore. A young fellow was playing soccer. And apparently, his yard or possibly his neighbor's yard. And he had such good kicking ability, his soccer ball went through the window, breaking the window, landing inside the living room, knocking over a lamp, surprising the gentleman that was sitting in the chair there. And the gentleman gets up, holding the soccer ball, and looks out the window wondering what had just happened."}, {"filename": "wright48a_707871_921193.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella was a little girl who became an orphan at a young age.

They would make her clean, wash all the dishes, clean the floors, wash their clothes, scrub the floors, do everything that they didn't want to do, and treat her badly. Then they got an invitation to go to the ball, and Cinderella and her stepmom and stepsisters were all invited, and so right away, all her little friends, the little animals, decided to sew her a beautiful gown, and Cinderella was so excited about it and going to the ball. And then her stepmom dropped a bomb and said, you're not going anywhere. You're going to stay here, and you're going to cook, and you're going to clean, and you're going to make sure that this house is spotless by the time we get back. So Cinderella's spirits were down immediately. She was really looking forward to going, and she was sitting there crying. She was sitting there crying, and then along comes the fairy godmother to save the day, and she touches Cinderella with her wand, and she's in a beautiful gown, and then she touches the pumpkin, and it turns into a beautiful chariot with horses, and off Cinderella goes to the ball. Beknownst to her stepmother and sisters, Cinderella's at the ball dancing and having a ball, having fun, and dancing with the prince. And then she turns around, and the clock strikes twelve or one, I can't remember, and she says, oh my gosh, I have to go, otherwise I'm going to turn back into my house clothes and my cleaning clothes. So she runs out the door, and she loses a slipper, but she still has one on. So she gets home, and she's thinking about how wonderful the ball was, and then a knock comes at the door, and they say, we have a slipper here, and we don't know who it belongs to, so we're going around town letting all the ladies try them on to see who it belongs to, because that will be who the prince marries. And so Cinderella's listening, and she's hoping that she gets to try the shoe on, and her stepmom was like, you don't need to try it on her, she wasn't there.

Cinderella, in this book, evidently opens up a chest and finds a ball gown, and maybe a diary or something of her mother's, I don't remember that as being part of the story, but that seems to be in the book, and puts out the ball gown to plan to go, but when she gets dressed, everybody rejects the idea that she can go and she stays home. The godmother arrives and arranges for her to go, and gets an even more beautiful dress for her to wear. The story, as I remember it, always had the carriage that was generated from a pumpkin that she goes in, I don't even remember seeing that in the book. She goes to the ball, makes a hit with the prince, but she has to leave at midnight, otherwise she will return to the clothes she was wearing before she got the ball dress, and her carriage will turn into a pumpkin, and she races out of the ball before trying to get home before midnight, and loses a shoe in the glass slipper in the course of the process. The prince is left having no idea where to find this young woman that he's become entranced with, and he has only the shoe, and they put out a proclamation that the shoe should be taken throughout the kingdom until they find who it fits.

So Cinderella hears her and waves goodbye and then she travels to the ball where she meets the prince and dances with him. They sort of have the love at first sight kind of thing going on. They dance and even her stepmother and stepsisters see her but don't recognize her. They dance and then time goes by because they're so happy, time goes by that they don't realize that the time has gone by. They're so happy they don't realize the time has gone by. And at stroke the clock is striking twelve and Cinderella is reminded that the spell will be over and so she rushes away but in her haste to run away before the spell elapses she loses a glass slipper and the prince picks it up and he doesn't, he says something like what's your name, where will you go, how will I find you? And she runs away. And so she had a wonderful time at the ball and Cinderella is actually pretty ready, is ready to live pretty content on the fact that she had a really nice night and life sort of goes back to the way it was except for the prince is looking for her because he loves her and so he starts visiting all the maidens in the kingdom and asking them to try on this glass slipper and by the time the messenger arrives at their home the stepsisters and Lady Tremaine have actually realized that the king is seeking out this mysterious girl that he met at the ball and Lady Tremaine actually puts together that Cinderella was at the ball because Cinderella is singing a song and dancing and is happy and so she sort of puts together that she's the mysterious girl that the prince is looking for and she locks Cinderella in her room and puts the key in her pocket and then she goes downstairs to greet the advisor who comes with the sort of funny looking man with the shoe on a pillow to try on a shoe and the glass slipper doesn't fit Anastasia and Drizella's foot although they try to deceive them into thinking that it does but really their feet are much too big and the animals meanwhile steal the key from Lady Tremaine's pocket, take it all the way up the stairs and unlock the door so Cinderella comes out just in the nick of time and the messenger is happy to see her and Cinderella is like, I'll try on the glass slipper and Lady Tremaine trips him and the glass slipper breaks and the advisor is really upset because he thinks the king is going to be mad but then Cinderella produces the other glass slipper and it fits and then she gets to be the princess, she gets to marry the prince and be the princess and they live happily ever after except for her ballroom gown was way better than her wedding gown."}, {"filename": "wright51a_737128_949106.wav", "transcript": "So they walked outside and Cinderella said that I don't have a way to get there and The fairy godmother says well get get that pumpkin and those mice They're your friends.

So they all part. So so Cinderella now was able to go to the ball. She got into the carriage and Off to the ball they went When Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty. They couldn't believe how incredible she looked But what she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having She tried to remember one thing that their fairy godmother had told her she says she needed to be back by midnight she says if she wasn't back by midnight the pumpkin was going to turn back in or the carriage was going to turn back into a pumpkin and That the horses were going to turn back into mice and that the chauffeur chauffeur was going to turn back into the dog so Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then she was having so much fun She lost track the time when she looked up at the clock She noticed that it was almost 12 o'clock and while she was dancing with the prince She quickly broke away from him says I gotta go. I gotta go and she's in the princess. No, you can't go I think I found my true love Cinderella continued to run I got to go I must go and as Cinderella was running out She left the shoe behind she hesitated for a second to get it, but realized she didn't have enough time so she quickly hopped into the carriage the carriage drove off and Got her home just in time clothes turned to rags the carriage turned into a pumpkin the horse turned into Mice and the chauffeur turned into the dog Back at the palace the prince While he was chasing Cinderella notice that there was a glass slipper that was still there So he picked up the glass slipper and said I must find this woman.

So anyway Cinderella is a scullery made essentially to the family. Meanwhile the prince, the king of the kingdom announces that his son the prince should marry and they announce a ball to which Cinderella's family are invited. I think it's yes they invite all the eligible women in the kingdom so they all get and everybody's excited and the including the stepsisters who are not as pretty as Cinderella but the mean girls kind of wreck Cinderella's dress. I'd forgotten that part until I saw the picture again this time. So she's left without a ball gown and they leave her behind and go off to the ball without her but she is rescued by her fairy godmother who creates a dress for her and changes a pumpkin into a carriage and I think the mice are the ones that become the footmen and off Cinderella goes to the ball with the admonition that she has to be done by midnight because all of the magic will end then. So she goes to the ball everybody is amazed at how beautiful she is including Prince. They dance the clock starts to strike 12 and she runs out of the ball to get in her coach and leave me and she leaves behind a slipper a glass slipper it is in the Disney version and she gets home and of course everything returns to the pumpkin it was. The next day the prince or sometime the prince is looking for the girl who dropped her slipper because he is she is the girl he loves and they go about trying the shoe on having every girl who was in the kingdom try the shoe on it doesn't fit the stepsisters and everyone is shocked in the household when it fits Cinderella.

But what I came to find out about her was that she was Jewish, I am Christian. She was in a concentration camp in Germany, and thank goodness she managed to make it through, and she was on one of the first boats out to this country because she had relatives who had come over generations earlier in Chicago, and she ended up in Paducah, Kentucky. We liked each other so very much that we became scout troop leaders together, and in the process of all this, of all the planning, we spent a lot of time together, and she told me much about her life in Germany and about the terrible, terrible times of the Holocaust. One of the things that I remember vividly, the only reason that she really lasted, her mother was Gentile, her father was Jewish, and the line goes through the mothers, if you probably know this, the Jewish line goes through the mothers, and because of this, her uncle, Ursula's uncle, was her mother's brother, and he was of course Gentile, and he was the police officer in the town where she lived, so he was able to keep her off the list of the children who were going off to the concentration camps, but finally at the end, he couldn't do it anymore, and she told me one time, which just broke my heart, he sent her and her three siblings off to concentration camp, but he would not look at them, or at her mother. The mother and the father managed to stay in Dresden, and they were both killed in the firebombing in Dresden, just before the war was over, but probably that was one of the most, and it was secondhand to me, it was not something that happened to me, but it was something that I became very much involved in, because I listened to her stories, and she didn't just tell me the story, it was things she just told me little by little, and finally in the village where she grew up, they were going to, they had asked her to come back, they wanted her to come back, they paid her, they were going to pay her, get her to come, they wanted some closure for them too, because it's a long, it was a terrible time, and she wouldn't go, and she wouldn't go, and finally I think, about a year, and she talked to me about it a lot, she finally decided she would go, she didn't think it was a very good idea, but she went, and when she came back, she said, I'm glad I went, I was able to forgive."}, {"filename": "wright53a_718391_928380.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella was a beautiful young woman who had two stepsisters and a stepmother that came into her family when her dad married, because her mother had died.

So one day there was an invitation for all three, there was an invitation to go to a ball, and Cinderella was not included in the invitation because the stepmother wanted her two stepdaughters to go and meet the prince. There was a prince that was looking for a bride, so the stepsisters got all dressed up and ready to go, and Cinderella was left feeling very left out, but Cinderella turned out to have a fairy godmother who dressed her up in the most gorgeous dress so that she was the most exquisite person at the ball, and she had all these little angels around that, mice scurrying around to help her, and all of a sudden a pumpkin coach arrived with the fairy godmother's wave of the wand. Cinderella dressed up beautifully, got in the coach, went to the ball, but the fairy godmother said you have to be home by twelve o'clock at midnight in order for this to work, so Cinderella met the prince. The two stepsisters were raving mad because she was so beautiful and the prince was giving her all the attention, and the prince and Cinderella had a wonderful time together, but then Cinderella realized she had to be on the way out by twelve o'clock, so she ran down the steps of the ballroom to get back into the coach and left one of her shoes on the steps. She was in such a hurry, her shoe fell off.

She performed several tasks. At one point, an invitation comes to a ball, and they're considering happily going. Cinderella's face is lighting up, but she doesn't realize what's going on. The ball is held because the king decided that it was time for the son to marry, and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town. Well, Cinderella would love to go, and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going, because the stepmother and the stepsisters had to focus only on themselves. So they prepared, had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy, but there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family. Well, there's a book in the picture, and the picture book I don't remember at all. She discovers a book.

I didn't see much in the book about the time frame, but that was a big thing in the movie that I remember, and just the clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight, but she had to get out of there by midnight, and she does, but then there is the return of the slipper, the finding of the slipper, so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night, but as I said, the book seems a little bit different. There's a key, and I guess when she lets everyone in, finally, where is he? Why is the key there?

In the meantime, Cinderella made friends with the animals and these type of people because they wanted to make her happy.

He came across the house that Cinderella lived in and the mother had her locked in a room because she did not want her to be let out for the prince to even try on the shoe.

We have to be honest, they were very ugly. So there's a great deal of stress. After Cinderella's father apparently died, she was just left with a stepmother and these two sisters, and they used to make her clean, and they used to make her cook, and they were very mean to her, and they made her live in the attic, and they made her wear old, ugly clothes. She was very, very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative. And she befriended all the animals in the house, the mice and the birds. And when she looked out the window every day, she used to see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father, the king and queen of Fantasia Land. And so she used to dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress, a fancy ball there, and wearing a beautiful gown. She never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her, and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear. And they always said to her, you'll never go to the ball, you'll never go to the palace. So one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big, very big dance because the king was sick and tired of his son not getting married, seriously. All the pressure that goes on for women, just as much for men. And it was time for the prince to get married because one day he was going to be the king and he needed to have children, he needed to have a wife. So they were going to have a big ball. So they're having a ball and Cinderella's ugly, mean, stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go. And they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes. And Cinderella really, really wanted to go. She was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go. But the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds. And they knew how to sew and they knew how to accessorize and they knew how to design dresses apparently. So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella. And she was so surprised and so excited. Then she went to the ball. And at the ball, she met the prince and it was just love at first sight, the way it should be. He loved her and she loved him and they had a wonderful time dancing. And then her sisters saw her and were very, very upset that she was there and they were pulling her dress and they were tearing her skirt and they chased her away and made her go home. But then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry. And so he sent out a message to all the houses in the land saying he wanted to come because he had found the magic slipper, the glass slipper that she had left. And he was looking for because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry. But the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper.

One father had gone across the... or had attempted to cross the road. He thought because he had a pickup truck. He would be just fine.

Daughter was in her seatbelt. He was able to get out of his seatbelt. And he climbed to the top of the truck and over the other side, where he reached in and got his daughter. The water swept them off the top of the truck. And as they were swept downstream, they caught a tree. And the girl hung onto the tree alone because her father had been swept further down and he had to grab another tree down the way. Someone watching, who had seen everything, had called 911. The fire department got there and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree. One particularly strong, handsome young firefighter put on his life vest, jumped out into the water, grabbed the tree, put his arms around the little girl, and she clung to him, knowing that her life depended on it. He held her very tightly while he put another belt around her. It was a belt similar to the one he was wearing. And they tied themselves together with the belt. And his friends back on shore, the other firefighters, pulled him back to the shore with the girl. When she was safe, a different firefighter went in after the father and got him safely out.

It's not going to rain. I don't wanna carry anything. I'm just gonna go. And so he left without the umbrella. Five minutes later into his walk to school, it starts pouring down rain and Jordan starts running. The puddles are splashing and he's getting soaking wet. He runs all the way back home and his mom is really angry. He's dripping water all over the floor. So he gets the umbrella and heads back on his way to school. The end. All correct. That was an excellent story. Okay, so here is one more short sequence of pictures. And again, I want you to look at the pictures and tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. There was a boy named Bo and he was practicing for soccer tryouts. He was practicing and practicing for hours when he let the ball get a little out of control and it went sailing through the neighbor's window. The glass shatters and his neighbor who's watching TV is scared to death because the ball comes flying through the window and knocks over the lamp. He gets up and he goes looking for, of course, who kicked the ball through the window, but he can't find them. So he patches the window and goes back to watching TV."}, {"filename": "capilouto58a_407753_615450.wav", "transcript": "Well, I have one thing that, to me, is the high point of my entire life, and it happened twenty-four years ago. We were at the hospital with my daughter and my son-in-law expecting their first baby, and they, of course, went back, and my husband and I were in the waiting room, and my son-in-law came out, and he said, we're in a birthing room, and you all can come back and visit a little while. So we went back, and, of course, Pam was in bed, and she was fine and laughing, and we were all talking, and all of a sudden she had pain, which, that happens, and her father immediately jumped up and he said, I'll go back out to the waiting room, and I said, okay, we'll do that then. It wasn't good seeing his baby daughter suffer, and so we got up to go back out, and my son-in-law got a very stricken look on his face, and he said, you're not going to leave me, are you? And I said, oh, darling, you don't want me here. This is a very special time for you and Pam. You certainly don't want your mother-in-law here. He said, yes, I do, and Gordon said, why don't I go back to the apartment, and you stay here with the children, and then you can call me when it gets here and tell me what it is. And I looked at Rick, and he said, yeah, why don't you do that? And I said, well, all right, if you're sure. Well, it took all night long, and Rick was on one side of her bed, and I was on the other side, and we just had the most delightful evening. Pam wasn't enjoying it all that much, but Rick and I were, and when the baby really started to come, and the doctor was there, and of course, I was still there, and Rick was still there, and I wanted it to be a girl. I was an only girl. My daughter was my first child, and she was a girl, and we're all named for my father. We carried his family name down, and I wanted this one, the first grandchild, to be a girl so I could have the name carried down again. And Pam had had an ultrasound, and they told him it was a boy, and she was so afraid I was going to be disappointed, and I was looking and looking and trying to see, and finally the doctor looked up at me, and he said, Grandmother, if you'd move back just a little bit, I might be able to catch this baby when it comes out. So we laughed, and he did catch the baby, but when it came out, it was my girl. It wasn't a boy. They made a mistake on the ultrasound, and, well, my name is Evelyn Brewer-Smith, Pamela is Pamela Brewer-Smith Foster, and that baby is Rachel Brewer Foster. So that was my, and to be there, and to actually see her born, and of course, the doctor gave her to Rick first, and then Rick gave her to me, and so I laughingly say, I always love my son-in-law, but never quite as much as I did that night. He really became mine that night. So that's my big story."}, {"filename": "richardson19_768606_976146.wav", "transcript": "Well, we have a nice little country scene that it appears how it started is that a cat, this little girl's cat, ran up into this tree. She was riding along, riding her bicycle, and I guess the cat was playing with her, and the cat goes up into the tree and is not willing to come down. So this man, we'll say it's her dad, decides to help her out and to climb up into the tree to rescue the kitty cat, then this dog decides he's not happy about that, and so is either barking at some combination of the bird, the man, and the cat, has somebody tree, I don't know that he really cares who, there's, I guess the dog has probably also knocked this ladder over that the man used to climb up into the tree, and then, because now everybody is stuck in the tree, the fire department has been called for them to come and rescue, to help the little girl get her cat out of the tree, and then to help the man get out of the tree without getting attacked by this dog, and this little bird is just over here not really giving a care about anything, and is just enjoying the whole scene. So, we will assume that all of this worked out nicely, and everybody came down safe and sound, the cat is rescued, the man is no longer afraid, and the fireman has sufficiently done their duty. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, so the next two are sequences of pictures that tell a story, so I just want you to look at each picture and kind of just tell me about the story that you see there, okay? Okay. I feel like this is like a Fasia Rorschach test all in one. What do you see? Okay, so this little boy is getting ready to leave for school, his mother has clearly checked the weather channel, and is pretty sure that the weather is going to be bad, and so is trying to offer him the umbrella to go to school, or to use for school, then he denies it, he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to use it, leaves for school without it, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain, he's getting a little wet, but it's no big deal, but then as he's coming home from school, it's very wet and rainy, and so he's getting quite soaked, is walking through puddles, walks back into his house soaking wet, at which point his mother says, I told you so, and hands him the umbrella again to be able to leave and to stay dry while he's walking to school. Okay. Alright, so two more stories, so this one and then another story that doesn't have pictures. Okay. Okay, so in this one there is a dad kicking a soccer ball, just playing in his yard, eventually or as he's playing, kicks it a little too hard and knocks it into, knocks it through a window in a house, as, when it goes through the window it knocks over a lamp and scares the guy sitting on the couch, and then the guy that was inside now, or has a soccer ball and is probably not happy with the kid who just kicked it through his window, and that he's going to have to replace the window and the lamp."}, {"filename": "NEURAL29-1_834935_1042435.wav", "transcript": "Well, there once was a time that Cinderella and her two sisters and her evil mother, they lived near a kingdom where the king lived and his son, which was the prince, they were having a party and they were inviting Cinderella and her family to the kingdom for the ball. The letter came from the king and the mother told Cinderella she had to stay home and clean the house. She wasn't allowed to go to the ball. She was, I think, the ugly sister or the sister that didn't belong. So the mother and the two sisters went to the ball. Cinderella decided that she was going to go to the ball. She got her beautiful dress on and the fairy godmother showed up and turned her pumpkin and her rodents into a stagecoach, a pumpkin with horses. Cinderella went to the ball and their sisters and mother were very upset why she showed up to the ball. Prince saw her, fell in love with her at first sight. They ended up dancing. When the clock struck 12, she would turn back into Cinderella with no beautiful dress. The pumpkin or the stagecoach would shrink back to a pumpkin and the animals would go back from horses to rodents. The prince was very upset he couldn't find Cinderella. Cinderella ran out the door. She lost her slipper or her shoe and the prince found it on the boardwalk and he wanted to find out where this woman went to and who she was. She never got her name.

But I used to run 35, 40 miles a week, so I'm used to running. But a couple years ago, I was just running across the little grassy field. And I started to speed up because it had started to rain. And as I was running, I got this sudden pain in my left leg. And I had to walk and walk with a little bit of pain back to the car. So when I got home, I put some ice on my knee and didn't think a whole lot of it until the next couple of days. And what would happen then was that I would get excruciating pain at times when I would attempt to put my left foot down onto the ground. And the pain would only be gone as I lift my leg off of the ground. I had no idea what was causing this. But the pain was so severe, I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer. But in this case, you hit it with a hammer and it's gone. As long as I stood on that knee, that intense pain would be there. So I finally went to an orthopedic doctor. And after taking x-rays and an MRI, they found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot-handled tear, where the femur had actually gone through. And the meniscus was still totally intact. But it looked like a teapot, where you have that slender handle above the top of it. And he said, well, that's going to continue to do that to your femur unless we go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery. And you plan these surgeries. And unfortunately, things don't always go real well. I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day. I think this day it was 1 PM. So I got there. You had to go there an hour or so ahead of time. I ended up having it done at St. Joe's Hospital, even though I was going to be an in-out patient. And I went in there. And they clean your leg up and everything. And it turns out, though, that this particular set of surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up. So my appointment at 1 in the afternoon actually took place at 6 in the afternoon. And they finally wheeled me into the room. I, not having any idea what they were going to do, I'm pulled into the room. And they put me off of the one bed onto the real bed. I feel these doctors, like, grabbing my leg and slamming it up against this rubber mount to the left of my leg. I knew that they were going to do arthroscopic surgery. But I had not had any inkling of how this would all happen. In fact, I thought it might have been so simple. I had asked them to just numb the leg."}, {"filename": "wright42a_1138595_1344291.wav", "transcript": "And she turned the pumpkin into the coach.

But remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight, you will become the same Cinderella that you were before, no matter where you are. You need to come home. So as the clock was striking the midnight, she ran from the ball and ran from the prince. On her way out, she lost her slipper, one of her glass slippers. She got to her coach, and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin. And the animals turned back into the mice and the cat. She made her way home, wondering if she would ever see the prince again. As it turned, the prince was so excited about this pretty young woman that he wanted to meet her. He had kept the glass slipper and knew that he had to see her again. So he sent out a decree to look for the young woman who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper, that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her. All of the women, the young women, decided to go and try the slipper, but none of them could make it fit, including her sisters, cousins. So eventually, she was able to go and see the prince and try on the slipper. And the prince announced that this was the woman that he would marry. And they all lived happily ever after. Well, at the very beginning, there was a bird that was hopping around in the yard. And a little girl's cat started chasing after the bird. Well, somewhere along the line, the commotion was recognized by a neighbor's dog. And the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree. The bird was in the tree. The cat was in the tree. The little girl called for her father. He came over with a ladder and got up in the tree to try and get the cat down. Well, the ladder fell, so now he was trapped in the tree.

He has, like, I think he's a manic depressive and bipolar. He's crazy, he's insane. Like, he'll go off the walls. So he's playing beer pong at this party in the backyard. And there's all people crowding around the table. It's a big party. And he wins. He wins the game. Or I think he either wins the game or scores a point. And he goes, yeah, and he rips off his shirt. And another guy standing kind of next to Tal and I in the middle of the table is, like, kind of like, what the heck is that? You know, he kind of says a curse word, like, you know, what the F are you doing and everything else. And Harry's like, what are you talking about, you know? And then Tal, my friend, best friend, standing next to me, and he turns to Ken, like, I don't remember what he said too much, but he was kind of like trying to put him in his place, telling him, you know, you better watch yourself. You better shut up or something. And the kid starts to get in his face. And the kid's much bigger than Tal. He's about the same size as me. And he gets in his face and he's like, you know, they're starting to argue and it's getting heated. And all the while, when things start to get bad like that, or when things get scary, or when I get scared, the thing that I always do is I get very quiet and I don't mean to do it, but I kind of, like, I heighten my senses. I feel everything heighten and I just listen and look and feel and try to take it as much as I can and I get ready. And make a long story short, the kid gets in his face and I simply, my friend Tal's shorter than me, he's like 5'7\". He's kind of about that, about 5'7\". I put my head kind of closer to his near shoulder and I just sit there looking at the guy and standing next to Tal. And I'm scared because I don't like fighting. I don't ever want to see fighting. I don't want to see a punch thrown. I don't want to see, even we, you know, in my mind, you know, we could have had, we had a lot more people at the party that we knew. He didn't. I mean, really, we knew that it could have been bad for him, but I still didn't want to see anyone get hurt. So I'm getting scared and, you know, I just stand there calmly and quietly and don't lose my cool even though I'm nervous and looking at the kid and just waiting for him to take a swing at Tal. Because then Tal knows and I know that we're going to go buck wild on him. And it's not like I'm a big guy or a bad guy. It's just, that's how I feel. I'm getting ready to jump in the fight. And, you know, they eventually go back and forth and everyone says stuff. And eventually, you know, I don't know if, I think Tal says it. Tal's like, dude, seriously, you better get out of here. You better stop because you're way outnumbered right now. You have nobody with you. We could really, and the guy's like, no. But eventually it just quiets down.

He did what he loves most and was to play soccer. He took his ball out and was kicking along, walking along down his neighborhood street, when suddenly, one swift kick and crash. The ball came crashing through his neighbor's window. The neighbor is taken by surprise. And the ball comes sailing in and lands on his lap as he's relaxing on the couch. He picks up the ball, looks over to the window, and looks out. Who could have kicked that ball? He couldn't see anyone. Must be that neighbor boy that's always out in the yard with his soccer ball. Must be him. I'm going to call his parents immediately. First, I'm going to pick up the glass off this couch and get it cleaned up, and then I'll call them and find out what's going on. He calls the neighbors. Mr. Smith picks up the phone, and the man says, is your son missing his soccer ball? Because I see some initials here, JR. Isn't your son James Robb? And Mr. Smith says, yes, what happened? Did you find his ball? He said, yes, I found it in my living room. It came right through my glass. Mr. Smith said, I'll take care of it. He calls his son and says, James Robb, are you missing your soccer ball? James said, no, I have about 10 soccer balls. If I'm missing one, I wouldn't really notice it. His dad says, well, our neighbor found one on his lap. It had sailed through his window, and he is livid because it broke his window. Could that possibly be your ball? No, Dad, that couldn't possibly be my ball. I was out kicking the ball today, but I don't remember it going through anybody's window. He said, well, that's a shame because your initials are marked on the ball on the Sharpie. Remember, I reminded you to do that so you wouldn't lose them? And your initials are on the ball. Oh, oh, wow. I was too afraid to tell anybody, Dad. I'm sorry. What should we do? And he said, well, the first thing you need to do is to get some money from your piggy bank and take it over and offer to pay for his window. And then I think that you better apologize and never kick the ball out near his yard again. OK, Dad, that's what I'll do. Sorry, Dad. He said, well, you've learned a lesson. Next time an accident happens, come straight to me and tell me, and we'll take care of it, but don't ever hide from your responsibilities. OK, Dad, I will. So the next day, they went over to the neighbor's house. James Robb brought his piggy bank, and he said he was willing to pay for the broken window and said how sorry he was. Neighbor said, don't worry, my homeowner's insurance covers it. I know it was an accident. I appreciate your honesty and your integrity for coming forth. By the way, when's your next soccer game? I'd really like to come and see. You've got quite a kick. So all ended well for the family and the neighbor.

So they ripped the dress up, and Cinderella was sent down to the cellar. And she cried. And then all of a sudden, a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying. And she told her story to the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother waved her wand, and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with glass slippers. And then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin, and it turned into a beautiful carriage. And she waved her wand over the mice, and the mice turned into horses. So Cinderella arrived at the royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress. She met the prince, and they danced the night away. But the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out till midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight. So Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight, and she ran away. And the prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her, but he couldn't catch up with her. Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her glass slippers on the stairs. She made it to the carriage and got home just in time. And the carriage turned back into a pumpkin, or the horses turned back into mice. The prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because his heart belonged to her now. So he sent couriers across the land again with the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper. And then he would know who was the beautiful woman at the ball. So when the courier got to Cinderella's house, the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slipper on. But unfortunately, the slipper didn't fit either one of them. And Cinderella came out of the cellar and sat down. And the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle, and she and the prince lived happily ever after."}, {"filename": "wright48a_560_202996.wav", "transcript": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you take two slices of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, and you spread peanut butter.

Today is Johnny's eighth birthday and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing happy birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him. As when mommy and Johnny stepped out of the kitchen, they walked back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake, there was a big bite taken out of the cake, and they looked to see that the prince led right to the dog under the couch. Mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrived and Johnny cried. The guests, as the guests walked in, they said, oh my, what are we going to do now? But the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything, so the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home. In fourth grade, I was outside during recess in New York and as you may or may not know, they have, we play in the streets, in the public schools anyway, in the inner city. We don't have a playground, so they put up the barriers and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street. So I was standing against one of the cars and a friend of mine ran right into me and my wrist went right around the rear view mirror and broke. So they called my mom and my mom came and I was just crying and she rushed me to the doctor. We took, I think we took the bus because she didn't want to pay for an ambulance, so I'm in pain on the bus, I'm crying, I'm trying to keep it still and got to the hospital and they had to put a cast on me and that was my first time having a cast and got back to school and all my friends signed it. So that was cool. And then the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside and so I remember one time my mom used one of the straws from the broom to try and itch and it broke in there. So then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to it. And that was about all I remember about that and I, oh and then I remember using it as a weapon too, if somebody bothered me I'd hit them with it, but then I would feel it too.

So I guess the standard story would be the cat climbed into the tree and wasn't having any problems, but the girl was really concerned that the cat is trapped in the tree and wound up being a cat skeleton up there in a few days. So she got her dad and her dad climbed up on the tree and couldn't really quite get out as far as the cat. Meanwhile, the dog knocked over the ladder that dad used to climb up the tree and is kind of angry with dad. Somebody used the cell phone and called the fire department because somehow the fire department knows about it.

Leave her at home to do work and be locked up. Then her fairy godmother appears and creates a wonderful dress and carriage and horsemen and horses and everything for her to be able to go to the ball. She goes, meets the prince, they dance, fall in love of course, in a single evening. But then part of one of the caveats of the fairy godmother's spell was that it ended at midnight. As the clock starts to strike twelve, she realizes what time it is and that she's about to turn back into her peasant self. Her carriage is going to become a pumpkin and such. She just takes off out of the castle, no real explanation. Loses one of her glass slippers that the fairy godmother has given her in the process. She makes it all the way back to her house and is enjoying reliving the evening memories of it. Goes through and continues with her servant duties. And then, obviously, the prince wants to find this woman that he fell so madly in love with. And so sets out on a search through the whole kingdom to find this girl.

So the stepsisters are trying to get the shoe on in order to become the queen. And so it's not working, not working. Eventually the duke has just decided to give up and is going back to the castle. In the process, the stepmother also breaks the glass slipper that the duke had been carrying around. Cinderella eventually makes it out of the tower and comes running downstairs with the glass slipper that she still has. Shows that it still fits, or shows that it fits her.

To make peanut butter and jelly sandwich, first you need some really good, high quality sprouted grain bread, maybe something like Ezekiel's if you're still eating bread. So then you take two slices and you wanna get a nice high quality peanut butter, preferably just peanuts, maybe a little bit of salt, nice organic. And then you can spread the peanut butter on one slice. And then for your jelly, you could actually use a preserve or a fruit jam that you make yourself. So it's got really pure, high quality ingredients. And you would just place some of that on the other slice. And then you introduce the two slices to each other and you have a sandwich.

It was awkward. On my friend's birthday, she was a little bit intoxicated and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front.

Well, this is not good. And this was in high school, and back then you had to go to a school nurse first or anything. And so then she took a look at it and obviously sent me to the school doctor. And the doctor said it, it wasn't broken, it was just dislocated, and he just pulled it out and pushed it back together and put a big splint on it. Fine. And two weeks, whatever went by, I go to the doctor, and the doctor says, well, now we have to start bending this finger because otherwise it will get stiff. So I stick my hand out there and he bends it and I'm going through the roof. This is not a good thing. Oh, come on, he says, come on, this can't be hurting that much. Come on, we've got to bend it one more time. One more time I stick my hand out there and he's going nuts because he's mad because, I mean, this is hurting, but he's not having that. So he puts the band-aid back on and says, we'll come back in a week and we'll look at it again. A week later I come back and I said, come on, we've got to bend the finger again. Stick it out there. Nope, not doing it. One more time, I said, no, I'm sticking my finger out there again. We're not bending that finger anymore. And he just threw all the stuff down in disgust and said, well, get out of here. So by now, now I'm at the University of Iowa. So I go to Student Health over there and they send me to the orthopedic group there and they determine, well, there's nothing they can do. The bones are laying side by side. They've been laying side by side for so long that all they can do is cut the knuckle out and pin it back together. So you have a little shorter finger. And they put a little curve in it. And as it turns out, I believe it would have been a lot better if I just had them cut it off. Because when you make a fist, you can't bend that finger. So you don't have a lot of strength in that finger either. I think if they had cut that off, I'd have had a lot more strength. And it's just favoring that finger so much over here.

Drusilla and something. And after a few years, the father dies, and so poor Cinderella is left at the tender mercy of stepmother and the two sisters.

And so she goes crying into the garden as the two ugly stepsisters go off to the ball in the carriage.

If they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. So that's another way that an out can be generated. Let's see. The way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first, second, third, and then touches back onto home plate. That's one point, or one run. I mentioned that there's a field beyond the diamond. There's usually a fence behind those players that are in the outfield. It's called the outfield. If the batter hits the ball over that outer fence, then it's a home run. And so he gets a free, unimpeded trip around from each base, and that's a point. If the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around, and he scores a point, and then the batter gets a point. So it's a two-run home run. So you try to get more points or runs before all of your 27 outs are exhausted. If both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning, then it's kind of a sudden death, like whoever gets the most runs, where both teams equally have a chance to score runs after that, they win the game. So if you're tied in the ninth, and then the visiting team comes up first, because they start the game, they start batting, they score a run. Then they get three outs. The other team doesn't score. They get their chance. They get three outs with no runs. Then the visiting team has won the game. There's no time. The games can conceivably last forever. The only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points. Some of the strategies that people employ are you want a really good pitcher to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball. And there's different types of pitchers. There's some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow. And then you also want your defense, every position, to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm and can throw the ball to first base before that batter gets there, then they're valuable. For the offensive team, some skills that you want is you want someone that is strong, that has really good hand-eye coordination, and that can hit the ball far and hard. Some specialized players, they're skilled at speed. So if you have someone that is marginal hitting, but he's fast, and they can hit the ball, but they're fast to first base and can get there before the other team is able to get the ball, then that's a valuable position as well. That's basically the gist of the game."}, {"filename": "wright36a_723621_920178.wav", "transcript": "Cinderella and her father lived in a lovely home with her dog.

In the book that I knew when I was a child, she cleaned out cinders from the fireplace, but they don't do that anymore. But she waited on everybody. She was a servant, and the girls were top drawer in the house. And there is a picture in that book that looks as if maybe it's the king ranting and raving because his son needs to have a wife.

I asked her on numerous occasions if we could talk about it, if something was bothering her. She always said no. And then she kind of passively, aggressively started not participating in things or just kind of being rude, I guess. So it finally broke my last little straw, and I yelled at her one day and kicked her out of the group. So that's what I did about it. Well, I'm afraid of heights, even little heights, even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder. So I decided one year to get my boyfriend a skydiving thing, a jump, I guess that's what you call it, a jump for his birthday, and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights. So we went skydiving, and it was terrifying. And when we jumped out of the plane, you know you're attached to someone else, so when we jumped out of the plane and we were free-falling, I stopped breathing for like an entire minute while we were free-falling because I was just like so terrified. And then the parachute opens, and then you start gliding, which is kind of nice. That was better. It was a little bit more like being a bird, you know, and flying. So that was nice for a little bit, and then we landed, and then that was that, and I said I'm glad I did it and I'll never do it again. And I'm still afraid of heights. So the story starts with the flood. There's lots and lots of rain, which is flooding out the city, and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat to save her cat from the flood and the rains. So she got caught in the flood, she got swept downstream, and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out, and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her. Someone saw her, called the fire department, and now the firemen are there, and one of them has made his way out to the water with the life vest on and is probably going to try and strap her to him. I think that's what that looks like. To get her out of the water. And that's the end. Okay, the boy is playing soccer outside. He kicks the ball really hard. It goes crashing into the window. It crashes through the window into the lamps that's next to the man sitting there.

Well, as I grew older, I got to about my 30s, I was having problems digesting food, and I was having problems with my bite, eating, because my teeth were moving around. So anyway, I went and they suggested that I have my jaw reset, and they did. And that was quite interesting. We were in San Antonio, Texas at the time, and I went to Fort Sam, I wasn't in the military, but I went to Fort Sam Houston Hospital for the surgery to set my jaw back. And this was in the 60s, and this was just after we had landed on the moon. And well, not just after, but a few years afterwards. But anyway, they had come up with a lot of new surgical techniques in dental area, not just that area, but all other areas too. But the one thing they came up with, any time they deal with surgical procedures with the teeth or the mouth or anything like that, it can become very infectious. So they found a procedure where they put you underwater and do the surgery. I don't remember being underwater, but I do remember when I came out, the surgery they had done. Because they had moved my jaw back some, and of course they had wired my jaw closed, my mouth closed, and had me all stitched up and everything, it took about six or eight weeks before they could take the wires out of my jaw so that I could eat normally. But during that time we had a deal where my family and I always went out to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. And we did it just about every Friday night. We told the gal who ran the restaurant, we became friends of hers, and told her that I was going to have this surgery and stuff and I wouldn't be able to eat, they were going to wire my jaw. And she said, well don't worry about it, I'll just go ahead and take your meal and make you a Mexican milkshake. And she did. She put it in a blender and added some milk and put it in like a milkshake cup, and I drank it. I could take food through a straw, and I couldn't chew food, it had to be liquid.

And she sews, and sews, and sews all night on top of having to cook, and clean, and do all these other things. And when the not-so-pretty stepsisters see her, they get really mad, and they rip up her dress, and they tear off her jewelry, and Cinderella is very sad. So, off go the other girls to the ball, and Cinderella's crying until her fairy godmother comes. And the fairy godmother waves her magic wand and makes her a beautiful dress, and glass slippers, and turns a pumpkin into a, not a wagon, not a cart, I'm having a moment here. And turns the mice into beautiful horses, and off they go to the ball. And of course, the prince falls in love with her because she's so beautiful. But, the fairy godmother told her, at the stroke of midnight, it all goes away. So, just as it starts chiming midnight, she runs out the door, one of her glass slippers falls off, and she runs off into the night. So now, the prince is in love with this woman, and all he has is this little glass slipper. And so, the kingdom begins a search for the girl whose foot fits in the glass slipper. And so, when they go to Cinderella's house, the stepmother tries to sabotage it, so they won't find out that the slipper belongs to Cinderella, but of course they do, and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally, and she had a beloved cat named Fluffy. And Fluffy got chased up in the tree by a dog that lived down the street. So, her father came along and saw that she was quite upset, and he got a ladder, and he got it up and climbed up in the tree to get Fluffy down for little Sally. But when he got up there, the ladder fell, and now both Fluffy and Dad were stuck in the tree. So, they had to call the fire department, and the fire department rushed out and saved Dad and Fluffy.

Well, I think, I think, oddly enough, of meeting and continuing a life with Joe, it was, I'm sure, the most important thing that ever happened. The most memorable day was the day our son was born, but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how interesting that all was, we were students at Montclair State, and in those days, freshmen still had to wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures, and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus, we had to sing the alma mater, but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at Life Hall, and he noticed the sign and said something about, I think part of it was covered, and he said, are you a speech major? And I said, no, English, and I unveiled the words English, but he was a senior and I was a freshman, and so I got to meet one of the upper classmen, got his signature, and then later, we just had, it was an easy conversation. We just, we talked a little. He continued, whenever I saw him, I had to say hi, and people were telling me he's a BMOC. He was a vice president of student government, and I said, oh my goodness, but the more we had to talk about it, I was a student leader in my high school, and I thought when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee, but it turned out that he was interested, so our first date, I think, was something like the Kingston Trio or something like that, some folk group. It was really nice. They were on campus, and Joe had probably arranged for them to come. That was one of his duties, but when I just think of how all that unfolded, just I knew I was going to finish school, and so we paced ourselves, I guess, to be logical about things, get to know each other, no surprises along the way because you have time with a person, and you see them in all the seasons, but I think when it finally came to getting married, I don't think there was a formal, people ask us, but this was not even a formal proposal. I think everyone around us assumed we would marry, so we did, and so I wasn't engaged. I was pinned, and someone said to me the next day, you know, you're engaged to be engaged. I said, no, I'm not, and he said, well, that's what that means, and I said, oh, I thought it meant sort of going steady college style. He said, no, you're engaged to be engaged, and I said, wow, we have some time to go before I said, it means what it means to the individual couple, too, so I tried to assert myself, but I guess it might have been right, but I don't care, it didn't mean anything, but when you think of turning points in how you meet and how paths cross, that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married, and all that happened at once.

So as she was leaving, and she had glass slippers to go with her beautiful gown, and as she was leaving, she was in a really big hurry to get out of there before they could see her, and she dropped a crystal shoe, or glass shoe.

So they got to the house of Cinderella and they asked her how many girls do you have, no I only have two because they had found out what was going on that they were having to try on this glass slipper. So she hid Cinderella, of course Cinderella would stay inside her room and they tried the slipper on to the other stepdaughters and the first one was, the heel was too big so the mother said no, no it'll fit and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel but it still didn't fit. They tried on the second one but her toe was too big and the mother said no, no it fits and she cut off her toe in secret but it still didn't fit so they said no these aren't their shoes. So then they were leaving and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there, I don't remember exactly what clued them into that, so they insisted on looking around and they found Cinderella and sure enough they tried her, the shoe on her and it fit so they took her back to the castle and she married the prince and she was very forgiving, she brought her sisters to live with her."}, {"filename": "capilouto03a_588312_780052.wav", "transcript": "Yes.

Well, it shows that Cinderella meets the prince and she and the prince hit it off just great, dancing and this and that, but there was a stipulation. There was a very big stipulation that Cinderella had to be gone by the time of the stroke of midnight, that the carriage would not be there, that she would lose her gown and she would be dressed in her ordinary, just plain dowdy clothes. Well, she gets out of the castle and she just gets away from the prince and the stroke of midnight comes. She looks at herself and she's rather in her servant's clothing. Well, one of the good things about this is the slipper had fallen off her shoe, her foot, and somebody had retrieved it and taken it to the prince. And the prince sent out people all over the kingdom to find the person that that shoe fitted. And one of the people, that person, one of the searchers came and knocked at this door that Cinderella was staying at and he tries the shoe on the two daughters and, is there another girl here in this house? Yes, we have a servant here, Cinderella. But that one shoe wouldn't fit her. Of course, they know that, that shoe does, because they'd seen her wearing it. That wouldn't fit her.

And Cinderella had to get them ready. And she wanted to go, but the stepmother said no, unless she could manage everything on her own would be the only way she could go. So the little birds and the animals came to her rescue, and they helped her make a dress and everything. And so then the fairy godmother came and she fixed her a pumpkin and turned it into a coach. And the rat was the coachman and the mice were the horses.

And the other stepsisters were so disappointed because the prince didn't pay attention to them, only the strange princess that nobody knew. So a day or so later the prince went from house to house with the slipper, trying to find the girl that could wear it. And some of the stepsisters tried it on, but they couldn't get their foot into it. I think even the stepmother tried to get it on, and she couldn't get her foot in it.

But she has to be back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin. And she gets glass slippers. So she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers.

Then the next day, the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was. So they show up with the slipper at her house. And the stepmother locks her in the room, locks Cinderella in the room. And they try and fit the slipper on the stepsisters' feet, which it doesn't fit because they have big feet. And the mice steal the key and bring it into Cinderella so she can escape her room.

You have to, of course, any more they get you up, they make you move a lot, and I think I was up the first day, actually, walking up and down the hall, and then I was, I think I was in the hospital five days. I went home to my daughters, and she made sure I got up at least three times more, if she could get me up. We walked up and down the sidewalk out in front. And, anyway, after about a week, I went home and did very well. I healed fast, and it went well, and then they sent me to an oncologist who put me on chemo. He said that it's not good if you have a blood transfusion after surgery. They don't really know why in this kind of surgery, but, anyway, he put me on chemo. It was the pill form, and so I took chemo. I had to go see him every three months, and he did a CAT scan and blood work every three weeks, I mean, and, which is not too bad, except that iodine really messes your system up that they put in to do what they call a contrast when they do the CAT scan. And the chemo, there's, on the pill form, on this particular prescription, the major side effects, I didn't want nausea, but it's mouth sores and palms of your hands and the bottom of your feet blister, so I just told the oncologist I wasn't having any part of that. I didn't want it. He just kind of looked at me, but I didn't have that, and I think there's something called mind over matter, and I just decided I wasn't going to deal with it. One of the big side effects of all chemotherapy is fatigue, and another thing, which is, I really didn't have that until like the last, went to a family reunion in September, and kind of wore me out, but then the fatigue hit, and once it hit, it was really, really bad. And then I had, I have a little arthritis anyway, but I had severe joint pain and that's like, but all in all, can't complain about that. I mean, it could have been much worse, and I just was lucky that they found it. So, I think the real answer to getting better is all attitude.

But I did have breast cancer twice. That was, I have to remember, it was first diagnosed in January. I think that was in 94. And the doctor did a lumpectomy outpatient, and that worked well. And then they put me on, they tested to see what all the, what kind of cancer it is. So they put me on radiation, and first it was chemo, then radiation. And then they gave me follow-up tests for different things, but nothing showed up. So they followed me as far as exams went. And three years later, I went to the radiologist, and in his examination, he said, my goodness, I feel all lumped. It's just where the other one was. So he was in the same building as the surgeon. So they called up, and the surgeon could see me. So he looked at it, and he said, oh my goodness. So I guess within three or four days, I had a mastectomy. And that was outpatient. And what they decided to do after that was put me on, well, it's a drug they don't use any, tamoxifen. So I was on tamoxifen for five years, and I was glad to get off of that. And since then, I have had no signs of cancer. And for a while, they thought it was in my lungs, and they did a lot of testing, but it wasn't. And then they thought, oh, it's in my thyroid.

Don't you know that. So they convinced me they I they convinced me that I should probably go to the ER in case it was something more than what I thought it was. And so I did. And so I got to the ER and the doctor there, of course, did whatever they do in terms of diagnosing what had happened. And among other things, I had an MRI, I think, or CAT scan can't remember and it ended up showing that I had pancreatitis, which was totally undiagnosed and totally after I found out later talking to a doctor about it had nothing to do whatsoever with my symptoms. So I just accidentally got diagnosed with pancreatitis, spent a couple of days in the hospital. Meantime, my head had a huge lump on it and my hip from falling and nobody any doctor said one word to me about that. I was so completely kind of out of it that I didn't recognize what was going on. Why did I have these lumps? And finally, so anyway, a couple of days later, they told me I could go home from the pancreatitis and I said, so what the heck is the deal with this? And it turned out, of course, I probably did have a concussion, but it wasn't apparently serious. And so that's good. So anyway, I went home under the instructions not to drink alcohol ever again in my whole life. And I enjoyed wine a great deal, but I absolutely at that point stopped drinking entirely and haven't had any real reason to try to. I have complete and utter total fear of drinking at this point, actually. So anyway, regardless, I haven't had any other symptoms of pancreatitis and my head and my hip are fine.

All right, last for our stories, I'm gonna have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Oh boy, okay, so to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, first you need two slices of bread, and then a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of jelly, and a knife. So first, you lay the two pieces of bread out, and then you open the jar of peanut butter, and using the knife, take some peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread, of one slice of bread, and then you open the jar of jelly, and you take the knife, and you spread jelly on either on top of the peanut butter on the one slice, or you could put it on the other slice, but only on one side, and then you take the two sides that have the peanut butter and jelly, and you put them together so that there's clean bread on the outside, and that's it."}, {"filename": "NEURAL20-1_26452_211367.wav", "transcript": "Well, there was a period of time when I was approximately 48, 49 years old when I began having a series of lung collapses. And what a mysterious thing this was. But it happened exactly at the start of a menstrual period. And this happened five different times. I went each time to see the doctor and I was sent to the ER for x-rays for this lung collapse. And it was never complete. It was only about 15 to 20% of my, it was always my right lung. And so I went to the medical library at the hospital where I worked as a nurse and I spent some time trying to figure out what on earth could this be. And finally I went back to the doctor and I said, I think I know what it is. I think that I have an endometrial cyst on my diaphragm. And at the start of each menstrual period, I think it is bleeding, breaking and bleeding into my pleural cavity. Because I have found 69 examples of, I have, I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation. And the doctor said, well, you might be right. We'll send you to a surgeon. So I went to the surgeon and I said, this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery. I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had a pulmonectomy and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm, but instead he cemented the top part of my right lung to the cavity that holds it in place so that the next time I would have a bleed into this area, if that's what it was, in fact, my lung would not fall down and create a partial collapse. So that's what happened. After that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened, but I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end, the surgeon said, well, I guess that's, that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis that bled into the pleural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor. I got on birth control pills of a type such that I would no longer have menstrual periods. And it all turned out happily ever after. I had no further lung collapses."}, {"filename": "richardson58_311895_496716.wav", "transcript": "Okay, so Cinderella was, her dad ended up marrying another woman, her stepmother, and so they all moved in together with her two evil stepsisters who were very mean to her as well as the stepmom, and just gave her rags to wear and made her clean the whole house all the time and do all the chores.

The atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima. We were at home. I was upstairs, and the phone rang.

J.D. was his brother, his only brother, his only sibling. And boy, that was the first time I was aware of a death in the family. It really struck me.

There are two volcanoes, one well-known, Popocatapetl, and then the other, the Sleeping Maiden, which the warrior Popocatapetl guards. It took more than two weeks for the climbing party to get up to determine if anyone had survived. None had not survived, unfortunately.

They only separated by 11 months of age. And my father and mother had to go down to Mexico and bring my aunt and my cousins back. And in those days, you went by train. And getting across the border and coming back was not easy. The war was still on, and the wartime, which you probably can't appreciate what it was like back then, but moving across borders was really tricky. And they did bring them all back. I remember it distinctly. The family buries in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. And I can still see the large dark wood coffin, which was set in my grandparents' house in the living room, which was customary in those days, unopened, because my uncle, of course, had to be cremated, put in a little sword, which was put in a casket. My mother, grandmother being a good Methodist, believed that everybody get buried in a coffin, not little silver caskets. And that was the first death I experienced as a child.

And Cinderella, who they don't even consider as part of the family, goes into the trunks of things that probably were her mother's and makes herself a dress, which they totally destroy and tell her she's going nowhere. And she cries, and she's all upset, and her fairy godmother comes and dresses her in this beautiful dress and turns her mice into footmen and her horses into the horses for this beautiful carriage and sends her off to the ball but tells her that she has to be home before midnight. So she goes to the ball, and of course the prince falls in love at first sight, and she's all he's interested in while stepmama and stepdaughters just don't know what to do with themselves. And at five to twelve, all of a sudden, Cinderella realizes she better get home, so she goes tearing out, and as she runs away, loses one of her glass slippers and goes home, and everything disappears. The coach, everything, the beautiful dress, and all she has left is the other glass slipper. So the prince is beside himself, he decides he has to find her, so he sends one of his people out to find her with the slipper, and everybody in the realm has to try this slipper on. And of course it doesn't fit anybody because obviously she had very tiny feet. And finally they find her, she tries the slipper on, and the prince marries her and they live happily ever after."}, {"filename": "NEURAL39-1_699293_880658.wav", "transcript": "In comes the invitation to a ball, which the stepsisters are very excited about.

She got home and saw her one glass slipper and Prince was pretty upset that his lover, his pride and joy had disappeared.

So yes, she was able to put on the slipper and she lived happily ever after with her little mice. For your first prompt, I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. First, I would probably go to the store and buy peanut butter and jelly because I do not keep that here, nor do I usually keep bread. So I would go to the store, buy all of those ingredients and probably a bag of potato chips too, because I do like to put potato chips in my peanut butter and jelly. So then I would take out probably a paper plate and put two slices of bread. I do like my peanut butter first. So I would pull out a knife and I would spread the peanut butter on my left side of the bread and then I would get my strawberry jam, because I'm not a fond of grape jelly. So I would get my strawberry and I would put it on the right side and then I would open my bag of chips. I would insert some chips into the middle as well as put some on the side of the plate, close it up, probably cut it in half and then"}, {"filename": "wright19a_641860_823093.wav", "transcript": "This is a picture book telling the story of Cinderella, the book is without words so that a person can tell the story in their own way.

Once the father's gone, the sister takes advantage of Cinderella by making her do all the work and treating her like a second-class citizen in her own home, treating her two little daughters like princesses but dumping all the work on Cinderella, and she grows up finding solace in the animals around the house."}, {"filename": "NEURAL19-1_1384882_1564827.wav", "transcript": "And a while later, a messenger from the prince came, and he was making calls to the different homes in the kingdom, trying to find someone who fit the glass slipper.

I have no jelly at home, so I'd have to go to the store and buy some. And I would get raspberry that is flavored with pectin rather than sugar. Quite a really good raspberry jam. I would come home, and I would use really good multigrain bread, which I keep in the fridge. It's sprouted. And I would remove the loaf of bread from the fridge along with the jar of peanut butter. I would place it on the counter. I would take down a plate, and I would put two slices of bread on the plate. I would take a knife from the silverware drawer.

She, as it turned out, was a lovely girl. The stepsisters, of course, had faces to match their evil characters. Cinderella was kind of a dreamer. She read books, and she often imagined that some day she would be able to meet her prince and live happily ever afterwards. The family one day received a letter from the palace inviting them to a ball. And, of course, they even accepted for themselves, the mother and the stepdaughters, but not for Cinderella. She had to stay home with all these little Disney-like characters who keep flitting around her feet.

So he comes to the house of Cinderella and her bad stepmother, and they hear that he has this shoe, and he will use it to have any woman in the house try it on to see if her foot will match it.

Well, one thing that pops in my mind is when I was raising my children in my home in Waukegan, I should say our home, my husband, my first husband and I, we had in the bathroom was a crawl, not a crawl space, was a a cubicle. I don't know how to describe it. You had your linen closet and then underneath the linen closet was an open area which had a area inside of it to get to the plumbing at the bathtub. And we used that open area for a dirty clothes hamper, except there wasn't a hamper in there. And for a reason I don't remember, the children told me that there was a big animal looking out of this area. So I'm thinking, well, children. But nevertheless, I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out. And then we we went outside and we saw a raccoon or possum, I'm not sure the difference, with its big claws looking out at us from the air vents, I guess you call those, that are in the foundation of the house. And that really scared me. I thought if that thing gets in the house or gets out, it can bite the kids and it might be rabid. So I called the animal shelter, I think it was, and they told me that everybody was on lunch and so they wouldn't be there for an hour, which I blew my stack and told them that I wanted someone there now because if someone gets bit, I will sue the city. So somebody came out and the men were not happy to see this possum either because he really looked mean. And they took off the vent and somehow they caught him and then they discovered, I believe this is, they discovered a nest of baby possums, which all looked very cute when they're babies, all kinds of babies look cute.

We issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin American area. So those were some pretty exciting times. And then I was there for a few years and my direct boss, who was, he was also a senior vice president of the bank, was being sent to the Paris office. I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor. So of course, you know how romance always wins out. I had a boyfriend. I didn't want to move to Paris. And many people probably would have said Paris, you know, and like, would have been, I look back, I probably made the wrong choice, but, because the romance didn't work out either, but that's okay. So I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a little more fast moving and exciting. I figured this is a good, you know, juncture to get out of banking. It seemed very staid no matter where you were. So I got an agent. I had, you know, kind of felt my way around, you know, how things work down on the street by then. And then I ended up working for some brokerage firms. So to fast forward, hope that wasn't too long a story. Then I had my daughter. I was a stay at home mom. And the college thing was always on my mind. So I applied to Montclair State and I was accepted. I came in at the time was a second career program. And the important thing was that I did it. I got my degree and I graduated summa cum laude and I had marvelous experiences. Plus I was a day student. And that was another thing for me. I realized that I could still kind of live the life I might've when I mentioned a day student it was because I was always among young mainstream students.

I didn't really know what was wrong with me. I just thought I had a bad headache. So I went out to the kitchen and just sat there for about an hour or two. It was the middle of the night. I didn't really know what to do because I couldn't lay my head down, but I was exhausted. So I ended up going. There was someone staying in the room with me. I told him that I couldn't sleep, something was wrong with my head. He was actually a neurologist. He ended up giving me some pretty strong pills to help the pain go away. It helped through the morning, but then the next day it continued to hurt. So I ended up going to the hospital that evening. I was actually staying with three doctors. They took me to the hospital, and they checked me in. First they did a CAT scan to make sure I didn't have a tumor in my brain because they wanted to perform a lumbar puncture. If I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column, that could paralyze me. That was fine, so they ended up performing a lumbar puncture. It was a resident. It was a teaching hospital. It was UC Irvine. He didn't do a very good job at it, so the doctor who was watching him took over. It was painful, but they had given me morphine by this point, so I felt much better. I felt great, actually, really warm and fuzzy inside. I was still in the emergency room at that point. Eventually, the next morning, they got me into my own room. I felt fine by the next day, but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much. When I was 17, I was only eating one meal a day. But they said they wouldn't let me go home if I didn't eat more, so I had to eat three meals a day. They wanted to monitor me, but I felt great. I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there, and they kept me two more days. They performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go to check my white blood cell count.

No real swords or anything like that, that's not legal, but like I said, it was a reenactment. At one point during a battle, at this particular battle, he was basically tackled by several members, which isn't usual. When he fell, he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor, but they decided to step over him and they were wearing fairly large boots with heavy grids and it wrenched his neck around. They had to call the paramedics from a nearby emergency center. We were out on the outskirts of town, on the countryside of Phoenix, West Phoenix, and so the closest place was several miles away. They called the ambulance, they came out, put the neck brace on, loaded him. He was in a lot of pain. I was freaking out. I didn't know what was going on. I heard things like convulsions, I heard neck broken, I heard just, it was craziness. So they loaded him up on the ambulance. I ran back to my tent because I was out there camping with him, grabbed my car keys and hopped in the car we had taken together and met him at the emergency room. When I got there, they had him in the x-ray, taking x-rays of his neck. Turns out he did not break his neck, which was a great relief, but he was pretty badly bruised and banged up. He had severe neck whiplash and strain and was put on all sorts of pain medications and things like that. I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was, but that time in between what happened and finding out from the doctors was, yeah, I was off the charts. What do you do with that?

He got stuck and the mom, who's not in the picture, called the fire department to rescue both the dad and the cat up in the tree."}, {"filename": "richardson166_310055_485087.wav", "transcript": "So it's just Cinderella and her dad, it looks like they have a dog, and then a stepmother with her two daughters show up, and they happen to have a cat, and so they all move in to live together, and Cinderella tries to befriend the cat, and she has to kind of serve her sisters, because they're kind of lazy, I don't really know, but she does everything for them, and then, it doesn't really show that in the book, but her dad does, I guess, and then, so a letter comes, and it's about going to the ball, which I think before that, Cinderella was dreaming about the castle in the far off distance, and then the letter comes, and it's about going to the ball, to get to dance with the prince, and maybe find him a wife, and so Cinderella starts making herself a dress, and she uses a book, and she gets it all together, and then they get ready to go to the ball, and her stepsisters out of jealousy destroy her dress while her stepmother looks on very proudly about what's happening, and so then, her stepsisters head off to the ball, and the fairy godmother comes, and she makes all these wonderful things happen for Cinderella, and Cinderella gets to go to the ball, and she gets to dance with Prince Charming as her stepsisters watch enviously, and then she has to leave the ball in a hurry, because she has to be home by midnight, and she loses her little glass slipper in the process, and then the prince is, I'm not really sure what he is, but he comes around with the glass slipper, well actually, I think she gets locked up, and then her little mice friends give her a key to let her out, but while all that's happening, the little man comes with the slipper, and the stepmother is like, there's no one here, and somehow she gets out with her little key from the mice, and she ends up with Prince Charming. Alright, excellent, and last but not least for this first test, I'm going to have you tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as if I've never made one before. Okay, you're going to need peanut butter and jelly, a knife or a spoon, and then you may want a paper towel or a plate or something, and then you're going to need some bread, and I guess I'm going to make a two-slice peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so you'll have two slices of bread, and you'll take your knife or your spoon, and you'll get some peanut butter, and you'll spread it on the slice, and then with your other slice of bread, you'll use your knife or your spoon, whichever you prefer, and you'll spread some jelly on it, and then you'll put the two slices together."}, {"filename": "wright73a_730_175685.wav", "transcript": "Now here's a little girl and she has her tricycle and she's holding her hands up toward a tree. On the limb of the tree is a little cat. It's her cat and she's begging the cat to come down but the cat's holding on to that limb. But then her father must have come to see if he could help. And he had a ladder but he didn't take the ladder. He just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch but he's stuck there now because he can't get to him otherwise that branch will break and then he'll hurt himself. In the meantime, the little girl's dog comes and he's barking and barking. What are you doing up there? Come on down. I can't come up there. Another bird is taking this all in but he's singing. He's on another branch on the opposite side and he's still happy. But lo and behold, we see two firemen with a large ladder running toward the man because they're going to get the man out and certainly the cat off the branch. So they're parked and they're going in the back. But the thing is, the man should have taken the ladder and gone up safely, not the way he tried to do by himself. And the girl will get her cat back because the firemen are going to get the cat down and going to get the man down. And the little bird, he'll just stay there because he's not going to be bothered. Birds are that way. They stick to a place if they like it. And the little dog will stop barking and go home with the girl or maybe he'll go... If she goes on a tricycle, she's going to go home with the cat to make sure he's all right. And the dog will follow. And the story is, when you have your tools, make sure you use them. First, I need whole wheat bread. And there's a special bread that I like. It's called 17-grain bread. So I get the bread. I'll get two slices. I get peanut butter, and I like it with the nuts in it. So I push that around my butter spoon. And I spread it very easily on both pieces. And then I have some jelly on the side. It could be raspberry or strawberry, whatever I happen to have. I'll say raspberry. And then I just put it over it very gently so the sandwich will stick nice. And then I cover it over, and I cut it in four pieces so that it's easier to eat. Instead of holding the whole piece of bread, I hold this one piece at a time. And I know I enjoy that type of sandwich. Well, that would be my car accident back in quite a few number of years ago. And at 19... I can't give you the exact date because I have it written down with other dates that I have."}, {"filename": "wright70a_4086_178670.wav", "transcript": "To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, the first thing you have to do is go to the freezer and get the bread out of the freezer. And you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesn't dry out. And if there's only two of you in the house, you don't go through a loaf of bread a day. So it's important to keep it fresh. So you keep the bread in the freezer. So go to the freezer, grab the loaf of bread, take it out, untwist the twist tie, take out two slices of bread, put the twist tie back on, put the bread back in the freezer, close the door, grab a plate out of the cupboard and get a knife out of the silverware drawer. Now go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter. Bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter. Go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly. Put the jar of jelly on the counter. Open up the peanut butter. Take a knife, grab some peanut butter on the knife, spread it on the bread. Put the peanut butter on the whole slice of bread on one side, then put the lid back on the peanut butter. Open up the jar of jelly. Take the knife and take the other slice of bread and spread the jelly on the second slice. You never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with. So put the jelly on the other slice of bread and you find that because the bread is frozen, it's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly. After you've spread the peanut butter and the jelly, slap the two sides together, turn them over like this, cut them in half or quarters. You can cut on the diagonal, you can cut crosswise, you can cut vertical, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want. If you have a five-year-old grandson, you cut them into about eight pieces. After you've cut it, now you gotta put the peanut butter back in the cupboard, put the jelly back in the refrigerator and put the knife in the dishwasher. And now go get a glass, pour yourself a glass of milk, take the peanut butter sandwich, peanut butter jelly sandwich and the milk, sit down at the table and have a nice lunch. We have a crisis on our hands, folks. If this was the evening news, it would be reported by one of those talking heads that's very serious about everything. We have a little cat that's up in the tree and the cat belongs to a little girl. And dad has gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down, climbed up on the ladder. Something happened, the ladder fell down. Now we've got the cat and the dad up in the tree. The dog is helping by standing at the bottom of the tree, barking a lot, noise always helps. Somehow or other, the fireman found out about it and they've come and they've got a ladder and they're gonna come over and set the ladder up, get dad out of the tree and I'll probably get the cat out of the tree too. And that dad will be happy, the cat will be happy, the little girl will be especially happy and the dog will stop barking."}, {"filename": "UNH1025_2617285_2791836.wav", "transcript": "You haven't gotten those cards probably when I first passed out the seven. So you're looking at your cards and you need to try to build a hand of cards so that you will have Gin. So typically what you want to start with is if you have any pairs to start with, those are good. So you might want to put those over on one side. If it looks like you're starting a run, you know like if you have the Queen of Hearts and the Nine of Hearts and the Ten, then you know all you need is a Jack. So once we've gotten our hands all organized, we flip over the top card and then we've decided that you're going first because I was the dealer. So you look at that card and you look at what's in your hand and you decide if that card will help you at all as you're trying to build your Gin hand. If it looks like it would go with what you have, you take it and you put it in and you have to discard one of your cards because you never have more than seven cards in your hand. And then it's my turn. If I want the card that you discarded, I can take that and then I discard one. If you want the one that I just discarded, you can take that. We can go back and forth and back and forth, but eventually one of us is going to want something other than what was put down there. So you flip the next card over or you have to take, so if you don't take that, the next card on the deck, you have to take it. It's your turn. Okay, so we go back and forth that way, back and forth, back and forth. Eventually one of us is going to have created a hand of gin. And so what you'll have is you will have picked up a card, let's say it's the one you've been waiting for. Into your hand it goes and you've been holding onto this one extra card over here that you really don't need. And you take that card and you put it face down on the pile and you see gin. And then the person screams because they realize that you had the cards they needed all along. And then the way it's scored is you have to lay your cards out. If you have three of a kind, then you put that over to the side. If you have four in a row, you put that over to the side. Anything that you have that's left over that didn't fit into your hand of gin, you have to, we count up what that card is worth and that goes on your score. And then we play another hand until we get tired of playing the game. And the person with the lowest score wins the game."}, {"filename": "wright25a_250_174773.wav", "transcript": "OK? While preparing for Tommy's birthday party, their dog Spot jumped up on the table and ate part of the birthday cake, running under the couch because the mother was angry with the dog.

Tommy was very sad that his dog Spot had eaten some of his cake, but he told his guests it was OK, and they had brought him nice gifts. And they went to Chuck E. Cheese and had a different cake that was better than the first one. The end. First, you get two pieces of bread, and a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of jelly, and a knife. You take one piece of bread, taking peanut butter on the knife, covering one side of the bread. Then you take the knife, filling it with jelly, and cover the other piece of bread on one side. Putting the two pieces of bread together with peanut butter and jelly, you've successfully made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When I was five years old, I had tonsillitis and had to have my tonsils removed. It was very scary because I was young, and I wasn't able to breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become sore and aggravated. So I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out. The best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better. But afterwards, going home, I had to take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better, which gave me vivid dreams. And I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo. And when I woke up screaming, my mother had come in to take care of me. And it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake. And apparently, that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy. After about a week, I got better. And I was happy that I never had to do that again. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? Yes. Please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it. I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired. And in order to work with her and explain directions and meet with her on a regular basis, we went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from my speech into sign language to explain what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates, meetings, et cetera. In addition, we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily to get around any communication barriers that we had because of her hearing impairment."}, {"filename": "wright69a_95780_270070.wav", "transcript": "Well, yes, I remember being hospitalized. The most recent one was in New York City. I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt Hospital. And my right lung had filled up with fluid, and so they kept me. And I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital, because the staff seemed overworked. The towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower. They didn't come, so I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel. I have veins that are very difficult to get blood. So I'd always say kiddingly to the people, are you really good at this? And one man named Joe L. told me he was terrific. No problem. After about 20 pokes in my hand, I said, could you find someone else to draw blood? Because we're not getting it done here. And it was really all I could do to get better so I could get out of the place. Because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid, and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need. I can also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night. Of course, I wasn't breathing, and I was hacking and doing all these things. And she couldn't find the bathroom, so she just used whatever facility she could find. And when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient that's dying. So I was so unaccustomed to hospitals. And I'm probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before. And I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there. So that was my experience. That's probably the worst experience I've ever had in the hospital because everything else has always been done very well. It was crazy.

About 5 o'clock I told the wife we're going to have to go to the emergency room and that's really weird for me to do that. So I went to the emergency room and the nurse checked me out and put some lubricant in my eye to give me a pain pill, excuse me, and she called the doctor and the doctor called when I got home, made arrangements to meet her at the office. So we got down to the office and she checked my eye out again with another machine and said it was just a rub mark, it wasn't a scratch or a tear or anything, the lubricant would work. So she gave us a prescription for the lubricant. We get down to the drugist and it was for somebody else's name, another patient's name. Well the first drug store we went to, it wasn't covered, it was a Walgreens, but it's not the Walgreens that we normally go to, and they wouldn't honor the prescription. So they suggested that we get an over-the-counter lubricant, which didn't have any antibiotics in it. So I was reluctant to mix them. So we got home, we called the doctor again, and that was, say, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock. And by the time we finally got a call back from the doctor, I had to call twice through a service. When she finally called back, she laughed. She said, oh, I should have known that. So what she did, that was around 6 o'clock, so what she did was called in another prescription to a different Walgreens. That's about 30 miles away from home. The wife went back up there again and unfortunately the doctor had called in another name, a third name, but it was close enough to the Bridewell name that the druggist there recognized my name. They hadn't filled the prescription, because they weren't positive, but they held onto the prescription until the wife got there, and then they worked it out. Well, they went on and filled the prescription for us. She brought it back home, and, well, I put another noose in there before I went to bed. I took another pill, and when I got up the next morning, it was all but cured. So last night, meaning Sunday night, was the last time I took any of the lubricant.

I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather because he was one of the most important people in my life when I was a child. It was the summer when I was going into kindergarten, it was in July, and it was just a normal day. I was a happy, carefree child playing with my friend down the street, and it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom. You went out the door and came in for lunch, and then you went out the door, and there really weren't very many parameters, and there were lots of fun adventures to be had. And I came home to find out that he had had a, they didn't use the word stroke, but that's what he had, that he had to go to the hospital from work. And so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying, when grandpa comes home, he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning I remember waking up, and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like. I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that he wasn't coming home, and just as a child, an innocent child, kind of coming to terms with life and death, saying, wow, and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And I had, my four sisters were there, and my cousin who was in the nursing home, she was around because she kind of lived with us for a while. And it was just, she actually, I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard. Everyone went to, all the adults went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that. And I was hysterical crying. I was so, so sad. And she didn't know what to do, so she actually slapped me to get me, and it worked. She wasn't being mean. But I was beyond being consoled at that point. And I felt very alone in my grief for some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather. But anyway, that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future. And I remember a time when I was in sixth grade, and we were having a sleepover in my friend's backyard. Happened to be with a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots, a girl who lost her young brother to leukemia. The other girl had lost her grandmother, and I had lost my grandfather. And it was like they could make a movie about the bond. We were all in the tent, and we were just talking, and you can see us all sitting there. And we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life. And we put it out there. It was probably the safest place to ever let it go. And we all just let it out. And I remember feeling so empowered by that, and finally feeling like I could share this, and it's a good thing. So that's why I think this story is so important to me, is because it was something that affected my life, you know, as I grew up. And also, as I had mentioned yesterday, that I didn't know about angels then, but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe, and he can sort of watch over me, if you will."}, {"filename": "wright09a_1070027_1243501.wav", "transcript": "One day, a family of mouses went on a picnic.

He knew that whoever the slipper fit was gonna be the girl who he had fallen in love with at the dance or at the ball. The two girls, the two stepsisters, tried to fit their feet into the slipper, but their feet were too big. And the servant said, isn't there anyone else? I've searched all the houses. There's gotta be somebody else. And just then Cinderella appeared in her work dress. And he says, ah, here's another girl. She needs to try on the slipper too. So Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper and it slid in very easily. And she smiled and the servant smiled and said, ah, at last I found you. And he brought Cinderella back to the castle while the sisters stared after her with anger in their eyes. The prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella. They got married. Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them. And she was kind to them. And they all lived, and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her.

We flew to Copenhagen. We spent an extra day, had a wonderful time, and feel we must go back, we can never figure out how and when. Picked up our cruise boat on a Sunday, from, got to meet people, met most of our dinner companions, very, very nice, very compatible. As we were traveling with friends, we decided we better set up our side trips. Our first trip was London, where we had been before, but our friends hadn't been. Did a wonderful trip of seeing the highlights, high points of there, and then they dropped us off at Covenant Garden, for a couple of hours. We grabbed a bite and meandered. Prices being what they are, we really didn't buy much, but enjoyed ourselves. The trip both for Paris and London, the ports are two hours by bus from each of them, so we enjoyed countryside scene. Following day was Paris, took a tour of the city, and a three hour boat ride on the Seine. Again, it was our first trip, and their first trip to Paris. Again, a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time. From there, we had a day at sea, enjoyed lazing around. The ship itself, I would not particularly recommend, but enjoyed being with the people we were with. From there, we spent a few hours in Vigo, Spain. I haven't figured out yet why they stopped there. From Lisbon, it's again a city we had been to before. Our friends had not, enjoyed a tour of the city, spent some time meandering in the square, and of course, finding some pastry. My husband's favorite. From there, we went to Cadiz, Cadiz, then Malaga, a very nice city, very friendly people, interesting architecture. Back to Genoa, and then on to Genoa, where we spent a night, and then flew home. We'll leave the airplane trip back in the realm of nightmares, at least from Charlotte to Phoenix on U.S. Air, and don't ever ask me to fly U.S. Air again.

I guess to describe a particularly happy or sad event in my life, I'd select a recent one. Back in mid-February, my daughter left, flew out of Cincinnati, Ohio, actually in Kentucky, Greater Cincinnati Area Airport to Frankfurt, Germany to begin her studies in Heidelberg, Germany. Her flight left about 11 o'clock in the morning. My wife and I then drove her up to Cincinnati. It was both a very happy time and also a very sad time. Happy because she was leaving and going on to this new stage in her life. Sad because she is our only child and she's lived close to us all of her life. But it was very good to get back and visit her over spring break to know that she's doing well and enjoying herself.

Anything past eight centimeters is a separation. Anything less is a dislocation, and mine was at seven. So seven centimeters separated. I still have it to this day, a little bump that has formed from it.

And again, this can be the same example you used last week or it can be a different example. Well, my mother's the one that comes to mind and we FaceTimed a couple of days ago, I guess it was Friday. And what was interesting is she does not remember from day to day or even minute to minute what has happened, but it's clear she can still acquire skills because she's gotten better at holding the little phone or iPad in front of her. She managed to keep it on her face this week or last week. So often she, but the conversation was the same, which is she's delight always in the moment and happy to see me, but cannot follow a conversation very well, forgets what you've asked. And actually I've just stopped asking her questions, but rather sort of prompting her with ideas or words or whatever. Sometimes I ask questions, but not all the time. But her memory is much like, there's just no beginning or end. I think the metaphor I used last week is that she'll look through a series of pictures endlessly and make relatively the same comments. So mostly if she starts talking and she talks less than she used to, I'll redirect if she gets into something that is agitating to her or kind of super sad if she keeps repeating it, but that doesn't happen very often. Most of the time she kind of discovers anew that she's talking to people. Like you can see her look away and then she'll look at the screen and kind of, oh, hi, delighted to see you. So she's getting a little better at understanding that she seems to be able to remember that she's done something like this before and that if she looks in a certain place, we can see her and she can see us. And that her memory has been, fading over the last decade, but looking back, I realized she had trouble even before then, but had better coping skills and it was manageable. She made a lot of lists. She relied on my father who was then still alive to prompt her for things. So the decline has been steady and longer than we thought at the beginning, but she seems very happy to be in the moment.

Once you got the ingredients, you get out a plate and you put it on the table and you grab two slices of bread. Put the bread on the plate and you open up your jars and you grab one butter knife for your peanut butter. You take and you spread the peanut butter on both pieces of bread, both pieces. You gotta make sure you get enough peanut butter. And then you take and you grab a spoon and you get the jelly. I prefer strawberry jam, but you get a nice scoop of jam or jelly on there and you put it on the bread and you smear it out. And then you take and you put the two halves together and then you can cut it into half or you can cut it into fourths.

But I had a really, really crazy time in college and I kind of knew that like that chapter was closing and something new was opening, but I was like, I didn't know where to begin. And so I was in the Haverhill Public Library and I swear by this, the book fell off the shelf. Like I didn't touch this book, like this book fell off the shelf. And it was called Spirit Junkie by this woman named Gabrielle Bernstein. And I opened up that book and my whole life changed after that. She broke down the gift of healing, of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I had never heard of. I mean, I went to a Catholic school and it was kind of like religion is like politics and it's not for me. And she just opened up this door that you can heal through this way of prayer and of asking for help. It was something that was so foreign to me to just ask for help. And so I started doing her writing exercises. I started doing her meditations. Like I just threw myself into this lifestyle. I started praying every night, I started praying every morning. And I started noticing that my life was getting lighter, that I was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have before because I was blocking myself and she was showing me this block. So picking up that book and dedicating myself to spirituality and the biggest thing being meditation. She had no exception. She wasn't like, oh, you don't really meditate? Like do two minutes. She was like, sit down for five minutes. You have time for this. This is so important. And that book led me to daily prayer, to meditations, to traveling far beyond what I ever thought that I was brave enough to do. That led me to India where I became a yoga teacher. It's led me to meet Gabrielle Bernstein on several occasions. I listen to her podcast regularly. I share her message. And I swear, I've been on this earth for 24 years but I didn't start living until two years ago when I found that book on the shelf. Now I think about my job and how I can get backed up in people and how I keep traveling, and how I can care for my family and how I can care for the people that I love. But the number one priority above starting a family or starting a career is to continue this meditation practice and to give this peace back to the earth and just make that my foundation, this place of peace and meditation.

So the dad decides that he's going to rescue the cat, Scruffy, by getting the ladder and climbing up there, so as he gets the ladder, puts it against the tree, the dog, Sparky, came over and actually knocked the ladder down, so not only was the cat, Scruffy, in the tree, but the dad was too, so meanwhile, someone had to call the fire department to come and help, because the dad was too far up, it's too high to jump, he can't climb down, because there's only a few branches, so the firefighters are on their way to come and save the day, not only are they gonna save dad, but they're also gonna save the little cat, Scruffy."}, {"filename": "capilouto67a_344872_509196.wav", "transcript": "uh... really just rest and walking around uh... during that period of time obviously I wasn't in school so my aunt was doing home schooling for me if you wanted to keep me uh... right up with the class so I never did miss any schooling in my class and when I was able to go back to school I picked up right where I left off if you will or right where they were at that time but basically nothing had healed itself when I went to the doctor we lived about three or four blocks from the doctor and at that time I was using these crutches to walk around on but prior to going to the doctor I was playing in the doing something in one room and I got up and I walked over to the other side of the room to pick up something that was the first time I'd walked without crutches for ever for six, seven, eight weeks and it was very miraculous that I could do that so anyway we went to the doctor that afternoon when we got to his office we walked in the door and my aunt said show him what you can do so I put the crutches on the ground and I walked over to his desk and he said that's absolutely astounding he said I did everything I could do to help you but he said we had a little bit of help from somewhere other than what I could do and from that moment on till today I've not had any problem except occasionally since it was a tender area I was not able to wear high boots or high shoes because it would irritate it to the point where it would heal but uh... we finally got over that and I went through the service, I wore combat boots and didn't have any problem at all and I've never had any problem since that time uh... never had any limping or anything else it was foreshortened by about maybe half an inch but my body adjusted to it and my right leg bowed enough so that I never had a limp but that did create a problem where I had to have a knee replaced a few years ago because of the angle and the pressure on that knee caused by this over the years but at eighty-two I'm still having no problem when I was fifty I would run around the block every day in the morning when I got up but lately I haven't been able to do it, I haven't done it really, I haven't done it too much I walk the dog now and that's about the extent of it but that is what happened to me back in the thirties that I remember well"}, {"filename": "capilouto60a_313136_477304.wav", "transcript": "I had an operation.

The fire department came, and with any luck, they will be able to put their ladder against the tree, and get dad back off out of the tree, and I think the cat will be up there until it feels like coming down.

And then I started to realize what I was having was a severe form of my IBS, which I have very seldom, but occasionally, which causes, the pain causes me to pass out. So, I tried to find my particular little pills that cut down on those stomach cramps and I couldn't find them. Unfortunately, I was standing at the time, so I passed out from a standing position down onto our hardwood floor, scared my husband to death.

He did not have a coach at the ready, being in his own palace and all. But he has the shoe, and he looks at the shoe, and it's very delicate and tiny. And he thinks, I have a clue, and I shall not rest till I find this woman, because truly, she's the hottest lady I've ever seen. It's got to be her, nobody else. So he sets off the next day to Torrey's kingdom, which is actually quite modest, but still kingdom. And goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person, every woman of eligible age. And it doesn't fit any of them, because they all have gigantic extra wide feet, which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason.

So he calls her over, and the stepmother the whole time is like, no, no, it couldn't be her. She's just a gutter wench. You don't want anything to do with her. She's dumb. She's ugly. She's infertile. Why not consider one of my daughters? They might not be your first choice, but they're a pretty good second bet. The prince continues to wave her away, and he approaches Cinderella, and he asks her to try on the shoe. And she does, and of course it fits. And he thinks, good enough for me.

I discovered this when I was talking on the telephone, working at the office, had the telephone up like this, on this ear, so I can write like this, take notes. It was a fairly long phone call, I get a stiff neck. So I switched the telephone around to the other side, and the volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to this side, and it was much quieter. So I figured there's something wrong with the ear, my left ear is not hearing the way it should. Anyway, I went to an ENT specialist, and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma, which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull. We did some research, found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery. I went out, had the surgery performed. For the surgery itself, first thing I do is shave this side of your head. I got a haircut before I went out, so it would be short, so I wouldn't look like I had real long hair on this side. I remember the prep, I remember the shaving for the surgery. Then you're under, you're totally out of it. I didn't wake up and have consciousness until what I think was the second day following the surgery. They keep you out because they don't want you moving around. The surgery involves cutting a hole in the head so they can get into where the nerves are, get the tumor taken off of it. Afterwards, it was a recovery that took, oh, a week or 10 days before we recovered enough to be able to come back home. I had a nice scar up this side of the head, kind of shaped like a light bulb. They put a Steri-Tape on it to kind of hide it, keep it sterile. The nice part about heading back was we'd go to the airport and I'd sit in the chair and I'd sit so that that side of my head was toward the ticket counter. My wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say, my husband's had some brain surgery and he's not feeling very good. Is there any possibility that we could move up to first class? And everybody would take a look at me, slumped over, looking half dead, this big scar running up the side of my head. We got moved up to first class on every flight.

So they lived, you know, happily for a while, and she cooked their meals and cleaned their house, and they went off to work every day. And meanwhile, the queen discovered, using her mirror, that she was still not the fairest in the land, and Snow White was still alive, so she decided to disguise herself as a witch. And, um, because I asked you to, um, she decided to disguise herself as a witch and take a poisoned apple, um, to get Snow White to eat. Um, so yes, the queen disguised herself as a witch and came to the little house, and while the dwarves were away at work, and got Snow White to eat an apple that was poisoned, and she fell into deep sleep, and they thought that she had died. And the, um, the dwarves came home and discovered it and were heartbroken. And while they were holding her funeral, the prince came along and kissed her, and she coughed up the apple and awoke from the spell.

So take a look at all of them, and then I'd like you to tell me a story about what you see with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Little boy was going off to school, and his mom told him to take an umbrella with him because it was supposed to rain. And the little boy said, no, mom, I don't need an umbrella, it's not gonna rain today. And mom said, okay, you can go, but it's gonna rain. And he went outside and it started raining, and he turned around and came back. And he's like, oh, I should have listened to you the first time, mom.

So she was trying to tell the cat that it was okay, jump down, let me help you, but she couldn't get the cat out of the tree. So she got her dad who brought a ladder, and the dad climbed up the tree, and the ladder fell down so he couldn't get down again. And the cat and the dad were stuck in the tree.

And, but also that I would immediately need to stop drinking alcohol completely and that I should be aware that drinking alcohol would do one of two things, either kill me or give me type one diabetes. Neither of which sounded really good options to me. So yes, at that point I stopped drinking alcohol completely and have not had any recurrence of that.

She had danced, I guess, with the prince and made a pretty good impression on him, according to the story.

My favorite peanut butter can be of any brand, but I like the chunky style. Because I eat a lot of peanuts, I eat a lot of almonds. I just eat them for the nutritional value. So I do eat considerable peanut butter. From a sandwich standpoint, it's a little bit different for me to even think of eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I usually eat most of my peanut butter on saltine crackers. But in the case that I am really, really hungry and I'm not just eating a snack, then I would, after locating my peanut butter, place it out on the counter. I will then go and find some bread. Sometimes I keep my bread in the refrigerator so it doesn't mold so quick. And if I had done that, I would usually toast the bread because I don't like it to be cold when I eat it. Otherwise, I may have taken it off the counter. For my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread because that would give me the extra flavor of the crust. So once I've located my bread, I now have my peanut butter. I would go to my drawer where I keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife or a dinner type knife and begin spreading the peanut butter onto the bread. What I like to do in here, this is where the jelly messes you up, is that when I make, I usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of the, well on one side, but on both slices of bread. In this case, I have to go and alter my plan and have them put the peanut butter only onto one piece of bread and I would use the jelly on the other. Now, since I don't have a whole lot of jelly in my house, I do keep at least one bottle or jar, whatever you call it, in my refrigerator and it will usually always be strawberry because I just like strawberry and it's just like a, it's a good default jelly. So after I got that out of the refrigerator, I would do the same with that, putting it onto one slice of bread and then smashing them together and eating it and enjoying it."}, {"filename": "NEURAL6-2_952469_1110056.wav", "transcript": "My dad learned a lot of German, but I just barely learned some.

And very different part of France than you usually think of because it's much more like, it's in the low country, so it's much more like Holland or Belgium up there. And in terms of architecture, in terms of the people, they're much less stereotypical French people up there. In other words, let me give you an example. In France, in Paris, and certainly in Southern France, people are very loath to wait in line. People cut in line, they end up in this great big, huge mob instead of lines. And it's frustrating for people who are lined standers by nature, which Americans tend to be and British tends to be, but French don't usually, except up in Northern France, they are also. Because again, they're much more like the Dutch. So anyway, it was awesome. We lived in an apartment on the top floor of a five-floor apartment building. And we had a beautiful, they call it terrasse, which is essentially a patio type thing outside with lots of space. And we had a table out there. The street that we lived on had been a canal up until the 1930s when it was filled in and they made a large avenue out of it. So it was much, much wider than normal avenues, even avenues are in French cities. So it was spacious and beautiful. And I made friends. We did wonderful, a lot of traveling at that point, a lot of traveling in France, but also in other countries in Europe, because that was John's job partly. He went to England a lot, went to Denmark, Spain. Germany, not really. I forget why we didn't go to Germany very much, but anyhow, it was amazing.

So I did do that. I came home on emergency leave and visited with her, and at the time, she could give yes and no answers, but it was very difficult for her to construct a sentence at that time. And then I wasn't around her every day, not even really every month. I was off, you know, in the service, and my dad basically was the caregiver. And she just slowly would go down, and it would be kind of a plateau. I would get down to see her, and eventually she got to the point where she couldn't say anything, and you never really know. So I would try to talk to her about how she was doing and some experience that the kids were having or something like that. And at first, you thought she maybe was relating to it, but later, you really didn't know whether it was getting through at all. The best was about 1980, and then about five years later, four and a half or so years later, my dad had coped with everything from that time. It about killed him because he was, you know, approaching 80 or in his early 80s. He thought it was time for her to go into a nursing home, and my brother and I went down to town from up here. I was up in Scott County at the time, but my brother was here in Lexington. We drove down and were going to help him get her into the nursing home because he just couldn't do it.

But there was contention from the get-go. The mother of the girls treated Cinderella like a maid. It was somebody that she could use as a servant while her girls had lessons and got dresses made. Life was really good for the girls and for the mother. Who knows where the man was? He wasn't paying attention, and so Cinderella had to have friends with mice and crickets and whatever all. And then the community decided to have a ball because they had a prince that needed a woman. And so everybody was going to go to the ball except Cinderella, because she's the cleaning girl and she has to clean the ashes out of the fireplace, etc. So, of course, we're back to manifesting. Cinderella knows how to manifest, and so she manifests as a fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother has a wand, and she's going to create a dress and wonderful glass slippers for the girl, but we don't tell anybody because she'd get locked up and not be allowed to go. While the sisters, who aren't the most conventionally attractive girls, go to the ball. Cinderella gets to go when the fairy godmother makes her pumpkin into a carriage. And so she goes to the ball. And, of course, the prince pays attention to her because she's got this glow about her because not everything is of this earth. And he decides that this is the one he chooses, but Cinderella remembers she has to be home before midnight because she's going to return to the scullery maid, and the pumpkin's going to lose its wheels and the horses will end up being mice again. And so that's what happens, and she barely makes it home in time to serve breakfast the next morning when the town crier goes from house to house to try to find who matches the glass slipper that got left behind.

And we got, we ended up getting divorced, however after my divorce I went to a seminar at a place called Landmark Education and I learned about, it was a weekend seminar, it's started on Friday morning and went through Sunday night. There was about 125 of us there, it was about 15 men and 100 some odd women, mostly, maybe not exactly that, but it was that kind of proportion. And I was, I had felt very, kind of down after my divorce and I had prayed and this was kind of the Lord leading me to this session. So I listened and I listened a lot and the conversation dealt with abandonment and it turns out that, in summary, I think most women, I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do. And I learned very significant things about abandonment and how people feel and learn that you have to forgive in abandonment. But I also learned that, which this was reinforced, I was told by a priest back in the 70s that when your wife speaks to you, just listen. And when you remember one or two things as what's important, don't solve every problem. Well this reinforced that and it's very, women have, that's why if you go back to that story I might have said this. Men have a need, men do too, but they don't verbalize it, but women verbalize it a lot more. When things build up after a day, they have a need to come home and dump, they do. And they need somebody to listen, they don't need any dialogue on it or not, but they need somebody to listen. So I learned to just sit and listen and what I remembered from it is that afterwards, after your partner's finished, what you remember, one or two things, you talk about that and then your partner is pleased because then that shows that you've listened to them.

And of course, she had the arguing with my dad dynamic going on, so she pretty much tried to hide it for years. But eventually, you know, it was, they didn't really diagnose it for a while and then she went to University of Michigan where they have this neurology or aphasia center, some type of where they do a lot of research in it. Thing is, she didn't like the doctor and she told him to fuck off and whatever. So didn't really get the whole research thing on it. But over time, she, you know, just got less and less communicative. They thought she was having mini strokes for a while. And what really got her pissed off was, it was actually the evening of her sister's funeral. They went out to dinner and she passed out and they rushed her to the hospital. And the doctor, well, the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital, after she woke up that evening, she was talking perfectly normal. I mean, it had gone away. She had full sentences and it was as if nothing happened. I take the clock back 10 years. She went to bed that night, she woke up and then she was back to where she was before it happened. So no one could figure that one out. But meanwhile, the doctor pulled her driver's license because she passed out and, you know, considered a seizure or something. And that really pissed her off. And she took her, my dad had to take away the keys. She actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up. And we actually kept her car until she died. She couldn't sell her car because, you know, when you get better, mom, you can have her car back. But eventually she ended up losing muscle control and, you know, she was working with a walker. And then within a year after that, she was in a wheelchair. She was in the nursing home for about the last year and a half. And when she went in the nursing home, she could still speak three or four sentences, three or four word sentences. And towards the end, she could get, you know, one or two words out.

And it buzzed and he cut into the plaster of Paris and you could hear it grinding away. The next thing I know, he holds up two halves and says, here's your cast. You can have it as a souvenir. So I said, wow, that's great. That's cool. So I took it home and kept it for many years. And the leg healed fine."}, {"filename": "NEURAL39-2_501602_653911.wav", "transcript": "but all turned out fine. So I guess that was the most dramatic and luckily that was what a year, almost a year and a half ago. So I haven't had anything major since. Wonderful. Now I'd like you to take a look at this series of pictures. They tell a story and then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. The beginning, there is a young lad outside playing soccer, playing around, looks like by himself. Middle of the story is the soccer ball goes through the window into the family room of a neighbor. I'm gonna call it a neighbor who was very surprised. End of the story is once again, the neighbor decides to keep the ball and does not go after the little boy, the young. So here's some more pictures that tell a story. Please take a look at all of them. And then I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. The beginning of the story, the little boy is heading out to school. I see a backpack on his back and mom hands him an umbrella to let him know that it's getting ready to rain. It will be raining somewhere during the day. I assume he attended class and was walking home. Middle of the story is in the way home. He gets drenched. It starts raining and he is soaking wet. End of the story is he's a little perturbed that his mom was correct. And moral of the story at the end is he took his umbrella with him next time he went out. I'd like you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. And I'd like you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. I would say the beginning of the story is the little girl was out riding her bicycle when she happened to notice that her cat had climbed the tree and had gotten stuck. Middle of the story, I would say dad came up and decided he was gonna try to help out the kitty cat and he as well got stuck. End of the story would be the fire department was called to come rescue both of them.

But because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing, the communication never developed. Two years after the man was fired, the captain, he came back to that area by himself, his wife and his children, and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the U.S. government even more angry. So I still remember this day thinking the U.S. wanted to keep Japan as friends, the Japanese wanted to keep the U.S. as friends, but what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble, stupid. When my wife was seven months pregnant, we got news from her family that her mother-in-law was dying of intestinal cancer. We were living away from them at the time, we were living in Japan, excuse me, we were living in Germany, but they were back home in Japan. My wife's pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late-term pregnancy, and it was her first child. So I had to go back to represent her, in the Japanese mind anyway, for my wife and I, to see the mother-in-law. In a period of three months, I went five times, balancing my lectures on this funny German schedule I told you about. The biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die. I talked to the doctor, but the father didn't know. They kept that information from the father. They didn't want to tell him. I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family, not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying. The mother didn't know she was dying. So I was afraid that my wife couldn't get home. The sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary, and I will never be able to answer that question of what if.

So then after they had left, she was dreaming. OK, and in her dreams, somehow she got a nice dress. And a team came by to get her, a team of horses with a pumpkin was what the carriage looked like.

The carriage had already disintegrated. She was sitting on a little pumpkin. Ultimately, she gets home, back to wherever she was working. I'm assuming that she was some kind of a maid or something. Anyway, then it appears as if the prince's father or his servant came over with a slipper. And he was searching for whoever the slipper would fit. And he tried the other sisters or other people who lived in the house. I forget now whether it was her sisters or whether she was just a maid for them. And she tried all of them. And it didn't work.

My mother's disability is apraxia aphasia, and so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across. What I do is I offer her extra time. Sometimes extra processing time helps. Sometimes we can do a pantomime with, is it this touch, if it's an object, maybe we can pull the object like a cell phone or whatever. Sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a little better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it. And then because we lived with each other and we're together so much, I can kind of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs. Like today, I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card. So for the most part, I can kind of guess. So a little bit like Vanna White, is it this, is it that, does it begin with the letter? Sometimes beginning letters help. So that's how we work it out. My husband and I were in Washington, D.C. doing some sightseeing and it turned, when we came off a boat trip, it got a little darker and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel. And so we were walking along, it was a pretty isolated street. There wasn't a lot of people around. We're trying to get to a bus stop or a station. And as we were walking, we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us, maybe 20 yards back. It was three young kids, three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough. And so I was very, I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heart beat racing. And my husband said, if they come after us, I'm going to take the movie camera and I'll hit them and you run like hell. So we were picking up the pace as we picked up the pace. They picked up the pace and as we turned the corner, there was a bus station and people were waiting there. So we were just so grateful to see other people and they backed off and they left us alone.

So she started to get everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball. And in the meantime, her friends, the mice, sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could go to the ball. Once she got everybody off and going, she can then get ready and go. But the sisters found out and they tore up her dress and she thought she'd never get to the ball. And then she met her fairy godmother. She went out in the yard and was crying and the fairy godmother came. And the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the mice into horses and the dog into a horseman and gave her a beautiful dress and sent her off to the ball, but told her that she needed to be home by 12 o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point. So she went off to the ball and she met the prince and they fell in love. And all of a sudden she heard the clock chiming 12 midnight. So she had to run out and she ran down the steps of the castle and left the prince and she lost her shoe on the way.

Another milestone was getting a job at Montclair State. I was a speech clinician doing work as a speech language pathologist, but I missed interacting with students. I had some experience in doing that because my undergraduate degree was in history, and I actually did student teach at a high school in history, and had planned to do that, but then things sort of changed, obviously. But I missed that kind of interaction. I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician, and Marie was teaching English at the high school level, and she would come back home with stories about working with students and discussions they had in class, and I was sort of jealous of that. And so when I was invited to become an instructor, here, I jumped at the chance, and that changed everything. And I was warned from friends, colleagues, that I was taking a big risk in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure, that I was going to be taken advantage of. I don't know where they got the idea, but that I would work for X number of years, and when it came time for tenure, I wouldn't get tenure. But I wanted to be in the classroom so much, and it was more that than doing research, actually. It was actually teaching that drew me to it that I said, oh, the heck with it, I'm going to do it, and so I did, and that changed everything, and that was a very, very positive event.

I'm trying to think of something happy now. Those are two sad stories, kind of happy endings. Oh, okay, I'll tell you about a girl's weekend. Start, okay, so I have a good friend. We started way back. We've lived all over the country and our lives have kind of paralleled each other until when I was in Massachusetts and she was in Virginia. So anyway, we would meet once a year. We both now, well, we were always married when we knew each other and now we have kids and kids, they were middle school age. We started these girls weekends and it became an annual thing and typically we went to Philadelphia. We would drive or fly into Philadelphia. We met there or sometimes Baltimore and they would always start the first night. It would be like up late, which every time we said, we're not gonna do it because it always killed our first full day together, but we'd be up late and we would just drag the hotel chairs in front of a window and wine and we would pack cheese and crackers and grapes. Whoever drove brought, packed whatever they could. The other person would pick up a bottle of wine from the liquor store on the way in. Anyway, we would sit the evening and catch up and then the next day we would get up and have a delicious breakfast out or just a cup of coffee and then we would go and in Philadelphia, there was this first time, which then became a tradition. We stumbled upon the store. We couldn't figure out the lighting was a little weird. The flooring was a little off. Anyway, it turned out to be a great consignment shop and unbelievable clothes. I mean, like just unbelievable clothes. We would spend hours in there. We would try on and we'd go home with bags and then we'd bring those back to the hotel and then we'd go out for our happy hours somewhere and then we'd go out for dinners. No kids, no cooking. And then sometimes on some of the weekends we would do, typically the weekend enough was too expensive. So we would just do like a treatment, like a facial somewhere. The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became. So we'd go for like a facial or something and then on Sunday, we would always go out for our breakfast again and then whoever had the car would drive the other one to the airport. That was it.

Anyway, it was a 16 bed, short term crisis unit. So two weeks or more, and they either pull their act together or they got shipped off to Capital District Psychiatric Center. So that was the huge motivation for them to be earnest in their endeavors. So it was a mental health population. So depending on the diagnosis and where they were that day, depended on how communicative they could be or chose to be. We had all sorts, all sorts, and depending on their age and depending on their diagnosis and depending what was happening, there was a certain percentage of population that were chronically mentally ill. So we did have repeat, repeat people, not all old, a lot, you know, late 80s, so a lot of the psych hospitals were starting to close down if they had been compliant with their meds. So we did a lot of listening, a lot of urging, sometimes just quietly sitting with them. And sometimes that was the best thing, not to talk at all, just, you know, try to quiet the chatter if they were hallucinating. Medication, we did, I think, I think in my time there, I did have two people that were actually catatonic. That was very fascinating to watch that because, so we had individual therapy, we had group therapy, and then basically every interaction on the unit was a therapy per se, just sitting around the coffee table, kitchen table while they were, they could smoke at the kitchen table. It was like, it was a nightmare. It was not, I've never been a smoker. It was horrible. Anyway, so I would, we would try to just watch for that individual's cues and just follow them.

Before the boy left for school, his mom wanted to give him an umbrella just in case it rained. But the boy said that he didn't need an umbrella because it wasn't going to rain and that he would be fine. Then he went outside and it was raining and he had to walk to school.

One day, the girl and her friend were outside playing. And the boy decided to climb the tree to get the cat out of the tree. And then he got stuck and he was too scared to come down. So the girl ended up calling the firefighters. And they rushed over with their ladders to come and get the boy as well as the cat out of the tree. The girl was yelling for him that he would be OK.

And she knows it's going to rain, but he refuses. So he waves bye and off he goes. And of course it starts raining and it rains and it rains. And he gets wet and wet and wet and wet. And he gets wetter. It's pouring and he goes home to mom who is not happy to see him so wet. And he goes back out all dry, but with an umbrella this time. Mother knows best is the premise of this story. So here is a photo, which you recognize. I want you to look at everything that's happening in this picture and tell me the story with a beginning, middle and an end. Okay, well, apparently there was a cat and this cat ran up the tree. And like cats are known to do, the cat wasn't coming down. And it looks like the dog actually possibly chased the dog, the cat up the tree. In the meantime, we have a little girl with her tricycle and she has called her daddy to come help get the cat out of the tree. Daddy took a ladder to the tree. And somehow I'm gonna guess also again, the dog knocked the ladder down. So dad is up the tree. He hasn't got the cat. There's a bird singing, but I don't think the bird has anything to do with this story. Somehow someone called the fire department. So they are on their way with a second ladder and you can see the fire truck parked off in the distance to help retrieve the dad and retrieve the cat.

And he and Rover chased the cat around the yard and the cat ran up into the tree, got to a far branch of the tree and sat down. Well, Annie was really worried about that. She was afraid that Spot the cat was not gonna be able to get down. So she called her dad and asked him to come, please, please help get the cat out of the tree. So her dad used a ladder to climb up onto the first main branch of the tree. And the cat was on one of the smaller branches branching right off of that one, but he couldn't get any farther. And the ladder, he ended up by accident pushing the ladder down. Thank goodness the ladder didn't hit Annie. But meanwhile, Annie's still very, very upset. So somebody, perhaps her mom called the fire department. And so the fire department, the firefighters have brought their truck along with a, what looks like about the same size ladder. And they're going to help either the dad or the cat out of the tree, although perhaps both. My guess is the cat can get out of the tree anytime she wants to. But so my guess is once they help the dad out of the tree, then they will go in the house and get something nice to drink. And the cat will come down on her own and the dog, especially if they get the dog back in the house with them so that he can stop barking at everybody. So I think that's what's going to happen. The dad got down from the tree, they went in the house, the cat casually climbed back down out of the tree and disappeared behind the house.

She was living with her sister. And so I didn't have a brunt of the difficulty. My aunt did. And so what I ended up doing when I came to visit was primarily trying to support my aunt and her supporting of my mom. But what I discovered one time I had to stay with my mom while my aunt was in the hospital. And I was finding it very frustrating and difficult. And so what I discovered is that if I was really frustrated and having a hard time kind of doing what I needed to do, if I would ask her about her childhood, I could get all kinds of fabulous stories. And she remembered lots and was able to tell me stuff that I hadn't heard before, which was wonderful. And later on, after my mom died, my aunt ended up with just age just a very old, she by this time she was 92 or three and was very hard to communicate with because she basically didn't follow what you were saying and couldn't really understand necessarily. And so what we did then I say we because it was me and my cousins, her children, basically just tried to tell her that, you know, listen to her when she wanted to say something she she would tell jokes, which just used to just amaze me that she would tell these crazy she always loved goofy dumb jokes. And so she would continue to tell those. And so we had we enjoyed that and we made sure she knew that and we just tried to reassure her about who she was and where she was and who we were.

I was driving down the street with my kids in my car and my husband, and we were stopped at a traffic light. And I happened to look up into the rearview mirror and saw a van coming at us. And everybody else was stopped, and the van was still coming. So I got scared because I knew we were going to get hit by that van. So I put my foot on the brake to try to keep the car from sliding forward when the guy in the van hit us, which he did hit us. And we did go forward. We had some shaved ice, and when he hit us, the shaved ice flew all over inside the car. And I had stopped the car, put the brake on, so we didn't hit the car in front of us, luckily. But we were very scared. We got out of the car, and the guy took off. And so we just pulled into the next place and called the police and waited for the police to show up. Okay, it looks to me like in this picture, it looks like that there was some bad weather, a lot of rain, maybe some flooding. And it looks like a lady might have been in a car and either got out of her car to try to get out and get out of the water or whatever. And she was floating down the river and got trapped or stopped by a tree branch. And someone on the side may have looked and seen and called the paramedics or 911.

But Cinderella also fell in love with the animals that were there at the house and they befriended her. She looked longingly out of a window to the castle and thought how cool it'd be to one day go there, which those sisters thought were absolutely absurd that she would ever go to the castle. And one day they found out that there was going to be a ball at the castle and so the stepsisters had their dresses made but Cinderella couldn't go because she was a maid, she didn't have a dress. So her fairy godmother decided that Cinderella needed to go to the castle and be happy so she waved her wand, made her a dress. Oh my goodness, it was beautiful. Did her wand and made the pumpkin into a beautiful coach. And she rode into the castle with a beautiful dress and glass slippers and saw the prince and they fell in love almost immediately after they were dancing. But then the clock struck midnight and she had to go because she was about to be changed back into a maid. So as she was running she lost her slipper which the prince actually found and he wanted to find out who this belonged to because that was going to be his wife. So he actually, actually his servant came out and tried all the shoes, first of all on the sisters and of course it didn't fit because they had big fat fucking feet. Sorry, sorry. So then they tried on Cinderella and of course it fit perfectly. And so they reunited with each other and they lived happily ever after. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, I haven't made one of those in a long time. You get out two slices of bread, get the knife out. You have to put the jelly on first because the jelly stick to the knife and then it'll get in the peanut butter. And then you put the peanut butter on and put the two slabs together.

And so she's beautifully dressed. So she goes to the ball, and this prince that was there is so well taken by her beauty that he asks her to dance. And at midnight, she's supposed to leave, or the coach turns back into a pumpkin, and all the drivers turn back into mice, or the coachmen turn back into mice. So she looks up, and it's 12 o'clock, so she runs back out, she gets in the coach, she goes home, and in the process of leaving, she drops her shoe, her slipper, and she's home back in rags again.

I'm thinking when my son was little and he couldn't really communicate. Is that okay? It's in the past? Okay, all right. So he was the second child.

And, but by his, he just, he spoke so much more. He spoke incessantly and it was such garbled speech. Like he spoke, she never spoke, he spoke all the time. She's, when she finally spoke, it was crystal clear articulation and pronunciation. And he just never stopped talking and nobody knew. I knew what he was saying. His sister knew who was for what he was saying, but nobody else could understand. So at his second checkup, I brought it to the pediatricians. Well, he said, boy, let's give him a little bit more time. So I would just, I would, you know, in between that time, I would just stare. I had to stare at his lips and his eyebrows, you know, the expression. It did like, he was so demonstrative in this constant chatter. And myself and my daughter, his sister were the only two who could understand him. My husband would come home from work and he would smile and nod. And he would like give the shifty eye and I'd be like explaining everything that he was saying. So then Bruce would then interact with him. And then his second birthday was in February. That checkup was February. He went back for May. And the pediatrician was like, he's definitely just, I have no idea what he's saying. So meanwhile, the whole time he had fluid in his ears and he had constant ear infections. But this was our first year with this pediatrician. We had moved from Michigan to Massachusetts. So anyway, we get referred to an ENT and to a speech pathologist, speech language pathologist. And we go and we see the ENT. Yes, he has chronic fluid in his ears. So I said, okay.

When he had the therapy at Community Outpatient Services, one of the therapists there made him a communication book in which he could point to a picture and show me what he wanted. And that should have worked, but it didn't. He just didn't really want to use it. So now we have lived together for about two and a half years without hardly any vocal communication from Ted other than what I told you. But I have sort of figured out what Ted wants most of the time. And I can usually ask him, do you want eye drops? Do you want a face wash? Do you want, are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you cold? Do you want a jacket? And he can tell me yes or no. Recently, we have tried something else called, well, it's our Scrabble Tiles. We got Scrabble Tiles and I put them into letter boxes for him to see if that might work, if he could make some words to show me what he wanted. And we have had a very limited success with that, but I would not say it's the magic bullet. Ted can make a simple word if I ask him to, such as cheese, what kind of sandwich do you want? Cheese or bacon? Or what do you want to drink? And he can write, he will sometimes write juice with the letter tiles. Only on two occasions though, has he been able to take the letter tiles and tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out. So, I don't know if we can make that work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it 10,000 times, but mostly it's just, Ted can indicate that he wants something. And then I ask him, do you need the urinal? Or do you want to take a nap? Or are you hungry? Are you telling me I should make supper? And he can tell me, yeah, or no.

To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, first you have to get a loaf of bread, a loaf of sliced bread, and you have to have a knife of some sort and peanut butter and jelly. And so you take out two slices of bread, and you lay them side by side, and you take the knife and you open up the peanut butter, and you scoop out a little bit of the peanut butter with the knife, and you spread it on one of the pieces of bread.

Put that on the other slice of bread, take the same knife that I used for the peanut butter, spread it over the bread, and put the two slices together. A little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree. Her father came along and said, what is it, dear? He says, dad, my cat's in the tree. Well, I can get the cat out. Let me go get my ladder. Father went and got the ladder, climbed up the tree, and then a neighborhood dog came by and noticed the man up in the tree and started barking at the man up the tree and accidentally knocked down the ladder. So the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat, and the fire department had to be called to rescue them both. I guess about seven years ago, I really hurt my back. There's this family that I go and visit that has a little child. And from the time that child was born, this little boy, I always picked him up and swung him around. But as this boy was getting older, as I was getting older, I guess I can't do some of the things that I normally do. This particular time, I picked the boy up and I was swinging him around, picking him up by the arms. And I spread my legs wide open, and I was swinging him backwards and forwards. And I felt something snap in my back. I was in excruciating pain. I almost dropped the kid. I found out later that I had torn something in my back, which required me to be on steroids. But this was pain like I have never felt before, because even just to walk or roll over in the bed, to move a leg, even to move your arms, it's all tied into the back.

And the prince spots her immediately, and he starts dancing with her, and he just has this fabulous time. And the two sisters are just furious that she ended up being there. But she had the one promise there. She had to be out of the house by midnight there. And so she saw the clock starting to chime, the twelve strokes there.

She would call me, or Dad would actually, because she couldn't really dial, but Dad would call, and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming in to the middle of the night and taking her clothes, and she was much thinner than I was, or taking money. Dad would call and, hiding in the garage, and this mother who's maybe 110 pounds at the most, he was kind of frightened of her because she got really mean. But then she got back into a very calm state and slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever. But I learned, and Dad and I went to an Alzheimer's support group, which really, really helped us, especially Dad. Because my mom had done everything. I mean, she had been the one to do all the shopping, send out the cards. And I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards. But finally there was a point when Dad died that she needed full care. And the last six months she couldn't talk or do anything. And she broke her hip, had a fall.

You know, if they think that they're going to die, I think they will, and if they feel they're going to get better, they will.

So I was part of that group for some classes. At the end of the year in the subway station, I met someone who I'm still friends with, who I just adore. But we had been divided into two groups of 50 or 75 people. And she was in the other group, so I never saw her. And in second year, things improved a bit because then I think I made a second friend.

So I slowed down and walked. I was pretty close to our house. I walked into the house. My mother-in-law was there, so my wife was with her because she had Parkinson's, and we were keeping her for six weeks. And so I just went on into the bedroom. I took a shower. I was feeling better. A little weak, but not bad. So I laid down and I was watching at that time the Bulls were in the playoffs, and I'm a big Bulls fan. So I watched that. I went on and went to sleep. And I woke up at four in the morning, and I was sweating profusely. And I could tell that my heart was beating very fast. So my wife took me to the hospital that was very close to our house. And I remember the doctor told me while he was taking the EKG, he says, Mr. Jacobs, you are having a heart attack right now. And that was pretty shocking to me because I was sitting up at the time, and I didn't feel that bad. I knew something was wrong, but it wasn't what I thought a heart attack was. And so he immediately took me and put a balloon in, and probably the best science class I ever had because I was watching the monitors. They were doing this, and they put the balloon in, and the cardiologist said, now watch it as we go up. And it went on up. He said, okay, here's where the blockage is.

But in her haste, one of her slippers that I think was made of glass or something had fallen off and she returned home. Well, the prince who was in hot pursuit was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin drawn by these horses, but did find the slipper and commanded his helpers to search throughout the realm for a young lady that's foot would fit in that slipper.

The next day we had planned to stay all day long and come back on Tuesday sometime and just pot around up there with them, which we had done often before. About nine o'clock in the morning, I got a telephone call from one of my sons here in town. He gave us the news that our eldest son had died in his sleep. Of course, that was a very traumatic and unbelievable thing. So I got this in one room, and I had to walk in the other room and tell my wife. That was very difficult. I've never had a more difficult time, I think, in saying anything except to say that our son Gene died in his sleep. So we threw our clothes in the car, and we took off for Lexington. We got here as rapidly as we could to come back down here to see what was going on. He had found out when he was in his late thirties, early forties, that he was epileptic, and he was taking medicine. Apparently, he had had an epileptic seizure in his sleep, and he died. A few days later, three or four days later, we had the funeral. He's now buried at Calvary Cemetery here. That's where we talked earlier about taking the dog in the car and going to the cemetery. We do that often throughout the week. That happened in 1991, so it's been quite a long time ago. You still think about it, obviously. It's a very traumatic situation to lose a child.

Neither one of us had ever climbed Camelback Mountain, so we didn't realize exactly where to go or where to start. We just picked a spot on the northern side of the mountain, walked in between some of those very expensive homes, and started climbing. Little did we know, we really had gotten ourselves in a lot of trouble doing that. There were times where we were actually hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs just to get from one point to another. About halfway up, we were sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot. And I said to him, I says, man, there's no way we can go back the same way we came. And he says, I know. And I said, I'm serious. He goes, so am I. And so we knew the only way, the only thing, we figured what we'd had to do is make it to the top, and hopefully there would be an easier way we'd come back on the other side. But then we would still have to hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car. To make a long story short, we were all scuffed up. We were tired, scratched up, clothes torn. But we could finally see where we were getting to the top. As we were approaching the top, we saw more people up there. And older people, younger people. And we couldn't believe it that all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time. So when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people, we asked them, how did you get up here? They said, oh, we took this trail down here on the other side. And we couldn't believe that there was a trail. So after that experience, I thank God for helping us through it, because it really made me understand why people had to be rescued from Camelback Mountain. I understand how people can get stuck, why helicopters have to come in and rescue people off of ledges.

A few months before the diagnosis, he'd had triple bypass surgery and had a hard time recovering from it. But he was coming along and getting better, and then he acted funny. He just didn't act right. And I thought maybe he'd had a stroke. So we went to the emergency room, and they did x-rays and this, that, and the other thing, and they also thought he'd had a stroke. So they put him in the hospital and gave him medication, and one of the medications they gave him was prednisone, which is a steroid, and he got better right now. And that worried the doctors, because with a stroke you don't get better with prednisone like that. So they looked further and found a tumor in his brain. And he went down. He lived for almost a year, but he was constantly and perpetually losing ground, and he was in a coma for the last six weeks or so of his life. And I thought the pain I was feeling then was the worst pain I could have, knowing that he was dying. But when he died, the pain was ten times as bad. And if it hadn't been for Hospice of the Bluegrass and their bereavement program, I don't know that I would have made it. When you lose someone like that, you have to do your grief work. You can't go around it, over it, under it. You've got to go through it. And if you don't do your grief work, you're ruined for the rest of your life.

I had the good fortune to work with some young men to develop a basketball team. Very crude work, but we went out to the forest, cut down a couple of trees, dug some holes, put them up as supports, got a local blacksmith to fabricate rims and level some ground and created a basketball court. We were a bush school. Peace Corps organized a high school basketball league and the young men at the school woke me up every morning at 5 o'clock and we went out and practiced from 5.30 to 6.30 or 7 and then for another hour or two after school in the cool of the evening.

Certainly sending emails to find out, taking a moment, saying I want to talk with you. I'm feeling, you know, these are my concerns. How can I better support you? Is there anything going on that you wish to share with me? Those trying to be open, but also respectful of their privacy, and whatever they'd be interested in, asking them. I think it really helps to just start with, these are my concerns, i.e. missing rubric, or behavior in class, or something like that. And then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is, is extremely helpful. Because that gives you a sense of where to go next. With that, I'm trying to think. I've had some really difficult situations with students of, you know, basically just really disagreeing over the approach of the class, or the expectations, and philosophical differences. And I'm trying to think specifically. I mean, involving other people, too, is very helpful sometimes. Because then it's not just you and the other person. If there's an agreement, if an agreement isn't achieved, it helps, from my perspective, to get other people involved, and to find out from also other people who work with this particular individual, is it just this situation, or is it a broader picture problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers, or to get along with their peers.

I mean they had 3-2 beer and 6 percent beer and you were supposed to be 18 to drink 3-2 beer and 21 to drink 6 percent. There was a little place out in the country called Pop Cassidy's where he served us beer when we were just 14 years old, you know. And we went out there and we were playing a pinball machine and we were playing it for a couple of hours and we said, this is boring now, let's do something exciting. So they said, well, okay, let's go out to the old haunted observatory. Now this is the observatory that studied the stars and Cincinnati has a very famous observatory called Adler Observatory, I think. And they just built this as a works project administration project, just some place to get them to do it. So, I mean, immediately after the war they said, we don't need two of these things and this thing is not the stuff, so they abandoned it. And the road, it was just a gravel road. It grew out with weeds and things like that. And it was out in the country and it was out in the moonlight. Kids used to go out there and neck and they used to smoke, not cigarettes. They didn't smoke pot in those days. So we got there first and we parked our car alongside the road and then my buddy and I were walking down the road there and he said, let's hide. The girls are coming after us and when the girls come, we'll jump out and scare them, you know. So I said, you get on that side of the road and I'll get on this other side. So I hid in this big lilac bush. Well, instead of the two girls coming next, there's two more of our buddies coming down the road. And this boy named Dick Smith said, he said, let's hide, jump out and scare the girls. And he got in the same lilac bush that I was in and I tried to coordinate my breathing with him. So he didn't know I was there and he didn't have a clue that I was there. And here comes the two girls down the road. And just as they got there, I grabbed him in the ribs and said, I got you.

I tumbled down the hill about 100 feet, crashing through the darkness, falling off the snowmobile and eventually landing and stopping in the snow. I was momentarily unconscious, and when I woke up, it was dark and cold and silent, which I thought was very bad because I didn't know where I was, and I was in a snowstorm in a mountain in Vail somewhere lost. I began to move around to see if I was injured, and I had hurt my back and my head but could still move around, find my flashlight, and start looking to see where I was. I had actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a 45-degree angle towards the top where the road was, and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was. So I began signaling with my flashlight and trying to yell for people. When I heard a snowmobile coming, I saw the light and flashed my flashlight. He saw me, stopped, and went to get help from the other group of people that we were with. About ten minutes later, they all came back, and after about a half hour, they managed to pull me up and the snowmobile and get us back up to the road to look over my damage and the damage to the snowmobile, which was pretty extensive.

Of course, their feet are too big, won't fit. He finally finds Cinderella and tells her to try it. The sisters say, ah, it wouldn't possibly fit. Cinderella tries it, of course it fits.

It was built in the early 50s, it was a Convair 580, and we were landing in Aspen and the weather was at minimums, which means we were just barely able to land, otherwise if it got any worse we'd have to go back to Denver. But we had a full airplane and we were coming in to land, and the pilots decided to go around because they couldn't see the runway. And when they went to go around, because we're down in this valley, the mountains all around, you have to circle in to this valley in Aspen, and you can't see anything where the mountains are. Well, we were coming in and they decided to go around and they didn't pull the gear up when they went around, so they stalled the airplane. And what that feels like is your whole airplane is shaking and shuddering and going like this, and we could see the tops of the trees, and somehow they put it in a nosedive to get the speed up, and they were barely able to pull it out. And everybody's looking at me, and I'm the flight attendant, I have to smile, and my crew is normally allowed to make two attempts, and they said, that's it, we're done, we're going back to Denver, we're not even, we're done for the day. And I guess the guys that work on the ramp, the ones waiting to flag us in, saw the airplane come in, and they saw what happened, and we almost crashed right over this really fancy area called Starwood where all the celebrities live, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, and Don Johnson, they all had their homes up in Starwood, and Dundon were at the time, but we almost crashed. They said they saw us disappear over the mountain, and their hearts just went to their throats, they were sure we were gone. They were just waiting for the flames to come up. But I was trying to pass out candy afterwards, and beer, and I had this basket of candy, and I was trying to act like I'm really normal, but the candy was popping out of the basket, you know, because my hands were like, it was really strange because it goes really in a slow motion, it's very slow, and you think, okay, this is what it's like to die, how weird, you know, everything gets very drawn out.

When I was 45, I sent to Frankfurt for my birth certificate. Mother and Daddy always told me my birthday was May the 13th, 1938. I sent to Frankfurt for my birth certificate. But my birth certificate had a number of problems. It said my birthday was May the 15th, 1983. It said, to this woman have been born seven other children, all of which are dead. Now the midwife had signed it June the 15th. And she signed it the right year. She signed it 1938, but June the 15th. She either signed it on the day I was born and nobody remembered, or she signed it a month later. So I had to get an attorney to get the year. And they wouldn't change the date. They said, you need to notify your social security and your insurance companies that you had used the wrong birthday. And the only way I had to find an attorney that knew me that would certify that I definitely had not been born in 1983, that it was very obvious that I had been born in 1938. And he referred to the birth certificate date, too. So that's my story. And I don't know that that will ever do anybody any good. But nobody believes me when I tell them.

There's a gentleman in the living room, and when the ball comes in and breaks the window, it also knocks over a lamp, and the man looks out the window to see who broke the window. Probably realizing there's only one child who plays soccer. Okay. I'm going to ask you to do one more story, I'm sorry, one more procedure, and then two more fairy tale type stories. Okay. Okay? So I want you to just tell me how you're going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Pretend I never really made one before. Okay. So to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you need to have some ingredients. The ingredients are bread, peanut butter of your choice, crunchy or shrewd, and jam, jelly, or preserves. I like preserves, so that's what we're going to go with. I also like strawberry. But they come in different flavors, so. So you get your bread out of your bag, and if you have good manners, you put it on a plate. And then use a knife to put peanut butter on one piece of bread, and then if you have good manners, you get a different knife, and you use it to put jelly onto the other side of the bread.

You know, I had one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery, no drugs, no anything. So I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible, terrible pains, and they would be like between my waist and my boobs, and they would last like four hours, and they were bad. I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position, you know, where I could just get some relief, you know, and you kind of felt sick in your stomach, but the pains were terrible. So this happened a few times, and you know, you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find what's wrong. So you tell them all of this, and they think, hmm, in the back of their minds, you just know they maybe have an idea, but they're not telling you a thing. So they send me for a sonogram. Well, I've never had one of those, and so I told them at the place, I said, if you find a baby in there, and I'm like 60 years old, I said, we both can make a lot of money. So it kind of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me. Well, the report comes back later, and so I have a gallbladder problem. So, you know, it's like, what do I do about it? And, you know, nothing happens, a few little simple attacks, but my husband and I are in Tennessee, and the day before we're leaving from Tennessee, I have one of these attacks, scared my husband to death, because he could think what if it had happened the next day, and we were on an airplane.

And in the furnaces in a large plant, it's always a concern. An industrial plant is something to be very cautious, not to be fearful of, but to be cautious about your people who are working for you, and also about your own behavior. You don't want stupid things. And I worked midnights, which I was the only female in the plant. And that still was not a fearful situation, but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was. And the machinery was working, and we never had an accident, we never had a fire, we never had a widow blizzard. But they would have never left me alone. I mean, they picked me up at the plant and took me back home. But that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in. But it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job.

Well, first, you need bread, at least two slices. You need peanut butter, at least a tablespoon or two, and a tablespoon or two of jelly. You need a knife and a surface to make it on. You take the two pieces of bread, and you put them down. And with your knife, you spread peanut butter on one side, coating the inner of one side of bread.

So she ran out, but as she ran she lost one of the slippers, one of the glass slippers, which the prince recovered and then he went searching throughout his kingdom to try and find the girl or the woman who matched the slipper and he came to the house where Cinderella was with her stepsisters and the stepsisters, their feet were too big and would not fit into the shoe and Cinderella was allowed to try the shoe and it fit and she went off to marry the prince and live happily ever after."}, {"filename": "capilouto25a_99711_228549.wav", "transcript": "About 14 years ago, when I had my normal mammogram that year, my doctor found that I had a spot, possibly a lump, in my breast, my left breast.

The next day, they operated on my leg. They were able to splice the tendon, sew it together.

I know one day there's a party, the prince is having a party and he invites everybody but they don't tell Cinderella about this party and the evil stepsisters go because they want to marry him. And then her fairy godmother pops up and says, you can go to this party, all you have to do is be back by midnight. So she gives her a pumpkin that she turns into a coach and she turns the mice into horses, I think. And so they all go, the prince falls in love with her at the party, but she has to leave by midnight because then she turns back into her normal self and it turns into a pumpkin. As she's running away, she loses her glass slipper on one of the steps. So she goes home, okay, and he doesn't know who she is and then he puts a decree out, he wants to find all the girls in the area who fit this glass slipper. So he goes house to house and he's, I think the two other sisters try on the glass slipper, it doesn't fit, but then she comes out and they try it on and then she turns into the princess again and they get married and live happily ever after.

Then you go to the refrigerator, choose, take out the loaf of bread, take out the butter, or oleo, whatever it may be. Take the bread and oleo over there. Then you go to the cupboard, get the peanut butter. And maybe you want jelly, so you bring jelly along also. But you didn't ask for jelly. So anyway, you then, you then take the piece of bread out of the bag, put it on a plate, or on a paper towel. I use a paper towel. You then open the butter. I use, it's like butter, it's a bucket kind of thing. Open it up, take the knife, scoop some butter out, put it on the bread. However, if you're very conscious of your cholesterol and so forth, you don't use butter. But I don't care. You put it on the bread, then you take some peanut butter, you take the lid off the peanut butter jar. You then put peanut butter on the bread, fold it in half and eat it. When you're done, you then put the lid back on the peanut butter, you put the lid back on the butter, put the peanut butter away, you put the butter away in the refrigerator, put the bread away in the refrigerator.

But one of the issues I've always had with swim team is that I would love going to the practice and talking with the people on the teams, but whenever we would compete was when I would get super nervous. I would be very on edge, and there were times where someone had asked me, I need you to do this race for me, or I can't do this race, and they'd ask me to step in. And the idea of going into a situation and saying, okay, I only have to do these few races was something that kept me calm during those. So when someone would come up and say, hey, I need you to do this race, or I need you to do this, it would throw off my balance, and I'd be like, I can't even swim anymore, or something like that. But there were some times where it worked out, and sometimes it didn't, but overall, I was still there, and I still wanted to help the team. So when this regional race came up, it was the first time I had gone to it, because I missed it my freshman year, because I had to go to some family thing. So it was the first time I was there. And what had happened last year was we got last place out of everyone. So I was kind of glad I wasn't there. But this year, our instructor, or our coach, was telling us that he had high hopes for us because we had won a majority of our other competitions, or other meets. So he put everyone on their usual races, and then for me and some other kids, he gave us some extra races, which was something I'd never dealt with before.

But if you were to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. First thing I would do is get a plate and a knife, and then I would go get some peanut butter and two slices of bread and a jar of jelly. The first thing I would do is I would take peanut butter and I would spread it on one of the pieces of bread, just on one side of one piece of bread. Then I would get the jelly, and I would spread it on one side of the other piece of bread. And when I had them both completed, I'd put them together, and that's the peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

So tell me all of the steps on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. OK, well, since you don't know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I will tell you. So first, you get two pieces of bread. Doesn't matter what kind of bread, just any bread. And then you get peanut butter, and you get jelly. And I guess there's lots of ways to do it, but the simplest way is just get a knife, get some peanut butter on there, and then spread it over one piece. And then take the knife, and then dip in the jelly, spread it over the other piece. It's going to be harder with the peanut butter, because the peanut butter's real sticky, and if your bread's really soft, it's going to tear. So be really careful. And the thing about jelly is that it's really clumpy, so it might take a while to smooth out everywhere. And so then you just put the two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and jelly stick to each other, and then you eat it. And that's how you make peanut butter and jelly."}, {"filename": "capilouto55a_1038140_1160300.wav", "transcript": "And I used a lot of poisonous stuff setting up my specimen, but I survived.

The grandmother does say with the condition you can have this but only until midnight. You have to get home by midnight otherwise all the stuff will go back to what it was originally. So Cinderella ends up going to the ball the prince sees her and it's like wow who's that beautiful girl I've never seen her I'm bummed with all these other ladies that are at this ball she's great so they end up dancing all night. So Cinderella realizes just before midnight that she has to get out otherwise the prince will realize that she's of a can't be like shouldn't be there and so she runs down the steps but one of her shoes falls off which she doesn't care because she just has to get out of there because she's got her reputation tainted and she gets home.

And there were phrases that the computer would turn, like write, or there was code for write. The student coming in, or the college graduate now, they would code it in just common language, COBOL.

And so typically, conversations with her aren't exactly conversations. They are redirections, I would say. I try to prompt her to speak about something she does remember, and when she goes off, we just let her follow her thoughts wherever they go. And if she gets into a kind of sad place, then I try to redirect by pointing something out that distracts her, like, is that a bird out the window? And she'll begin someplace else.

And so you spread that on there. You don't want too much. Um, say a centimeter of peanut butter. Maybe that's a little too thick, but that's the idea. You want like a decent amount of peanut butter. And then you scrape the knife to get the peanut butter off of it because you don't want to wash it off in the sink and get out another knife. It sounds like a lot of effort. Let's be frank. And then you put the lid back on the peanut butter, put it back in the cabinet. You pull the jelly toward yourself. You unscrew that. You set the lid down. It's new. You feel less bad about ruining it. Because even though it's an equally perfect surface, it's kind of darker. And so it's not as pretty as the golden loveliness of the peanut butter. And so then what I like to do is I like to stop it also and stir it up a little bit because it's easier to spread if you're not just like getting out a gloop of it. So you stir it up some, get into a nice, you know, a little liquidy consistency, but it's still, you know, jelly. And then you angle it over your second slice of bread and then you take the knife to scrape some out. You can try to just scoop some out on top of the knife, but it'll fall off. It's just scrape some out of the loose stuff and then spread that thinly on top. Not too thinly, a little less than you did for the peanut butter, but not much. And then you take these pieces and you take the peanut butter piece and you put it on top of the jelly piece because you don't want the jelly to fall off if you put it on top of the peanut butter piece.

The ladder fell, but the little girl doesn't care about her dad being stuck. She just is concerned about the cat. And the dog is really excited because so much is happening. So he's barking.

Sometimes it's nice to toast it first. On the other hand, it's not necessary. It's whatever you feel like at the time. Well, having prepared the bread, the next thing we do is to start spreading. My way of making the best peanut butter and sandwich there is, is to spread the peanut butter first. Others do it differently, but this is how I recommend it. It works better. This way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread. After that, a little bit of butter, not too much, but some, tends to help make the thing a little bit more moist than usual. On top of that goes the jelly. Having done so, what a lot of people fail to have ever learned is, regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have, peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth. Well, there's an easy way around that. Most people don't know my special secret. My special secret is lettuce, nice leaves of iceberg lettuce, just a couple, is just right to do it, and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you've ever had.

I was about eight months pregnant then, and became very, very ill with pyelonephritis and actually went into premature labor and was quite concerned that the baby would be born. At that time, they didn't have the large premature baby centers and that sort of thing, so I knew as a nurse that the baby would be in jeopardy if it had to be born at that time. I was in the hospital three days getting IV fluids and laying flat on my back and could hardly raise my head. I was so sick. But I did recover, and I was working at that time, but I did not go back to work after that episode because then, about a month later, the baby was born on time.

So, this guy comes along, and he has a ladder, and he thinks that he is going to help this little girl get the cat out of the tree. And then, while he's up there, he accidentally kicks the ladder over, so now he's stuck, and the cat is still stuck. The little girl obviously does not care that the man is also stuck in the tree, so now he's not very concerned with the cat anymore, because now he's stuck in the tree. And honestly, this kind of seems a little silly, because that guy should be able to jump from that tree. Now, this dog, it seems as though it's violent, but I think that it's probably after the cat, rather than the man. So, I think he should probably just be able to yell at the dog and jump down and get rid of it. This dog does not look very violent. Now, I don't know who has called the fire department. I'm assuming that this guy has not. And, judging from this picture, this is before anyone had cell phones.

It was such an immense change culturally. And also we lived in a very rural area in New Mexico up in the mountains. We lived in Taos, which is the biggest town that we lived in, which is not a very big town at all. So when we came here, it was absolutely shocking. I mean, just the fact that they had sidewalks all over the place, it just amazed us. And the street lamps and everything. I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the West and the urban areas in the East is the East is so much more muddy. It's so much richer. And they can afford to do all that. We had a lot of unpaved roads out there. Of course, there's a lot sparser population, so a lot of times they're not going to pave these huge long roads all over the place. But here, it was just amazing to us. All the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city. It was just indescribable, the impact that it had on us.

So, since it was so far along, they said that the only thing that was left to do was to have a total hip replacement.

So he went off on a normal day and I remember playing with my friends in the beautiful summertime, just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries, to finding out that he was in the hospital. And a friend of mine and I put some cookies together for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with death. So it's kind of a sad story, but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the cycle of birth and death and whatnot. So it turned out that he passed away that night and I never did see him again. And I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship.

And not only that, obviously the father had brought a ladder but it's still on the ground and it's not doing any good. And there must have been a call to the fire department because here comes two firemen with a big ladder and they're trying to come over and see what they can do about this cat.

He told her that since his house was only a good 30 feet away, he could run and go up a ladder to go up into the tree to get the cat down. And asked that she could look after his dog while he went and did so. So she held on to the dog while she watched the cat and went back down a ladder, climbed up the tree, and very soon after which the ladder fell down, stranding him and the cat in the tree. Now, he tells Elisa to go phone the fire department to get them both down from the tree.

Part of the story, she's told that she has to leave by midnight and as they're having a good time, she realizes that the clock starts to chime and she realizes that she has to leave because everything is going to be changed back to the way her life is. And so as she is leaving from the ball, she leaves a slipper, a glass slipper, depends on which store you listen to, that is left at the ball. And so she leaves and the prince doesn't know who this girl is and all he has is this shoe. So now comes a point of trying to find out who this girl was and hopefully by checking the shoe if it fits, they had an edict from the king that all the women are to be checked to see who this shoe will match. So as Cinderella and her stepsisters are hoping that they'll be able to see the, check the slipper, the stepmother doesn't want Cinderella to have that chance. So the stepsisters try to hear, fit the slipper and it doesn't. And as things change, Cinderella gets a chance to have the slipper to see if it will fit.

Apparently they like her a lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her thing.

She was looking out the window kind of dreaming about it, but she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball. So Belle went to the ball and while they, I don't remember exactly how it was that she ended up, I guess the fairy godmother came while she was at, was while they were at the ball and the fairy godmother told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that she would take her to the ball in. It was a pumpkin carriage and take her to the ball. And I remember this one picture there that seems a little weird. The horses were sitting on their hind legs with their feet up, something like, you know, they were standing there on four legs. It was kind of weird. And so the fairy godmother took her to the ball and she got to the ball and went in and nobody knew who it was because she was so beautiful. Nobody knew who she was. And they had the ball and the prince liked her. And then the times went off in the clock, in the big clock, big band or whatever. And Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before, back home before midnight. And it was after midnight.

I went to bed on a Monday night after work, and just like any other night, I expected I was going to sleep and get up and go to work the next day. About one or two in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom, and I was struggling to get the covers off. I was laying on my left side, so I was trying to get the covers off with the right, and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were. That was my first sign something was wrong. At first, I thought, because I had the two cats, and I thought they were laying on the covers or something, but the room was dark, and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might. Finally, they came off, and then I tried to take some steps. The bathroom was the next room over, and I was finding that I was exhausted, and I decided I would just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed. I don't know why I didn't think to just get back in the bed, but I just laid on the floor. I laid there for about 30 minutes. My garment told me what was going on with the timeline, and so when I got back up, I still didn't feel like I could make it to the bathroom, so I didn't just crawl back in the bed. Then about, I was awake asleep back and forth till about eight o'clock, and I was trying to figure out something's wrong with me, but I don't know if this is major, and I was trying to decide it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart, and I didn't want to go to the emergency room, and there'd be nothing wrong, but I called a guy from work. I used my phone, and I thought I was dialing his work number, but I got his cell phone number, so I wanted to leave him a voicemail message, and I was surprised to hear him answer, and that's when he told me you called my cell number, so I worked for a very difficult company to work for, and I didn't want to go to the emergency room, tell them yet what was going on, so I kind of jokingly told him something that would make him laugh, but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day, and I said pass the word on. My brain's not working right today. I won't be in, and so he just chuckled and said, well, okay, I'll pass that on, and then I called a friend and told him what was going on, and then between two of us, we decided, well, my idea, I will call him a half hour. If you don't hear from me, call me. If you can't reach me, call for help, so a half hour later, I called him, and I decided I'm going to call my neighbor, take me to the hospital, so I did with my neighbor when my neighbor next door came and got me, and we went to the hospital. I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did. It was a great one. We got four hospitals to choose from, so I don't even know why or remember why we went to that one, but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago."}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-1_485541_725029.wav", "transcript": "but it's mainly working with seeing the words and then saying it out loud. That's been more, I think, than anything else. And I worked hard at it for a long time and then I got kind of, afterwards, I've kind of gotten a little slow about it, or not slow, but just haven't done it as as diligently as I used to. But for the first months after the stroke, I worked hard at it, trying to pull those pictures back. And I found that it's like learning in school again, grade school, you look at a word, you learn that word and, oh, that's that word and it comes back and it stays back. With aphasia, it doesn't stay there. It's more like having an electronic dictionary that occasionally gets scrambled. You know, it's like, okay, I know that word is not in the dictionary where it should be, it's over there instead, you know, that type of thing. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something that important that has happened to you in your life? Could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently? Happy? I think when my grandson was born, he was a joy to be with. And I got to spend a lot of time with him when he was little as an infant and watching him grow. And just, that was special. He's 10 now and he doesn't spend as much time as his grandpa as I liked then. And he's off doing other things. Here are some more pictures that also tell a story. Take a second to look at them. And then whenever you are ready, tell me the story that you see with a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay, now, first of all, these pictures are under the last four stories. So I can't see what's there. There are two ways to fix that. We can click and drag the, all the windows or you can minimize it. All right, got it. All right, let's do this. Such a, there we go. Down below it now. Okay, boy's out kicking a soccer ball. He kicked it, got a little too close and kicked it through the window. I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad. But the window came through the yard and the, I'd say his dad saw it open, looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball. Here's some more pictures. They also tell a story. So take a second to look at all of them. And whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see. It's a beginning, a middle and an end. Okay. In the beginning, mom sent little boy out to go to school. She had, he had a backpack."}, {"filename": "NEURAL42-2_941020_1180440.wav", "transcript": "Yeah, looks like for some reason they gave, it seems like another cousin with them, they gave her with their aunt and two of her cousins, they sent over to her. So I'm not sure why they sent him that way. But anyway, whoever gave it and said, that'd be nice, we'll give it to you and stuff like that, they'll keep it, it'll make it good for you too. But then the aunt was very nice. She made her pretty bad. She had to go work outside and everything else and get, she's sorting the dirt and all that stuff. But her cousins were very nice. They got to do whatever they wanted and they're kind of, but, so that's how it was for all the time. She tried to be nice, but they were still not very nice. But the one time they were gonna have, I guess they do for the sometime of the year, they get to see everybody. So they went to see if this would be, see their aunt took the two girls and make sure they're gonna find their, one of the boy, the great boy is one of those that comes there. So they're gonna go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that. But their cousin didn't know she was supposed to be there, but a, what do you say it would be? Not a ghost or something, I don't know, but they had one that would bring on the way. That's not normal how the people in Silicon, it was totally different how they flew in here. But they got to hold her and got her some different clothes in Silicon so she could go in that way. So she got to go in that place and went to see there that night, got up. She'd go sing and play or was out there, got some people and that's where they saw the big, it's one of the, I think he's, I don't know if he is the king or he might be just the new king coming there. He was out there, he was with her for a while, but then she had to leave and he was worried what happened to her, but she left and he was worried about that, that she did drop one of her shoes. So he had that, so they went back. She was going back her place where she was just not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff. But her cousins, of course, tried to told that it was her shoes and they put them on there and her feet are huge. So it wasn't gonna work on that. But then while they're there, he did bring them over to her and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes. So he knew what it was. So he took her back and that's one of the great, the best thing you could ever do. She went back, she's like queen now. So best thing that came on that way.

The guy is sitting there probably watching TV or something but he gets up, picks up the soccer ball, walks over to the window and you know, the window, I think we talked about this last time, the window is there, the lamp where the soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore, the lamp is gone, the curtains are a little bit different but there's, I'm not sure what, I'm not sure what the, I'm not sure what some of the, something is there, anyway, the guy looks to the, looks out the window as though he's looking to see where it came from but the lamp and the chair are no longer there and I think the, I'm gonna say that the window ledge is lower than it was, it just, it looks different.

We'll take you and put you in the hospital, take four or five days. I have to cut into your skull and go in there and go in there and we'll take that, fix that, we'll actually seal it off and then you'll be as good as new. Everything will be okay.

I continue practicing driving and so forth. And I went back to the hospital and made an appointment to go in surgery on May the 1st. I'm sorry, May the 6th. That had all happened on April Fool's Day, on April 1st of 2015. And so, I went in for the surgery on May the 6th of that year, 2015. And little did I know I wasn't gonna come home for quite a while. I wouldn't be home for another six months. And in the meantime, excuse the French, the shit hit the fan and it did, big time. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you, okay. So, that was my second stroke. Well, okay, so what happened was, when I went into the hospital then to have that surgery, and again, it's on tip of my tongue that I wanna say what it is. Maybe I'll think of it later. So, when I went to have that taken care of while I was in the hospital then, they did the surgery and the surgery was a success. The problem was that when I went back, when I was in recovery from that surgery, I was in recovery and, ignore that, you can. Sorry, make sure it's not, no, it's okay.

I'm calling her a heart doctor. And she talked me instead to go to the emergency room. Went to the emergency room and they discovered that I'd had a stroke. And so they put me in the hospital. And I was there three days. They were trying to, basically my heart was out of rhythm and beating too fast and lots of different things. So they spent three days basically just dealing with that heart issue, getting it stabilized. And then three more days, basically discovering that I'd had a stroke and aphasia. And then I was, went home after the, trying to think what day of the week it was. Wednesday, Wednesday I went home. And Thursday I drove back to the, drove then, because I could drive. I could do everything I needed to do except talk. So I went to make an appointment with the speech therapy at that point. And that's where it started. Do you mind telling me a little bit about that, like your recovery? So what kinds of things have you done to help you get better since your stroke? Well, it started out with something simple because basically I can look at anything, know what it was, but I couldn't pull the words out. And so we started with a simple thing, like in the room, for example, looking around the room, looking at each object in the room, naming it, trying to find the word and say the word out loud. So that's where it first started and it built from there. And some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago, like with the pictures, look at the picture, name the picture. And over time that gradually got better and better, but that's where I think the start with the therapy was. And then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out. And I found when writing, taking a paper and pencil and writing, I couldn't spell properly anymore. And so that was something I had to work at. So I found that with my keyboard, I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil and with a notebook here, the same thing. It has a spell checker and a spell, I'm not sure what you'd call it, necessarily a checker, but it starts out, if you start the first few characters of a word, it gives you several different words that work.

Went back to have breakfast and as I was reading the newspaper, while I had breakfast, I tried to read, but I could not make it, read the paper properly.

So I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again and I couldn't make it. So I finally said, I can't do it, I need to go home. So I went home, went to bed.

So I knew what was going on, I knew I was having a stroke. Against my, well, I probably, I shouldn't have done it, but I called Sharon and I said, you probably need to come home. I'm gonna head, I'm gonna go to the hospital. I don't feel right, I'm not sure what's going on, but you better just come on home. And I said, I'm gonna head to the hospital. Just come on down to the emergency room when you get here. So I did, I went out and I got in my truck and I went to the hospital, which isn't very far away. It's about six or eight blocks away from here. And I drove to the hospital and drove into the emergency room parking and walked into the hospital and I said, I think I'm having a stroke. And they didn't waste any time. Said, okay, somebody, come on, come back. We're gonna take you and have somebody look at you right away, which they did. They took me, put me in one of the examination rooms and they started to examine me. Sharon, she was about a half hour away. So she got there after this had started, that the questions, I think that it had already taken me to get a CT scan or whatever it was before she got there. So when she got there, I was already had gone in to get a scan. And so when they had, when I was done with that, they took me back into the waiting, back into the room where I was, the treatment room, whatever you call it, in the emergency room. And I remember pretty well that, you know, Sharon was there and I remembered, I knew what was going on, that I had a stroke, but I felt like it was probably, it wasn't getting any worse. It was just stroke. So I wasn't too worried about it."}, {"filename": "adler07a_526167_765101.wav", "transcript": "I was never hospitalized with this thing, other than the emergency room. And about a week later, my doctors sent a neurologist to me. And when he got done talking with me and everything, and he looked at me, he says, you had a stroke. He says, it wasn't a big one, but he says, you had a stroke. So that's how I knew I had a stroke. It was really, really weird. But I forgot so many things. Like in the morning, every morning, after I got my breakfast ready, I always brought the newspaper out, and I read the newspaper. And I couldn't read it. I looked at it, and I couldn't get the words. I knew what they were, but I could not say any of those words. And what I did get to read, I didn't understand. So I tried for a couple of days, and I thought, what the heck with this, I just won't read anymore. After a couple more days, I'm sitting there, and I thought, you are going to learn to read that paper. I started reading it. Now I read a paper. And it didn't take me long, but I worked hard on it. And every morning, when I got up, after I went to the bathroom and everything, I'd go back in bed, and I'd lay there. And I'd think of my daughter's family. There's four people in the family. There's two boys, her husband and herself. I knew her name, but I couldn't get his name out, and the two boys. And I would just close my eyes and visualize it, and gradually, all of a sudden, I'd see their names. And gradually, it would come. Then I went with my oldest son, with his family. It was tiring, and I did that at night, too, when I went to bed, before I went to sleep. I worked with one family at a time, and then my sisters and my brother and all that. And it was a long time, but it worked. It really, really worked. And I said to my daughter one day, I says, you know, I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me. I says, I am so tired. And I says, I don't do anything. She says, Mom, you are doing a whole lot. I says, such as what? She says, all I'm doing is thinking about this one, and thinking about, well, that's it. You are thinking constantly, and you're exhausting yourself, and you don't realize it. But it all came. It's just now I have trouble every once in a while to get my words out. And that, and when I write, it's getting better. Sometimes when I write, I write the words and everything, and all of a sudden, I look at it, and I thought, no, that's not that word. And the first time I saw that was when I made my first, when I was going to the store, my little shopping thing. I needed mayonnaise, so I'm writing and writing. I get to the store, and I came to that word. I couldn't figure out what it was. It wasn't even making any kind of sense, and I couldn't remember what it was. And by the time I got done shopping, I would keep going back at it, and back. Now, I had to think, what was I going to do with this? Then I knew what it was. It would come. I'd forget it again, but then it, but that's the way it goes.

He's like, this is the last thing I want to run my daughter. I got enough trouble with her. Well anyway, they eventually got married. And then, but she was determined she didn't want any kids. She was just sure she would screw him up. And it's just too hard. And so me and my husband will just, you know, we'll just see the world. And they did. They did a lot of traveling and everything. And I had just, and I have a son too, but he didn't seem to have any interest in getting married or having kids or anything. And so I just thought, you know, I may never have any grandbabies. I sure would love them, but if not, then okay. So I just worked in the church nursery and kind of helped get my baby fix there. And then my son and daughter moved to Florida. And by this time, you know, I realized through some different experiences that he loved her and was very protective of her. And I was always super protective of my kids. And I realized he was just as protective of her, if not more so, than I ever was. And so I thought, he's gonna cart her off to Florida and I don't want her to be so far, but at least I won't worry about her. Because he would die for her. And so then I don't remember how long they've been there, maybe a year or so. And she, she came back to town and a relative on his side had a baby. And she wanted to hold that baby. And I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby. And she just, I remember I took a picture of her with that baby. And I thought she just looks so natural with that baby, like she's held them all her life. And she told me, I really want one now. And so it took maybe another year or two, because she was losing babies, she lost two or three. And then when she had this one, and maybe about six months in, I'm in Indiana, and she's in Florida, and I'm nesting. And then my house is reasonably clean anyway. But, but I cleaned my whole living room once and I just said, you know, it had been recently remodeled. And so there wasn't a lot of junk in there.

They didn't look like they were, the little girl was, two little girls, they looked like they were dangerous people. And the cat looked like it was somebody that, the cat was like a funny-looking cat, too. On this side, it was like a little girl, and she was very nice-looking.

And they were, and he was, he was probably in the, in the, what do you call that place again? I said it right, but now I've forgotten what to call it. The castle. They were going to have a, like a dance there, with music. And they had this glass shoe that if they found the right one that would fit, that would be his, that would be his wife. So a lot of people came to the, to the castle, and they had the dance, they were dancing. And, and I think this, this young woman was very good looking. She was like, she had to work there, maybe it was her, maybe it was the mother or something. But she had, her two daughters, older daughters weren't very attractive. And they were probably hoping that they were going to be ones that would, somebody, this handsome man was going to marry her.

It was like they were full of bricks or something and so I got them off when I just really focused on it and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the next room over was too far for me to walk.

But the speech therapy, I found some therapists I just connected with better than others. And the one I spent the most time with, I really liked her a lot. She was very good and very positive. And as she explained something important to me, she said in the beginning, she said, I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now. Then after we work together a while, I'll test you again to gauge where you're at. The therapist I had worked with before that never explained that to me. So when they would ask me these questions and quiz me, I was frustrated. I felt so stupid because I couldn't do them. But if I had known earlier that that's what they were doing, it would have made it so much better. But they didn't think to tell me that. But I did games on my phone. I went to a local college that had meetings on Thursday evenings for two hours. And so the first hour, everybody's in the same room. And then the second hour, we're split up into groups. And the leader is the one who decides what group we go into. So you go into a group with about four or five other people who are about your same level. I bought books, grade school books for math and reading and tracing letters and numbers. And I did that on my own, and I did puzzle books. And then I went back to work. I went back to work very quickly, way before I really was able to do much. But I just thought I've just got to get in there and do it. So I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke. It was something else. I always liked to cook, but now I've really kicked it up. I found out about healthy eating, and I've always liked junk food. And I decided to eat really healthy. I felt like that would help me recover. And so I got these cookbooks. And learning to understand measurements again was difficult at first. But I learned, and I still struggle with it sometimes."}, {"filename": "MSU02b_442018_680276.wav", "transcript": "And he goes back for the umbrella. Here's another picture.

Do you remember much about it? I think so. These pictures might remind you of how it goes.

Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details about the story as well as the pictures you just looked at. Well, there was a girl named Cinderella and her father was getting remarried. And when he got remarried, he had two stepsisters, two stepdaughters, and the stepmother didn't like Cinderella and they made her do all of the housework and cooking of the food and whatever. And finally a ball came around and all the stepdaughters were going to the ball and Cinderella couldn't go because she had too much to do. And fairy godmother came to her and said, you could go to the ball and she made a beautiful dress for her and she made a coach with a pumpkin, I think, and then they take her to the ball and she had beautiful time."}, {"filename": "BU11a_303929_542040.wav", "transcript": "And I, yeah, and only, you know, my two cousins and my friend Mary Kelly could come in and join in and visit me.

And they said, I didn't have any sensation on the right side and I didn't have any vision on the right side either. And they said, you have to go to a hospital to recuperate and that is when I went to Spaulding and stayed there for nine weeks, recovering little by little. And I was walking with the help of Lauren, my physical therapist. And Kate was a godsend. She was working with me for my speech. That is all I care about, will my speech come back. And so then when in April, it was time for me to move on. And so I went to a step down facility called the Sherrill House in Jamaica Plain. And that is all of my therapist, Sherry, Sean, and Andrea, they took very good care of me. And I had OT with Sean and PT with Sherry and speech every day with them and it was good. And then I went home in August 1st and they fixed the house so that I could have a bedroom on the first floor. And we, oh, then I had the visiting nurses come in and for August, no, just, no. September, October and November, the first two weeks of November, I had physical therapy and speech and OT at my house. And then I went to see facilities that could do outpatient treatment.

And they locked Cinderella not to go. And so she was upset, Cinderella.

And so the dad was a good man, but like a lot of people, I guess, would eventually think that maybe he might want to try to meet someone else. And so that ends up happening, and really messed up by marrying this other woman who ends up, she's just so cruel and so selfish, and okay, what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life. And so what I mean now is that the, what is it called? The other woman, she now has the power, I guess, where she's really being awful with Cinderella, and I guess maybe even the, her dad might have died, I don't remember about that. Anyway, so they're showing, they would show in the story then now how Cinderella, her life has just totally changed. She went through a really nice life, which was deserving of her, because she was a very, very wonderful person, very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone.

But I was afraid to look for another job, because if the next job doesn't work out, because I left this job on my own, I wouldn't get much unemployment. So I was really afraid to move and there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work. So I felt really trapped. But I was looking, but it was just, there really wasn't a lot to pick from. And well, anyway, the day, three months or so before they laid me off, I just had a feeling it was going to happen. So I started collecting my information that I was going to need later. And I put my notes in a notebook, and I took them out to my car. And then when I wanted to refer to them, I went out to my car and looked at them, I didn't keep them at my desk. I took everything out of my office except for things that belonged to the company. I saved off programs I had written, everything. So then when the boss and the HR guy came to my office and told me, I was real happy about it. I tried not to look so happy about it, but I was really happy. And then I was out of work for 10 months. And it was okay, because I had unemployment, I had money savings, and I was doing all right with that. The great thing is also that I got a wonderful job.

What am I making for supper? He says, what you were, we were making lamb chops on the grill and I had them marinated. And I says, well, what was I making?

So after they were gone, the fairy godmother showed up and showed them how she could do it and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and then Cinderella was given a fine dress to wear and then when she got to the palace when she got to the ball, the only thing when she got to the ball, the prince could see nothing but Cinderella and they danced the night away and then at 12 o'clock she said she had to go and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground.

And so while I was in the hospital, she provided a lot of papers for me to think of words and some simple math to do, but mostly words. And I tried to get that stuff done. Before I saw her next. And it was like really important. I was just super motivated. And then when I was released, it was gonna be a month or so before therapy would start up. And so I contacted her again.

Let me start here. And so I did that. And I got puzzle books for kids to do. And so I did those. And I always did like to cook before, but now I have a specialization and a special interest in cooking healthy food. And I wanted it to be food that tasted good. And so I got some healthy recipes and worked on those. And I was surprised to see that I struggled with conversions, like a jar of garlic. Half a teaspoon is one clove. And when the recipe called for two cloves, I struggled with that. I was like, and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon. So I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work.

And interestingly, in July, so that was May, in July, middle of July somewhere, I had another stroke. And I was at that point, I was in a rehabilitation center, a rehab hospital, and they took me my ambulance because I felt, I could feel that something was going on and I was afraid of a stroke, but I couldn't say it was a stroke, but I knew there was something going on and Sharon could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem. They took me to the hospital and did scans and so forth. And sure enough, I had another stroke.

So I can only see out of one eye at a time. So I was wearing an eye patch over one side, then I'd wear it for a while over the side, but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see with both eyes. I could see with both eyes, but I'd see different things. And so when I had the second stroke or when I was third stroke in the hospital, the vision started to clear up. And I remember telling Sharon, I said, my vision is getting better. I can see better. I can focus. I can focus with my eyes. And it turned out I could. And then I also told her that I thought I could start to move my leg a little bit. And, you know, because when you're paralyzed, you're not sure whether it's moving or not. You think you're moving it, but it really isn't. And I said, you know, look at my leg and see if it's moving. And because I really felt like it was. And indeed it was moving. It was moving.

She is a true extrovert. In fact, you look up in Webster extrovert and says, see Sandy Martin. But anyway, so she and her girlfriend, her wingman walked up to me and said, oh, he is the dance here. And well, I answered, I was supposed to be, that's why I'm here. And I just, I hung around her that dance. And that's where we started dating. And we dated for probably three years or so, dated around about three years or so. And after about four years, I figured out that, well, maybe something's going on here and I ought to get more serious about this. So it was just, I accused her of picking me up at a school dance. That's where we first met, and she picked me up at a dance. That's where we first met, and she picked me up at a dance. All right, here are some more pictures. Take a second to look at them.

All right, whenever you're ready. A young boy, looked like a grade schooler had his soccer balls kicking it. He ends up going through a house window. A gentleman on a couch, there in the window, sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him, and then he gets the balls, stands by the broken window, trying to find out just what went on."}, {"filename": "NEURAL57-1_1708085_1945177.wav", "transcript": "Okay.

So, like, uh, a party, you know, but you dance and look beautiful. And, um, everyone could go, and I think they're going to do that because they want the, um, prince, I think he's a prince, and he finds, he needs to find a lady. And so there's a way to do it, I think. So, um, they said let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him. And, um, so when they got their paper, um, I think she even gets to go. She didn't say she couldn't go, but she had a beautiful dress in her, um, I say it's not a box, it's something pretty, but I don't know what they call those things. And, um, but she was looking at the dress and, oh, I'm going to look so good.

And then she, she looked at the clock, which I, now I forget to tell you, but you know, she's only allowed, she's only, she is only allowed to be there until midnight. And so she just kept looking at the clock. She's good at that, she's watching. And so as they were dancing and everything, she thought, ooh, I gotta go. And so of course he probably said, can we just stay longer? And she said, no, I gotta go. So she's running. And I'm sure even the, one of the guys who worked there even had a question. And she, I think she said, I gotta go. And so as she went, one of her shoes fall down and she gets all the way home. And of course you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for, you know, back.

But Cinderella is really a very attractive girl. And she longs to be in their position. She longs to be in the top ranking in the aristocratic... She longs to be an aristocratess. And so, what she does is she worships these two girls. And they treat her really quite badly. And so, Cinderella has a dream about... Or a longing, at least, to have their lifestyle. And she has a dream where she is... Let's start with a dream. In reality, she pretends to be one of the daughters. And she is found out because the shoes that her daughters wear do not fit. They're much too big for Cinderella. They do not fit on her feet. And so, when she goes... She's now dressed pretending to be one of the girls. And she is found out because the shoes do not fit.

And this was a Friday morning that I'd gone to work on Thursday, couldn't work. So on Friday, when I got up, I went exercise with the group and with the group, we normally start out slow, do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up. And while we're walking, we talk and visit with each other.

As far as the words that I was speaking, the words were correct, but they were not making sense as complete words. So I said, I knew there was something wrong. My friends knew there was something wrong. So when I got through the exercise class, we spent an hour exercising together. I went home and had breakfast. And I told Patty, I said, there's something wrong. I need to go to the doctor now. I want her to take me to my heart doctor. And she decided that rather than that, would take me to the emergency room. And there at the emergency room, they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke. And so I spent the next three days. There was a problem with my heart. My heart was beating too fast and out of rhythm. And so they spent most of the time for the next two or three days correcting that issue. And then after they corrected that, then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia and then discovered that I'd had a stroke and had aphasia. So that's pretty much where I am. Yeah. That sounds like it could have been really scary, but you just handled it like it was another day. Well, I tried to. No, I really didn't. I just thought I had a headache. And talking with Patty later, she said on the Wednesday, the day before I woke up with a headache, she said, you had a headache that day too, like Wednesday night late.

And sure enough, that's what Cinderella mostly did. She mostly warped terribly. And the other three daughters were, of course, hideous and vicious. And they didn't stay in the apartment. Anyway, they had another spot, a servant's quarters that they had to keep. It was a beautiful day. You could see the king's castle twinkling in everybody's eyes as they looked besides. But luckily, there was something that helped Cinderella during this time, mostly some rodents that appeared constantly in what would have been, I guess, a very needy, would have needed a, oops, can't do it. Never mind. Let's forget that part. And also, there was a horse lying around and, I think, maybe a dog as well. At that point, the two other daughters of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today, presumably for the prince's birthday or something like that. And there, Cinderella thought, oh, this is going to be fun. She got a little dress herself. And yet, the two nasty daughters said, no. She's not going to come. She can't stay. She's a servant. And they were the old bourgeoisie of the place. So they said, fine. There's just no point in her being here. Fortunately for Cinderella, who would have been, no doubt, weeping for the misery of not being at the castle, Cinderella had a fairy godmother who told her about this. And she said, well, fine.

But they said, no, you can't do that. Only the terrible creatures that were living in the house are the only ones that could really do this. Then there came a, what do you call those creatures, a magic personage? Anyway, this magic personage wanted to change all of the things that Cinderella wanted to read. She wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened. And it was this magical creature that made that all possible. Then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw the prince, and the prince was quite enchanted by the prince completely. Whereas the horrible creatures that lived in the house had no real particular interest in the prince. Sooner or later then, the prince was doing quite well, but it was time for Cinderella to leave because she had to do that. Eventually the wonderful time that they had disappeared. Nevertheless, everybody wanted to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for. And yet that was not to be the case.

And then, so she says, great, you know, I've got my $2 daughters and she can be, you know, they can all be friends. Well, when she's gone, it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend. She must've been sleeping in the stable with the animals, I guess. She, in one picture, she was making tea for the two daughters. She was doing their laundry. She was doing all the work. And like I said, she had become more of a slave than anything else. So they lived in the shadow of the castle. And I think she dreamt about the castle and it looks like she was, in one picture, it looks like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that, that's what it looks like in a way.

So he sent out this invitation. And of course, the wicked stepmother, whatever she is, the mother, she, of course, doesn't want Cinderella to go to the ball.

Why are we not going to do something for her?

But he is very, very good at working with stroke people in terms of cognitive ability. And I worked with him for almost four years. And in fact, I just quit working with him maybe in the last six months. We went to his office, went to where he had an office. He didn't have an office there. He had a, he came to a university here and he would meet with people there at the university. And I was still in a wheelchair at that time. And I worked with him while I was still in a wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was, when I was actually in a walker for another year. And then when I went to walking with a cane, I continued working with him. But it is, which I could explain exactly how, what he does, but he works with the cognitive abilities and he helped me a lot. In fact, some of the things that we've done here reminded me of some of the stuff that he's done that he did with me, now I'm telling stories and a lot of different tests that he's done.

And while I was there, I usually read the first section of the paper and I opened it up and I could not read what was on the newspaper.

When I got to work, I tried to log in to my computer at the office. I couldn't remember my login. I didn't know how to log in and I still had the headache. I talked to my boss and told her what was going on. She said, just take it easy for a while and see if you can later. Remember, I took probably a half hour, 45 minutes and still couldn't. So I said, I just can't do it. I'm going to go home. I came home, took a couple more aspirin, and went to bed and slept the rest of that day. That was on a Thursday. On Friday morning, I got up and I exercised on Friday, Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays, I exercised in the group early in the morning. So I went to exercise class and I exercised.

So her dad, her father met this other woman and decided he'd like to have him and her get married. And as I always watched it, probably most of us seeing that would go, oh no, don't be marrying this particular person, but he did. And that person had a couple, sorry, a couple like daughters that she owned. And it's shown that they're all very, very mean, not only to Cinderella, but even to themselves. They just, they're just very, all they think about is themself. And the mother is just interested in trying to make a lot of money when she gets married. So they realized that Cinderella is just a very beautiful person. I mean, she's very pretty and beautiful, but she's inside. She's just a really sweet person who cares about people. So the, oh, I think it's called stepmother. I think that's what it's called, realizes she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters. And so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy, wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life, because all that she can do is constantly clean and wash and whatever else she has to do, cook for the other three people. But yet during that time, Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy, at least for the most part, and just doing a lot of lovely things and taking care of them.

She waited on everybody. And the girl, the two daughters treated her like a slob or like a slave and she just had to pick up after them. Then they got an invitation to a ball that was being held in honor of the prince. So Cinderella did all the work to clean it up, to get it, everybody, everything ready. And she made her own gown. And when she went to join the two daughters and the mother for the dance or for the ball, they destroyed her dress and they told her that she couldn't go. She went and was within tears and her friends, which were like the cat and the horse and there were three or four animals and they all tried to cheer her up. And she had been dreaming of going and she now couldn't go. So then the fairy godmother appeared and told her that she could go and she turned the horses into footmen. She created the carriage and she created a ball gown for her to go. And so they went to the, excuse me, they went to the ball and the Cinderella got to dance with the prince and she was attracted to him and she wanted to marry him. But then her, she went, she ran because she was only allowed to go till midnight. So she, when she realized she stayed late, she went running home. She lost the glass slipper, it fell.

And when we went down the road, I don't remember who or how it was decided which hospital I was going to, but I think I went to the best possible one. And when we got there, there was like four of them on a row down there. We call this hospital row. So my street is always the first in the city to get paved. Well, maybe the governor's and then mine. Then she didn't understand where to go exactly. I think she knew she went to the emergency room, but didn't know where it was. And I saw the red lettering and I couldn't read it. That is so significant to me because I remember I could not read that word. I knew what the word was, but I couldn't say it to save my life. But what I could say, I just couldn't read it. And so I pointed and I said emergency. And so I wasn't reading it. It was like it's red and I just know what that word is because it's red. And so we got to the entrance and there was like, I want to say canopy, but not really canopy, but something to keep you out of the rain and overhang or whatever. And I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or standing there. His job is to check people for weapons before they get into the hospital. And I waved at him and motioned for him to come and he did. And I told him, I think I've had a stroke. And I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility. I don't even remember. But I said, but I'm afraid to walk. And I was walking fine, but I just never had a stroke before. So I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now and all of a sudden I can't. I didn't know. So I was afraid to walk. And so he said, hold on, I'm going to get someone. And a nurse came out real fast and she came out first. And then I told the same thing to her and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair. I think it was just inside the door. And so she got me in the wheelchair and we went in. And I remember looking at the people in the waiting room, it was pretty full and I felt kind of guilty because I was being rushed to the head of the line. And I almost wanted to say, sorry, but I think I had a stroke, but you know, just not appropriate to really say anything. I just felt bad. And so then the intake person wanted my health insurance card. So I gave her that. And she asked me, am I on any medications? And I remembered the Metformin, but I called it Glucovage. I think Glucovage is, I think that's the name brand for it, but I couldn't think of Metformin. And there were a lot of supplements I used to take and maybe a couple more meds.

So I did get to remember, I had to start up another time. So it did help. I mean, my mom helped me in different places. They helped everything about it, but it was nice to get back up where you can go. The bottom, I mean, it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down. I'd go up and you had another time to keep getting better than you were. So it's been nice to keep going. If you keep doing a little bit to read and write, everything like that, it helps a lot better. Now I'm going to show you these pictures. Again, just take a little time to look at them. They tell a story. Take a look at all of them. And then I'll ask you to tell me the story with the beginning, a middle, and an end. And you can look at the pictures as you tell the story and you can start whenever you are ready. Okay, the boy was outside with the soccer ball. He's kicking around and he kicked one really good, but he hit right in the middle of the window on the house there. So the next one over there, looks like her dad. He might've been sleeping and jumped out pretty good when the soccer ball went through the window into the house and the lamp broke down there too. But you really can't tell on number four. I can't see with my picture and you and Anne. I can't see what number four is on there really. So if you click on my face, there should be a way to move the box to where you can see four. Which one are you saying? So if you click on this small screen with my face on it, if you click it and drag. View options. No, just like actually on my face, there should be a little, your cursor should change. Is it on the top or the bottom? In the middle. Click and then you can drag it and move the box. Good idea here, hang on a minute. I'm just going to show you on. Hey mom, do you know why you want to move this? So you know how to move this out of the way? Cause I can't see the last one here. How do I move that? You'll click on the window with my face on it and drag it across the screen. Click here and then drag it across. Ah, I gotcha. It looks like he is not very happy cause he got his soccer ball, but he's still looking out there. I think the boy must've ran away. He ran away so, cause he's still looking to see what he's doing."}, {"filename": "NEURAL52-2_1778377_2009248.wav", "transcript": "And maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was kind of inspire me to keep going and working, working, working. So I did that, and I worked hard on that. And I worked hard when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me, I went to the YMCA and got a membership in the Y and hired at the Y a personal trainer who didn't really know anything about strokes, but she learned. She was very good at studying and learning. The first time that she saw me, and I was so stiff that I couldn't move, like I couldn't move anything. My arm was just, I don't know if you can see it here. You know, your arm is just like this and it's clenched fist and everything. And the first time she tried to move my arm, it was like, holy cow, I can't move it, you know? And it wouldn't move. She worked with me. I went twice a week to go with her. And then in addition to that, after a while, I went, started, I'd say, Sharon, take me down to the Y and let me, I was still using my walker. I'd say, let me, just take me down to the Y and let me walk around the track with my walker. And I'm sure people thought I was stupid, so here's this little guy walking around with his, you know, very, very slowly, take me, you know, take me, it's a six times around this track for a mile. And it would take me a half hour to walk around that lap. But I was determined to do it. And I did it. I did it. And then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane. I still go very slowly. I'm doing it. So I'm gonna have to say, the biggest thing that made me get better was myself. Made me get better was myself. And I'm not trying to pat myself on the back. I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have, and I'm sorry for them that they don't. But I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive. I did not lose my drive. I've always been kind of driven anyway. You know, I've always been driven. But I was driven to her to improve and to get better. I'm still doing that, and I'm getting there. And it will never come to an end, but I will keep working at it. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you? Could be happy or sad or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently. Okay."}, {"filename": "NEURAL74-2_498523_729147.wav", "transcript": "Well, I think the best thing that happened was I got a great therapist and she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction and finding what needed to be done and then working with me to get that. But basically I went therapy three times a week for several months and then dropped down to a couple of times a week. And we, until finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us, or, you know, I'd already done all of them and reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it. So, yeah. But starting, I've got a squirrel running across my patio, nevermind, I'll let go of that one. But part of it, starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures that we saw with all the drawings of different things. I had the same thing sitting, go in a room, sit in here, look around and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud. Until I can figure, you know, sometimes, you know all these words, you know all these items, but you don't, not able to pull those words out. And the same thing driving down the street, you look at, say a mailbox, say that word out loud, mailbox, post office, you know, and hedges, whatever. You know, whatever you see, make a name, you know, bring a name for that item. And it's something that I've kept along with all the, as long as I've had aphasia now, is, you know, when I look at something, I'll say the name of that item just to keep it going. So that's one of the things I do all the time. I don't even think about it a lot of times, it's just something automatic to do. Here are some more pictures. They also tell a story. So take a second to look at them and then tell me whatever story that you see. The beginning, a middle, and end. Okay, the boy was out playing in the yard, kicking a soccer ball. He kicked the soccer ball a little too hard in the wrong way and it hit a window and broke. The window fell through right next to our lamp inside the house and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor. I'm not sure who this person is, whether it's his father or his neighbor. And then the adult was watching out of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broke his window. Do you think he's looking out angrily or you think he's just curious? Well, at this point, we don't see his face."}, {"filename": "NEURAL57-2_225351_455117.wav", "transcript": "Um, I think at the beginning, um, the first thing they were helping me to stand up, um, to be able to walk again. They were more into that at the very beginning than other like, um, aphasia type stuff. They wanted to make sure I was able to, to walk again and because my one side of my, um, body was starting to have trouble, they said, so they wanted you to start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning. They started doing some little tasks for me, like, um, we played cards to see how many cards I can find, looked at some numbers, some letters, stuff like that, but we were doing that just here and there feeling. Um, I was also very sad, very, um, emotional feeling. Didn't, I couldn't even remember who I was and so, um, getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are, I was more panicked than that kind of stuff. Um, once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many years to, uh, days, I figured out how people were that I remembered. So, um, said, let's go for our therapy now. Let's start walking around and stuff. So, once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit, um, we started working on therapy and, um, they said, you have aphasia. Um, and my talking, I couldn't say pretty much any, I couldn't say anything. They were saying, like, do you want something to eat? I didn't understand what that meant. So, they give me, like, a cup. Do you want something to drink? They take the cup and show me and I go, yes or no. It took me a little, even harder to understand that this goes this way. If you want it, if you don't want it, it goes this way. Took that long to figure that out. Little things like that, that I didn't remember. Um, then once I was able to at least think a little bit more, we started with, um, uh, pictures like that bird and the, and the boy and the banana. And, uh, we started, that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words. And, um, my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name, my kids and everything else. So, still working on therapy myself. I have a, a book at home that I still do my homework every day. So, still going. I, I'm, um, the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write. And I said, but I told myself that I'm going to do it. So, I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up. So, you know, I'm going to read someday and I will write. And I will have numbers at some point. So, yeah. Um, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that has happened to you in your life?

I think that's about right. And I think last thing I'm saying is, I think that I might've thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit. And so I was thinking about that and praying about that. And that's the last thing I can tell you. We were going to the hospital and I was trying, she was asking me a lot of questions as she was driving. And I was doing the best I could, but I couldn't really explain very well.

And as she's running down, her slipper, grass slipper, they call it, or whatever, falls and she has to keep running. So then I think the pictures show that she's back home and she's just happy that she got to do something. And then they find out that oh boy, my brain, that there was a grass slipper, or they're gonna find who was that woman who actually would of course have been Cinderella. And so they go to every unmarried young woman and none of them, it doesn't fit right with any of them, with the slipper, grass slipper, I can't talk with the slipper. And it does for Cinderella. And so she becomes married. And I think I missed one thing in there. It seems like the mom ends up breaking that or something first, I don't remember that. But anyway, they find the other one, like I say, and that fits, that's the only one that fits right. And it's obviously, she's the one. And then it shows that they get married and they're happily ever after. I think that's it. Can you tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Yeah, you open up each of the like jellies. Each of the like, sorry, each of the like jellies. Excuse me, let me start over again. Peanut butters and jelly.

And it was just, and so I would make these little videos and I would tell him, you're going to have to come and see granny and help me with these sores. They're out of control. They're into my computer and they're going to mess up my work and they're into my freezer and I'm not going to be able to cook because they're messing with all this food and everything. And he thought those little stupid little videos, maybe two minutes long each, he thought those were hilarious and he would watch them over and over and over and over again because that's what little kids do when they like a video, you know, they do this a hundred times, you know. And then his baby brother came along and I think there's a two years difference. Yeah, two years. And so the baby, he's just as cute as he can be. And so he's right about almost two and so much difference between the two and their personalities. But the first one, he's a super smart. He's also very manipulative, you know. And so he works that cuteness angle, you know. And then the second one, he was a lot more agreeable. He was plenty smart, but I could tell not to the level his brother is. You know, it's like he didn't get stuck quite as quickly as like you had to work with him a while. And, but then he did and he was fine. I think he just likes to analyze maybe more, you know, and just to think things through. So the second one, just a super long eyelashes for any girl would love to have. And this is just as cute as he can be. And I went to go see them last Thanksgiving I think it was, or Christmas, it was last Christmas. I went to go see them Christmas and I FaceTime with them a lot. And so the older one, he's thrilled to see me and he just runs to me and, you know, says Granny, you know, wants me to pick him up and everything. But the baby, even though he'd seen my face a lot on the screen and of course I'd seen him in person too, but not real often, it took him a minute. He had to watch his older brother. Like, I guess it's okay to go sit near her. It was like, it seemed like at some point a light switched on with him and he was like, she's fine. So then I had both on my lap and they just, for about an hour or two, I was enjoying celebrity status. It was just cool.

Oh, I forgot the beginning and the end last time. Okay, the beginning is that the little kid, I think it's a boy, is going off to school, and mom tries to hand him an umbrella. And he says, mom, I don't need an umbrella. I'm a big kid, I don't need an umbrella. It's not gonna rain. I'll walk, I'll be okay. So, he waves goodbye to the mom, he's got his backpack on, head for school, waves, tells mom goodbye, and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't want to take with him. So, he starts walking off to school, and there's some raindrops, coming down, not a lot, but just a few raindrops here and there. And he looks up at the sky, and he's like, oh no, what did I do? I didn't bring the umbrella. So, he said, I think I'll go home and get the umbrella. And he turns around, and it's raining harder, and now the wind's kind of blowing, because the rain's coming at an angle, and it's quite a bit of rain, because as he runs, he's splashing. So, there's enough rain that it's making splashes. And he's kind of holding his hand up over his head, as though he's gonna be able to stop the water off his head. But he runs home, and you can tell, see, the mom is a little perturbed, because he wouldn't take the umbrella. So, there he is, all wet, head to toe wet, dripping wet. And the mom just kind of looks at him like, you know, you should have listened to what he said. You should have listened to what he said. And he said, okay, I'll, okay. So, give him the umbrella. So, she gives him the umbrella, and he heads back to school. And it's still raining, still raining pretty hard, coming down at an angle, even more of an angle than it was. So, it must be blowing pretty hard, about a four to five degree angle. And he's walking, he's got his backpack, and he's walking off to school. And the moral of the story is, listen to your mom.

He's like, I'm here on this ranch and I'm happy so y'all can worry about all you want but I might come down. So the little girl says, you know, daddy, daddy, daddy. And she's a little girl, probably, I don't know. She's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle. He's got pigtails and little black sandals. Like I said, she's riding a tricycle. The cat won't come down. So apparently the dad must have gone up the tree to get the cat down and he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there and something happened. I'm gonna guess maybe the dog is barking up the tree. I ran into the ladder or something but something hit the ladder and knocked it down. The dad's stuck in the tree. And I don't know who called the fire department unless he had a cell phone, maybe it's, maybe, I don't know. That's it, he must have had a cell phone.

So, the like, let me check where they are. So, it's made by decree that they should have this like ball where in the ball every girl that is not married needs to, has to come there and then they'll be able to figure out who's the best one that he should marry.

It cannot be fixed at all, I mean, like I said, the leg and the knee are it. So I was probably out for, I don't know, at least four weeks, five weeks. Then even though, I mean, I didn't know what the heck was going on, I was mud. So they worked on it, they, you know, did some facts on it. After what, about seven, no, six weeks, seven weeks, they then, they took me out of that, working on my, things that were supposed to, they were trying to fix, okay, speech, whatever. Then for the next four months, four months, they did some more work. I mean, I didn't even, but after that, by the end, by the middle, they went six weeks, then they went another, I don't know, four weeks. I mean, I didn't, I knew what was going on, but I was, I might as well have been out of it. And my sister, my brother said that my speech started coming together at that point.

So I was, it was on a Friday. It was June 10, 2011. I had just finished the first day of a conference of airway management. And it was time to go to have dinner. So my partner and I went downstairs and we were out of the hotel for approximately, you know, maybe one minute. And I did not notice what was happening, but she saw me dropping my purse and then she stayed behind and she yelled to me, Jenny, you dropped your purse. So I turned around and again, I didn't notice anything. But when she saw me, she was like, oh my God, something's really wrong. My, according to her, my face was already distorted. And in retrospect, I realized that I was not able to speak because she tried to, you know, tell me we need to go back. And I kept saying, no, no, no. But that's all I was saying. Okay. So eventually, let's see. All right. I started noticing things that were kind of out of whack, for example. At some point, I was really smiling on this side and and I felt the emotion of kind of like a bursting out into laughing. But then on this side, then I was feeling very sad and I could feel the emotion and it's like, you know, what's going on? And then all of a sudden I noticed that my eyes were deviated to the left, which in retrospect, I know that when you have a brain lesion, you guys, the eyes deviate to the left or to the right, depending on what the lesion is. Anyway, so finally, they went ahead and took me to the hotel once again. Eva, my partner, went ahead and recruited some people that ushered me back to the hotel. And there was a medical conference that I was taking. So it was a whole bunch of doctors there. So one doctor came out and then he saw me and said, she's got a stroke. And then proceeded to elevate my neck. And that was the most painful experience I have ever, ever had. And then we waited for the ambulance to get by, I mean, to come in and they did my vitals. And the hospital was about five blocks away from where the stroke happened. And they were able to start TPA, which is, TPN, TPA, sorry, which is an anti-clotting medicine.

So I went to the registry, got into an office with a state trooper, and he looks at me and he says, Mr. Flynn, where are you going? I said, well, I'm hoping to get my license. He says, I think not. I said, why is that? Because you haven't filled up all that information. I said, yeah, I understand that, but I can't write. I can't communicate that way. He said, it's not my problem, that's your problem. I said, yeah, and I just want to tell you one more thing, too. He said, by the way, you're a bastard. I said, what did you say?

Because I need to know what it is like for other people who have strokes. Being your license, getting a license is one thing, being a friend is another thing. I said, you're right.

So there was no therapy. You just are able to survive. It's like you're able to just get discharged from the hospital and go home. And because they just did not do therapy in those years. And over the course of the next 20 years, my wife and I found out about, from people that had had therapy brain injuries later, that the divorce rate amongst the brain injured approaches 90%. And the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five times the national average. That's what they're telling people even 15 years ago. And so I wanted to share that with patients at RHI, just to give them hope that recovery is possible, but it just takes a long time. And in 04, when I started there at RHI, I heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families, a year to year and a half recovery, year to year and a half recovery, year to year and a half recovery. Hey, you don't stop recovering. The rate may be asymptotic, if you will, and slow down pretty radically after a year to year and a half, but you never, never stopped recovering.

So they put me to sleep for that, and when they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to do, I was horrified. I don't like to be put under, I like to know what's going on. And then they're going to put this thing down my throat, and I know that there is the possibility, it's so slim, but possibility that something could go wrong there, or some permanent damage could happen. And so I was pretty freaked out about it, but I thought I gotta submit to this, so they did that. And when they did either a CT scan or the MRI, I don't remember which, I've had those done before, not in the brain though, and they told me it was really important that I lay perfectly still.

Now I didn't feel any physical pain, I wasn't drawn here, my lips were fine, I wasn't paralyzed or anything, everything physically felt great, but my communication wasn't right, but I didn't really know it at that point in time. And so within, my son called back within a few minutes, my wife came home and she said, I think we have to go to the doctor, but I battled a little bit, no, I'm okay, that type of a thing. And she said, no, she said, you're just not making sense, just let it get checked out. And we went, so there was an urgent care a few minutes away, I walked into the urgent care, still feeling good, we were probably there. I walked in, we signed in, gave the insurance card, did all that, went into the office where the physician was going to come in, the gal came in, the nurse came in to start to take my pressure, and then I passed out, and after that I don't remember a lot of things."}, {"filename": "NEURAL63-1_964827_1111358.wav", "transcript": "Okay, Cinderella was introduced by her two sisters and her mother, and they told them she couldn't go to the...

So just look at the photos and tell me what's in them. All right, what I'm guessing from this is the child is getting ready to leave for school from his home. And I would say his mother is saying, you should take an umbrella. And I'm assuming the son does not want to take the umbrella. And so the mother does not force him to take the umbrella.

There's, there's, I know what they are, they're firemen running towards the tree. So I'm guessing that there was a bird in the tree, the cat may have run up the tree after the bird. Perhaps the young girl maybe wanted the cat out of the tree. So then I'm guessing a man tried to help by climbing up the tree on a ladder, and then the ladder fell over once he was in the tree. So now he's stuck in the tree. I think the dog is upset and just perhaps, maybe the guy came over with the dog and now the dog's upset his owner's in the tree.

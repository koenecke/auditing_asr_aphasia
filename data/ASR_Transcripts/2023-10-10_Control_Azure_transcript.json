What I do is probably. Not the kindest way to do it, but I will play a little passive aggressive with her and it sometimes works because if I pretend like I don't care and I don't want to know anything and I'm like fine, or you know, I just walk away. Usually a little bit later she will know that she's somehow impacted. I I think she knows she has hurt me in some way that she knows she's now withholding the information and. That my walking away is is because she knows I want more and because I care. It's like we have to go through a dance. It's like this dance to get a little bit more information. God, I do it because. Anything I can get, I'll take. Thinking back, we'd like you to tell a story about something important that happened in your life. It can be happy or sad. It could be from any time, childhood to now. Just anything that sticks out to you as being an important event. Whenever you're ready, you may begin. OK. This wasn't a single time. It was, I would say, every Sunday, just about every Sunday. There were some Sundays we missed, but we would go to my grandparents every Sunday and it was the highlight of my week, my grandparents, my momma's parents. We're just everything. That I wanted and thought was good about a marriage and a couple and his willingness to. Be chivalrous, but my grandma had her own mind. It's like he at that time was able to to play two roles that were interesting for a man at that time to play. But he did it. And so it was really important for me because I just lived with her. I just had my mom at home to see this really healthy dynamic between two people and everything was like clockwork. It was all predictable. I would get there. My grandpa would have. He always had a handful of nuts. Because there was a squirrel. Named PD, who lived in the tree in front of his house. Now I'm sure it wasn't just one PD, there were probably 20 PD, but I thought it was PD and I just always called pity. And so we would feed pity and then we would go inside and my grandma would always have cooked some kind of dinner. Late afternoon ish dinner. And it was always fancy. Like High Noon kind of dinner. And you know, everything was always homemade and wonderful and she laid out the table so beautifully and she'd always have the most amazing desserts. And so. We would do that.

To the Cinders, and she had to do all the chores for her two step sisters, and her stepmother didn't think much of her either, so she just had a terrible time. And then there was in this Kingdom where Cinderella lived, there was a. A king. And he decided that it was time for his son to get married. So he set out. An edict that all the eligible and young attractive women in the in the Kingdom would come for a ball, and they would have a ball on a certain night. And so the invitations went after all and sundry, and it came to the house where Cinderella lived with their two step sisters, and they were all eligible. But her two step sisters were not very pretty. So, but they got really excited and they got oh, they thought it would just be wonderful to have. Marvelous new clothes and marvelous, marvelous. That and Cinderella got excited too, and she thought it would be just great. But she found out that she was not going to be allowed to go to the bar and she would have to help her sisters get ready. And so then I came and they got themselves ready and they went off in a carriage and they were, you know, looking, looking down their nose at her, and she was ready to cry and all of a sudden. A fairy godmother showed up. Touched her. And she turned into this beautiful dress. And then there was a pumpkin, and she turned that into a coach. And then there was some mice, and she turned that into the horses. And she made this beautiful thing for this. That this Cinderella wasn't going to get to go to the bar and she had this lovely little glass slippers. But she said the one thing. You cannot stay out. After midnight. So when the clock starts to strike, you got to leave. You got to go before the clock starts to dry. So she went to the ball and when she got there. The Prince saw her and he looked, took one look at he just fell in love. And so he found her. And everybody else just had to stand back and wait, because that's all he could do, was to dance with this lovely young thing that he found. And they danced, and they danced all over the place and everybody else was sort of put to the side. But do you know what? She forgot that she had to leave at midnight. So the clock started to strike and she remembered. So she started flying down the steps to leave, but she lost her slipper and she flew out the door and by this time her carriage turned into a pumpkin and her horsemen had turned into mice. But she finally got home. I forgot exactly how, but she got home and there she was by the again but in the cinders by the fireplace and the other two daughters came home. They had that story to tell, but. Along came an envoy from the. Kingdom. And he said, we're trying to find a girl who belongs to this slipper. And of course, the mother, the stepmothers that will go back to the kitchen, to the centers. We can't fool with you."}, {"segment_name": "UMD24_990255_1230182.wav", "azure_transcription": "Once Upon a time, there was a little girl named Ella. She was the daughter of two loving parents. Only one day, when she's a little girl, her mother dies. Suddenly it's very tragic. Everybody cries. Everybody like her mother. Her father, in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom, goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own. All three women, unfortunately, are spiteful, jealous creatures. He brings them all home to his lovely manner. Where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella, but mostly keep it under wraps until the father, partly out of heartbreak and partly out just a really bad diet, also dies. At this point, the step sisters and the stepmother turned Cinderella basically into a skivvy. And make her run around working all the time, and then begin mocking her for being dirty and they call her Cinderella. Now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are. So one day, when the Prince has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all of the other rides in the joint, all the other potential brides and princesses and the adjoining lands, decides he will marry one of his own people. Or perhaps he's commanded to hold the ball. And he will invite all of the eligible women of his Kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match. So the stepmother and the step sisters are very excited about this. They spend. Almost all of the money they have on beautiful, beautiful gowns. Cinderella is. Both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go to just to get out of the house, have a bit of glamour. But of course, they won't let. Because they they tell her that she would be an embarrassment, but mostly they don't want the competition. So they go off to the ball and Cinderella is left alone, sort of broken hearted and downcast and. Basically an empty house and she begins crying. She's just crying and crying by the fireplace when. All of a sudden, a woman materializes from the flames and says. Cinderella, why are you crying? Cinderella says. I just. I just wanted to go to the ball. I just wanted one night of happiness and joy. And the woman says, Ohh, well, I am your fairy godmother and is within my power to grant this. So can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs? And. You're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers and so that will do. And she waves her wand and the pumpkin turns into a carriage and her her dress rags turn into a beautiful, glorious ball gown and her slippers and two slippers of cut glass. None. Nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling. And she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachman. Cinderella is just overcome with joy and and she gets into the carriage and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairy godmother says. Unfortunately my magic power is limited and at midnight when the chimes. Go. Everything will turn back, so make sure that you are. Well away from the ball and and out of. You know, an embarrassing, compromising situation before that happens. I will, I will. And she waves goodbye and she goes off to the ball. She arrives, and it's even more dazzling than she thought. She comes in and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming. And. In the midst of of her being greeted by by throngs of. Enchanted admirers. The Prince looks up and he sees her and he asks her to dance. And they begin to dance. And of course they're both super hot, so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they've. Really cute kids together.

Help make up for that. And so she cleans the place with all the help of the woodland creatures who like the way she sings, like deer and birds and bunnies. I don't know. I think Thumper shows up. So she cleans the whole place and it's sparkling, and then she yawns and falls all across the beds. There are seven of them and she just falls all across them and it's about her height, give or take. And so she passes out there. And about this time, all of the dwarves are marching home from work. Hi ho hi ho, they work in the mines. There is. Doc. Happy, Grumpy. Dopey, bashful. Sneezy. Happy talk. Sleepy. Sleepy. Sleepy. The 7th. OK, so there are those seven dwarfs, and they work in the mines, gathering precious gyms and whatnot and. They come marching home because of course it's their home. There are 7 little beds for seven little dorms. And they enter their home. And they see this strange woman passed out across their beds. Probably went to one too many parties. They don't know. And so they go up to her and they wake her up. And she wakes up surrounded by 7 tiny men and doesn't panic. I don't know what's up with that. Um. And. So she explains her situation and because she's so dull faced and innocent looking, the dorms are all like, yeah, OK, I believe you, you can stay with us as long as you're in danger, as long as you keep cleaning up the place and like make her food and stuff. And since she's been working as a servant, she's cool with that. And so she lives with them happily for some time. And then. The Evil Queen has been sitting snug in her castle thinking that she's killed Snow White. And then one day she saunters up to the magic mirror and she says mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? And the mirror says still still Snow White. Still. You didn't kill her. And the evil Queen flies into a rage and she decides if you're gonna do something right, do it yourself. She probably kills the Huntsman. Probably interrogates him and then kills him. But I think Disney left that out because they're nice. Umm. So she goes down to her lair, where she makes all her potions, because as an evil queen, that's something you're required to have. And she makes this potion. That she dips a white apple into and pulls it out and it is red as blood. And it is of course a poison apple because that is how she rolls. And she puts this poison apple in with the basket of regular apples, hopefully not getting them confused. I assume it's like magically red and delicious looking. I wouldn't eat it. That probably means that it's been dramatically modified. But then she disguised herself as this old Crone, and she marches off into the forest. I'm not. I don't remember how she found Snow White, but presumably she just went knocking on every little cottage in the woods until she found her. And all the doors are off to work and Snow White is sitting in the house singing at her animal friends. Probably. And Snow White enters the door and says, oh look, an old Crone with a magically delicious looking apple. I'm probably completely safe. And the old friend says, what do you like? An apple, child? And she says, Yep, still safe. And she takes the apple and the Crone says yes, child age the apple."}, {"segment_name": "richardson36_270024_509940.wav", "azure_transcription": "That's right.

Take a look at all of them and then I'm going to ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, OK? And you can look at these pictures as you tell the story. Alright, so this little boy's mother offered him an umbrella and he didn't want to take it because he didn't believe it rained so right. He started walking outside. It started raining and he gets mad and his stomping through the puddles wishing he had an umbrella. So he comes back to the house wet. And get some umbrella, then continues on his journey. Great, so here's another picture. I want you to look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end, alright. So this little girl was outside with her cat when her cat climbed up a tree. Her father thought he could rescue the cast, so I brought a ladder placed on the branch and climbed up. And then his ladder fell, so he stuck up in the tree with the cat. And for some reason the daughter can't lift the ladder up to help him out. So they had to call a fire department and the fire department came and the fire departments on their way to rescue with them to rescue the cat and the father. And I said great, thank you. OK, so now I'm gonna have you. This is again another story. This is Have you ever heard of Snow White? I've heard of that. That's that's fine. Take your time to look at those pictures or tell a story. I want you. Ohh, sorry. You know, the pictures will tell you pretty much about how it goes. I'm going to take the book away after you're done looking at the pictures, OK? And then ask you to tell me the story in your own words.    The magic mirror. Alright, so OK so um, now just tell me as much of the story of Snow White as you can and you can use any details that you know prior or what you just like that. So twist what I looked at. So there was. This queen. Who? With hoping she'd be. The most the fairest lady of the land. All right. And so she'd asked that her magic mirror, which had face in it. And she asked who's the fairest lady of them all? And usually the mirror would apply she is, but one day they're applied. Snow White is so the queen was upset and banished Snow White, and then Snow White was going through the forest and she found seven dwarfs. And for some reason she fell asleep.

And then I think they added this Cinder because she was dirty or something, because she had to clean anyway. So there's this girl, and she had a family and her father was a little while off and then her mother ended up dying and so her father. Her father remarried a woman, the evil stepmother, who had two daughters. Anastasia and maybe, I don't know, I remember they had like longer kind of mouthful names and. So they ended up moving in. And like the two sisters, like Bicker a lot. And the the step Mom didn't like? Cinderella. And then I think the father ended up dying. So now Cinderella was left with the evil stepmother and the two evil step sisters. And. This is so weird to tell it. And so then the evil stepmother was like. You're just going to be a mate in the house because she didn't really like her, so she like exiled her to like a rip in the attic and that made her pretty much a servant. And. One day. The Prince Prince Charming announced that he was having a ball, I think in order to look for a wife or something like that. And. The step sisters or the stepmother really wanted. The step sister got. The step sisters wanted to go to because they wanted to go meet the Prince and have their shot at him to see if they can marry him. And Cinderella is like, ohh, cool, maybe I'll go And the stepmother was like, yeah, no. Yeah. And so I think. Cinderella. Has her. Animal accomplices. I know one of the mice names Gasgas. I don't know if the other one and. Her animal and the birds and stuff, the singing birds, they make like a dress for her. She's like looking through, I think it was her mom stuff. So she gets an old dress with her moms and then they make it all pretty and stuff for her and so she's getting ready to go to the ball. And she walks downstairs. To go out and the sisters and the stepmother like rip her dress apart and rip off her jewelry because they don't want her going. And. I think maybe they locked her room or something. I don't know how she ends up getting out, but anyway, she ends up going to the ball or sneaking out to the ball or getting ready to go and then. The fairy godmother appears OK, she doesn't try to sneak out. The fairy godmother appears 1st and then it was like, ohh, let's turn you into a beautiful Princess and then she turns her gown into like this beautiful ball gown. She's in the woods somehow. I don't know how she got there, but she's in the woods. And the pumpkin that she's sitting on turns into a carrot and like her animal friends, turn into horses. And so then she goes to the ball. She makes this late, grand entrance. And the Prince is, like, very fascinated with her. And so they have a dance. But one of the conditions of this magic from the Fairy Godmother was that it expires at midnight. So. She's dancing with him and the clock strikes like symbolized that the time or like midnight is coming into."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto44a_1521526_1761360.wav", "azure_transcription": "OK, Cinderella lived in a house where two sisters in her evil.

And her two older sisters, they just had to run at a house. They just got to go to all the parties and play around the way. They wanted to do and no matter what, Cinderella said to her evil grandmother, Grandmother always took the side of the two older sisters. Well, every year they have this large dance. In town and it's just celebrate just the the harvest and all of that type of stuff. So they have this big party and everybody gets dressed up. There's all kind of. Food and dancing and so forth. And Cinderella's never been able to go. I mean, she's just always shunned because she's just. The dog, sort of, as far as the evil grandmother knows so. The two sisters come along and they get all dressed up and they're off to the party. Well. They're having such a wonderful time and poor Cinderella's at home and. She sort of beside herself, but all of a sudden. A fairy godmother appears to her and says, Cinderella, why are you sitting at home?

So the fairy godmother says, well, we're going to fix that today. And I'm going to get you a new gown and in fact, I'm going to dress you up so well that you are going to be the dream of the ball. So he. She helps her get all dressed up with this wonderful gown and. Gets all these fancy shoes and I think her her feet were made out of like glass slippers. They were probably like a a rock crystal. So she gets transported to the dance and me and her beauty is just so much that everybody is just startled at the dance. And in fact, you know, with the king and the queen and the Prince being there, the Prince. Justice really impressed with this Cinderella chip. And so they dance. And they dance, and they dance and they dance. And. The data seems to go by so quickly but all of a sudden. Cinderella hears the clock ringing. And the bells start chiming and she remembers that, her fairy godmother said That boy, you really need to be back home here before midnight or else you're going to turn back into the Cinderella person and all of this stuff. Is going to be washed away and everybody will know that it's just like a boy. So she starts running back to the carriage in which she came from, and in the process loses one of her shoes.

And they bring it up to her after much trial and error and Cinderella unlocks the door. She goes downstairs just as the shoe flies off one of the steps, sister's feet and smashes to the floor into a million pieces. They don't sweep it up immediately, which is weird to me because if I were walking around in bare feet, I would definitely want all the glass swept up. And everyone. Packs because. The Step sisters are upset because now there's no shoe to prove that they're the one that the Prince was dancing with. Obviously, that's the only reason they can't prove that. And the adviser is panicking because. King wants the Prince to get married. The Prince will only marry the person who fits the shoe, and they're all in a bit of a bind. And then Cinderella comes floating down the stairs and says but wait. I have the other sliver. And low and behold, she does in fact have the other slipper which stayed behind when everything else went to crap. I'm not really sure why. Very godmother works in mysterious ways. And so Cinderella goes. And she shows the slipper to prove that it is in fact the matching slipper. And then the advisor takes the slipper and slips it onto her foot. Her tiny foot. I don't think she should be able to stand in real life. And puts it on her and it fits beautifully, of course. And so. There was triumphant music. And they all lived happily ever after. The Princess? No Cinderella, she wasn't a Princess yet. Had to get the ring first. Cinderella went off to the castle, left her horrible life behind, and married the Prince. Probably still doesn't know her name. The end. The end. Alright, that's awesome. So too long now. That's great. OK, so now I'm going to have you do the same type of thing. Hold on, excellent, but for Snow White. OK. OK. So again, we've covered up all of the tight, so. Just look at the pictures and the less comprehensive knowledge of Snow White. So this will probably be shorter. That's fine.  She's very melodramatic. Look at this. Look at this. What is this face? I get that she's panicked, but that's still a weird face to make under the circumstances.  All right, so so it's no way the seven doors installed for somebody who vaguely remembers it? OK, good. So. Hmm. Now I'm not sure. If Snow White was actually a Princess or something before the Evil Queen usurped her throne, or if like she's the beautiful cousin or something and we're just waiting for the Evil Queen to die off before she, Snow White will ascend the throne. But in any case, there is this evil queen. She's got the high regal cheekbone. She could probably be nice looking if she wasn't so evil, so I don't know what she's so insecure about.

They didn't want her to have that dress. She did. She looked lovely, but they didn't want to admit it. So the stepmother looked at her as if to say, I have to watch you. So that was that.

Because we look better and we'll win. And the mother is going right along with everything. So he says. You go to your room and take care of what you have to do and take care of the house when we're gone and having a good time. So she goes. Back in her room and she's very sad.

The fairy godmother says have a great time, but you must be home by midnight because all this is going to disappear the magic at midnight. So she goes off. She goes to the ball and the Prince is dancing with everybody. And of course he sees Cinderella, who is by far the most beautiful in the room. He asked her to dance. They have many lovely dances. And then all of a sudden she tunes into a time. It is somehow, and she says I must leave. He says no, no, no. And she's like, no, I really must go. She starts to run off because it's almost about to strike midnight. She's running down the steps of the palace. She just gets into her. Pumpkin Chariot. She leaves. As she's running, she leaves a sandal stepper, what you call it, a beautiful pump on the steps, she as she goes the chariot turns back into a pumpkin. She manages to get home in time before the step. Sisters. And they come home and say what a wonderful time. They kind of tease her for being stuck at home and ask her what she did. And they dream about what a wonderful time. And then everybody learns the following morning that. Whoever the Prince was dancing with all night left her slipper behind and he is going throughout the lands to find who's foot fits the slipper. And it's a very delicate glass slipper. And so eventually they get to Cinderella's home. The two Mean Step sisters try to squish their big foot into it. Of course it doesn't fit.

So I was sort of surprised that I found it. So I made an appointment to get. Mammogram and I went in and got a mammogram and an ultrasound and I took my friend Dorothy with me. Umm. And the? Oncologist who was there said that I needed to get a biopsy because it appeared to be. Consistent with stage two cancer. So I called my sister, who's a nurse practitioner and generally has always handled my medical stuff.

May, June, July. It takes many months to compile enough information to be able to treat. Breast cancer and especially the first time, they like to make sure that they capture all the information so that they. Choose the best course of treatment, especially because I was 40. They view that as young and so it's pretty radical. So anyways, I have a whole bunch of series of all these Tests and months and months of agony and then ultimately have. I have a bilateral lumpectomy, so they found it in both sides actually after all the tests and. That was removed. My surgeon at Northwestern was great. Very comforting and confident, which is what I needed. And then my medical oncologist at Northwestern. So my surgical oncologist was finished with me after my surgery. The medical oncologist then created my plan for chemotherapy and radiation and then she worked with the doctor in Bloomington so that I could have my treatments here. So after I had my surgery a week later, they put my port in and the day that they put my port in, I started my treatments. So I went straight from the hospital over to. The where they administer the the drugs for chemo and. I had treatment every other week for a couple of months. And I. Recall sitting and just trying to think about how the drugs. Were awful and you can taste them, You can smell them. But. In your mind, you imagine how they are killing cells. They are. They are doing what they're supposed to be doing. So all of that said, that's I guess how I coped is to imagine. These things actually killing, being killed. After my chemo rounds, I did 30 rounds of radiation and that just made me tired. So that was OK and then that was right. I I finished chemo on my birthday November 6th. My radiation ended just after Christmas, so my goal was to move into 2017 with.

All the eligible maidens are invited to meet the Prince and Cinderella. Over here is her telling. The story to step sisters and she says, ohh I want to go. I'm eligible maiden and someone says of course you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done so. She makes up a bunch of chores her Cinderella to do what she says wash the floor. And someone says, well, I washed the floor yesterday, she said we'll do it again. And she had to do some ironing and some laundry and help her sister to get ready for the ball. And as she's helping her sisters get ready, she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons. And when they're done, she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress as an old trunk that used to be her mother's. And she shows the mice her beautiful dress and shows them. The beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away, and she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress. But the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL39-2_21554_261148.wav", "azure_transcription": "Another injury. All right, so last time I'm going to tell you different. See last time we went through sewing my finger on the sewing machine and cutting my heel almost off on the bicycle. So since I've not been injured, I've been lucky as an adult. So I have to go with another childhood. I had an older brother, I have an older brother and we were running around the neighborhood like you did then, and the boys decided to shimmy a tree. To get the to the top of a wheel, a wheelchair like that wheelchair, my brain. To get through the top of a tool shed. So I followed suit to keep up with him and I shimmied the tree and got to the roof of the tool shed. But I was pretty scraped up from and I decided I didn't like. Following state with the shimming of a tree so they shimmy down. I was not going to shimmy down, so my brother. That little Buzzard. He put a pile of leaves. Together for me to jump into from the top of the roof. Needless to say, I've finally got the nerve to jump off the top of the roof. And yes, I broke my foot. He helped me hobble home and try to. My mom was trying to soak it and all that stuff. But no, I wound up with the cast. So the recovery of that was the fact that you have a cast, so you had to stay propped for a little bit. But mine is that it was a walking cast. I was fine. That's what I remember of that. So my next question is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we leave that pretty broad, any type of difficulty communicating, but what I'd like to know is what? The issues were and what you do about those issues or did. I'm going to have to tell the same story. So that's the special needs from the First Baptist Church where I was there Sunday school teacher for 10 years and still go to Eagle Hari with them for special needs retreat. It's a group of about 5 to 600 special needs, most of which many do not communicate. There's a number of activities that they do with each other, but then there's a lot of group activities, which includes like the big square. Plants, so you just help them whether it's wheelchair bound or whether they. Have a hard time walking, but most of the time there is a speech problem and you just sometimes nod your head because there's a lot going on and it's hard for them to communicate and hear over top of it. The three boys that I spoke of last were all brothers, of which only one communicates. I mean, yeah, one communicates, the other two don't. It's a series of grunts, some sign language over the years. Of course, learned the girlfriend, and this means one is engaged to Becca. We have her wedding ring upstairs. He brings money in his pocket. That's his dowry, so that he could pay for the wedding. He does not communicate, but through his sign, it's just a matter of time before you figure out what he's saying. His, his sister and his mom usually knows that they are communicators, but it's just. They're communicators for them, put it that way. They will continue on with hand gestures until you get the gist of what they're speaking with, so it's just a matter of patience and waiting until you get the correct answer and by facial expressions you know."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto56a_141455_381040.wav", "azure_transcription": "This last spring I was down in the basement doing some work and I decided to come flying up the steps and I flew up, but the problem was I had both hands full of papers.

There was and I thought, well, I can get up. But I couldn't get up. There was no way I could get up. So there I was. And I I guess I went in and out. I don't really remember, but there was a little ending. I couldn't get up, but I couldn't call anybody. So I just lay there for a while and I thought, well, my husband is in the kitchen and he's watching TV. And maybe I'll be able to get up later and I won't tell him that I was so foolish as to come up the steps and fall. So I'll lay there a little bit longer and I woke up again and I. Couldn't get up. So I'm just leaving and I kept going in and out and finally sometime later it was at least 30 minutes. You bothered by the door and the door from the from the. Flower was up down to the stairs. So we looked at, I said what are you doing down there? And I said I can't get up. And he said, well that won't do. So he came down and he tried to get me up and I tried to get up, which was not the thing we should have done, but I couldn't. I couldn't move. So he said we need to call the ambulance and I said Oh no, I'll be able to get up. And he said. We really want to call the ambulance, but my next door neighbor was a urologist and her his wife was a nurse and I said well maybe you can call them. So he called them and they came over and the the doctor looked at me and he said call the ambulance. So we call the ambulance and then we called my daughter who's also lives in Lexington and she met us at the Hut there. She came to the house and so on and the ambulance came with the fire truck came and we got it. When they brought us, they they brought them because I had a neck injury. Obviously. I couldn't move, my neck couldn't get up. They brought the big things that come under the body and they brought it in and from each side and these two big burly men working on either side of me trying to get me up into the landing wasn't all that wide. They finally got me out and they didn't want me to move it all. So they carted me up the stairs and I don't remember this, but everybody else has laughed about ever since, they said. What's your other? She doesn't play as much as the 6th. So this is been the joke with the whole thing. They got me up and we they were absolutely marvelous. On the way to the hospital, they kept telling me where they were and it wouldn't be too much longer because it really wasn't paying. And I got to the hospital and of course they called ahead. That took me straight through to critical care and they were, they were ready for me and the rest of the night. I was in and out, but I had marvelous care. I had marvelous. People who were. Professionals who were working with me all night long. And they kept trying to check and be sure I didn't have any brain damage. I didn't have any nerve damage. But I had a broken neck. The 2nd cervical was broken. So they. That had the they had this cast on me the minute that they were there. They had already put a cast on me as I was getting ready to come to the hospital.

You've been on several antibiotics. I still was running. Of low grade fever and being nauseated at night. And.

For whatever reason that he doesn't know, and I don't know, he sent me for a colonoscopy. Thought that was kind of unusual about her ticket to call plane ticket to California. And so he got on the phone to find somebody that would do it the next day and he did find a surgeon he would and. Onion for the colonoscopy and. They kind of put you out and when I got up off the table, I said, well, did you find anything? And he said yes, and I said cancer, and he said yes. And I'm like, well, what do we do next? And he said. We'll talk about that Monday and. So Mandy explained to me the extent to what I had. He thought it was contained within the colon, but wouldn't really be sure until the operation. And so they scheduled the operation, believe it or not, two weeks down the road. And I said then I'm going to California, I'm not gonna sit around here and. Worry about this, you know, two weeks. I just couldn't believe that in this day and age that if you had cancer, they would schedule you two weeks down the road. The doctor called me that night and asked me some questions and we thought it was really unusual to have a doctor call you. That doesn't happen very often. And the next morning is nurse called me at 7:00 from the hospital and. They were doing surgery, she said We can get you in Friday if you'll stay and I said, well if you can get me on Friday, then I'll stay. So I'll schedule for surgery Friday and had it and. You ended up taking my whole colon, although I left enough to poke everything back up. Which was very fortunate. But he thought he got it all, Which, of course, is everybody's first question and.

All right, the IV thing kept going off, I guess, because I quit breathing, which is not unusual when you're on morphine, I guess. But anyway, they would look that thing just ring and ring and ring and ring. It was driving this long. I mean, they wait 15 minutes and it's like car door, you know the Dean, Dean Ding Ding. And I saw every time I would want to sleep. That thing would wake me up. Well. After day of that I was ready to kill something. And. They just wouldn't let it go.

City and found another woman that was interested in marrying him, so he chose to marry her. She had. Three daughters. Of her own, who were just a little older than than than the young girl that the the man had. And when they moved into the house, all was well for a while. But as time went on, it became more and more clear that the stepmother, the new wife, was favoring her own daughters over the gentleman's daughter. And eventually it got so bad that the littlest girl there, the the gentleman's daughter, was really forced to do all the work in the house. And the daughters of the new wife really got to sit around all day. And in fact they made Cinderella sleep in the near the fireplace or in next to the fireplace and she ended up being covered with. Ashes from the fireplace, so they nicknamed her Cinderella to make fun of her. Time went on, and Cinderella's only friends really were the animals in the household. All of them, including the dog and cat and mice and even the rats were her friends. And so time went on and they all grew older and they were in there probably late teens, maybe, when it was clear that Cinderella was a beautiful young woman and the step sisters were not quite so beautiful. Partly because they were mean and nasty. Um, so they lived in a in a Kingdom with a king who lived in the palace in the center of the city. And he had a son and the king wanted his son, the Prince to marry. Well the Prince was had a hard time finding somebody that he really cared about and the other Prince or the king wanted to have him marry someone who was from the Kingdom. So they decided to have. A ball where all the young ladies of the Kingdom would be invited, and he and the Prince would have a chance to meet somebody that he'd like to marry, they hoped. Everybody received an invitation. The stepmother received their invitation and was of course very excited. Cinderella was reading it over her shoulder. She was excited. They, the stepmother told the three-step Sisters. About the ball and they were excited. So, umm. Everybody was running around getting all prepared and finding dresses and finding hairdos and beautiful shoes and. Finally, after all that work, it came down to the day of the ball, and Cinderella had worked pretty hard to try to find something that she herself could wear. But of course she couldn't find much of anything great, and so it looked pretty raggedy. And so the step sisters laughed at her and said you can't go to the ball looking like that.

Ohh, every morning, five days a week until I got so I could do It. Happened again when I went to Korea. It happened again when I went to Guatemala. So and and and Brazil. Where they did not speak English, spoke English and Jamaican, They spoke English in Malaysia at that time, but the. Only time that I've really had what I call a serious communication problem is when I have. Been transported into a place where people don't speak my language and I have to communicate it and I have to communicate immediately and then study at the same time and I find I do it by reading body language, reading facial expressions. A lot of this moving hands and to describe what I want. And then as as the language picks up on my part, I have less effect to do. That's pretty much my experience with that. Were you ever in a situation when you were frightened or scared? Yes. OK, What happened? Tell me the story. Start from the beginning. OK. I was on a boat or ship, I should say. U.S. President of mine was President Wilson and we were sailing from, I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo. And I had my my husband and my 2. Youngsters were there. They were probably 3rd and 4th grade. And we came in. We were about midway in the Pacific Ocean. When the typhoon came up. So. The captain, you know, notified us there's a little weather out there and so we're going to take evasive action. Well, what happened was another typhoon. Started and the two of them met and our little ship was in the vortex. I was frightened. I was my children. One of them was thrown out of her bunk and you know hit her head on a on a on a wash basin and and I we scrapped them in something I can't remember exactly because I was miserable. I was seasick and I was on the. Crown deck and they had storm windows up so could the problem you're supposed to be able to see. But they have these bad weather big thick windows up and I was strapped in a deck chair that was bolted to the deck. And I was sitting in this chair because I could be watching the waves come up over me. And then I would hear crashing and when we would go up real high, the ship would Creek and go free. And then go down. I was probably the most terrified. Anytime I had ever been in my life they had ropes for people. You know if you had to go to the bathroom or something you couldn't walk so you would do this to try and find your way.

But I also spent some time in Mexico and there's people down there that speak no English, so I've. You know, had to. Adapt and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish, enough to get by. Things like. Gustan Cerveza or? Don't they Albano? You know the important stuff, you know. Uh, the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun, Mexico. And. We were at the time we've been discussing this, and we were just standing in line at the movie theater. And it just happened, the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel, which we had planned to go see, you know, to go to the island of Cozumel and you know, travel around there a little bit because there's some ruins there. It's a really nice place. Well, the. Guy. In the group that was telling about their experience down, there apparently was an ex Marine or something. He was just. Perfectly built and. He had. They had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab they gotten. Near the port. I think they were doing one of the Princess Cruises or something. So they had come into port and had been spent the day there and then they had to get back to the ship. So they hired a cab while the cab starts going the other direction. And. He kept telling him no, no, no, no, you're going the wrong way. The ports over here, you know you need to go back this way and. He wouldn't stop.

By the time it came to go, Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to. Make a dress or prepare herself to go. But I'll be honest to her, her animal friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores, using fragments of her step sisters clothes and such that they had cast away because they didn't want it. So Cinderella was very happy. That they had the dress for her and while the. Stepmother and step sisters did not expect her to be able to make it. Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress. Very happy to go. Then the step sisters began to realize that her dress composed of things that they had passed away. And. They started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters. And she went out to the yard and was crying. And then the fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight, and she made her very beautiful. All that. But she wanted her. It would only last till midnight And see how she turned, you know, a pumpkin into a carriage and, you know, transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful. And so Cinderella raced off to the ball. Where she met the Prince and I guess it was love at first sight and they were dancing together and you know he he very much enjoyed his time with her. And they were dancing outside, and she saw the clock, and she noticed it was almost midnight. So she went racing down the stairs, leaving one of her glass slippers behind. And she went racing off the carriage. And she actually didn't make it quite home. And when it struck by night and everything turned back to what it was, pumpkin, the carriage turned back into a pumpkin and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers. And so this Prince. After this happened, he was very interested in finding her. You know, he was born. He wondered why she ran away and so he. Set out to search for her using the glass slip."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL11-1_506812_746277.wav", "azure_transcription": "And finally, the mom called the fire department because she didn't know how to get the dad or the cat out of the tree.

All right. So now tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can. You can use any details from the pictures that you saw or from what you just already knew about it, OK? So when Cinderella was a little girl, her mom passed away and her father remarried another woman who had two daughters. But they were not very kind to Cinderella. The daughters, her step sisters, were very mean to her, as was the stepmother. So as they grew up, they asked the derella to do all the chores around the house, and she didn't get to participate in the same things that her step sisters did. So one day they received an invitation. From the palace. That said, the Prince was having a ball and wanted to invite all of the single women throughout the land to come to the ball because he was looking for a Princess and the step sisters were very excited about it and so was Cinderella. But the stepmother and step sister said, ohh, well, you can't go to the ball because you have nothing to wear. And so Cinderella found a trunk in the attic and made a dress herself with her animal friends that she had made through the years. And it was a beautiful dress. And she was so excited because now she'll be able to go to the ball. And when her step sister saw it, they toured apart because they were so angry that she was able to put something like that together. So Cinderella was distraught and went to her room and cried. And the step sisters went off to the ball and along came Cinderella's fairy godmother. And she said, oh, well, you can go to the ball. And she turned the pumpkin into a carriage and the dogs into horses and the mice into the porters. And Cinderella went into the carriage and went on to the ball. She danced with the Prince and had a wonderful time. But remember that her fairy godmother told her that she must leave by midnight or everything would go back to the way they were. So she.

Like any sane person would do. Yeah, any same person. You see a sleeping girl. No, nothing else works. I mean, you kiss her, you wanted two things are gonna happen. She's either gonna wake up and slap you or one of three things wake up and slap you, wake up and just say, well, what happened, or wake just now, wake up at all. You got three options. Two of them are good. Yeah, the third one, it's a little rough, but no, no worse off than it was before. It doesn't hurt anything. OK, so now I'm gonna have you do the same thing with Little Red Riding Hood, OK?   Sister nice phone.  Alright. Remember, you can use anything that you remember as well as the pictures from the book tell us. Alright, so Laura redheads at her house with her mom and her moms baking some muffins and bread and some snacks too for Little Red Riding Hood taped her granny So she she's out playing with the animals while her mom's doing that. And then she gets the basket from inside and she's like, OK, well I'm, I'm off to grannies. We'll watch. She's going off to her. Grandmother. She gets a little sidetracked and playing with the animals and she runs into this wolf. And almost like, hey, where are you? Where are you going? She's like, well, I'm going over here to my granny's house, Huh. I got a basket full of goodies for. So, like, the wolf goes over and looks in the basket and she's like, hey, leave that alone. That's not for you. And so it looks like it. If I get there first maybe I can get these guys. So the wolf runs on ahead and gets the granny's house and like knocks on the door and granny comes and answers the door and look, it's a wolf. So I mean she she runs off, she's scared. Well looks like I have an idea and say he dressed up and wanna grannies nightgowns and put on a sleeping cap and grab your glasses and crawled into the bed. And. Little Red Riding Hood goes to the door and knocks and the wolf disguises its voices. Like come on in sweetie. And it's a little Red Riding hood's like, ohh OK Granny.

When I graduated from undergraduate school, I went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I'm from Ohio and I had the opportunity to travel as part of the International Foreign Youth Exchange, which is a 4H associated organization. I was big in in 4H when I was young because I grew up in Ohio. So I grew up on a farm and did all that kind of thing. But anyway, I had the opportunity Ohio, the state of Ohio, sense several people every year to go to a foreign country and it's to learn more about that culture and then bring information back and share that with others. And it's a really nice opportunity. We had people stay with us when I was growing up, so I always knew that I wanted to do that and since I had taken French all through high school, I thought I will go to a French speaking country and France. Wasn't available, but Belgium was. So I chose Belgium and luckily I got to go there. I soon found out that learning high school French was not what they were speaking in Belgium, so it took a lot longer to be able to communicate. But it was really interesting in that I kind of experienced what it's like not to be able to communicate very well because the families that I was placed in, I was in several different families while I was there. I was there for six months. Most of them didn't speak any English, so I had to. Learn French and that's the best way to learn it I think. But it it was I when I say it was life changing, it really kind of made me think about first of all that other people are not like us in the United States and really got me thinking about how can I do what I do as a speech pathologist in other countries. So I immediately came home and. Interviewed with the Department of Defense because I wanted to be an international speech pathologist and they said, well, you got to get your masters degree back then you didn't have to have your masters degree and in a lot of settings to work. And so that's when I came to the University of South Carolina to get my masters and met my husband, got married, had children and that kind of thing. But it's always been something. I had a private practice when I was teaching as a full time professor and did some. A lot of international work that way. So I was doing telepractice before, it was cool actually. And I've got to work with people around the country. I did accent modification and and that kind of thing. So still a big interest of mine. I still love to travel. I still keep in touch with my some of my host families in Belgium and we've hosted kids from other countries for for other programs as well. So you know, I think it always encouraged my children. I hope they will get to if not study abroad and travel. A little bit more than I did growing up. It just wasn't a big opportunity until I was like in college when I was able to do it. Now these pictures also tell a story. Take a look at them. Tell me a story with the beginning, middle and end. And again, you can look at these pictures as you're telling your story. So the little boy was playing soccer in his yard and all of a sudden he kicked the ball through his living room window. His dad was in the living room when the ball came through and it knocked over the lamp right over onto his dad. His dad was startled and stood up and looked out the window with a grim look on his face. Take a look at these pictures that tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story also with the beginning, middle and end, and you can look at these pictures as you tell your story.

And the sisters or the sisters, the three sisters did not like this new child, and they commanded her to do all kinds of. Menial work and task and do their laundry and sweep the floors, but she consoled herself in her friendship with animals and be it horses or dogs or even mice. She was very friendly to animals. And So what she didn't what love she didn't get from her sisters or other sisters in the household. She got from the little creatures that surrounded her every day when she was going about her task. Then one day a notice came that the governor of the land was going to hold, hold, hold. A ball. And and the household was invited to the ball. So Cinderella thought that that included her because the whole household was invited, but her sisters told her differently, and furthermore they told her that she was not. Not only not invited, but she was not appropriately dressed or could not, did not have a dress that would suit the occasion. So they left for the ball and Cinderella was very, very sad. But here comes the fairy the. Godmother fairy and says what would you like to do my child? And she says I would like to go to the ball so but I don't have a dress. And the fairy said no problem, we're going to whip up the dress with my magic wand. And Cinderella found herself in this magnificent dress and a very nice pair of shoes, not only that but also a carriage that was going to take her to the ball. So she goes to the ball. And impresses everybody, including the the Prince. The King's son. Who falls desperately in love with her? But the fairy had said you must be back by midnight or you're going to turn into a pumpkin. So Cinderella hurries back. And makes it back before midnight, but leaves behind a shoe. So the Prince knew that the owner of the shoe was the woman that he wanted to marry. But where was she? She would know what to be seeing. So he started a campaign to find the owner of the shoe, and they had to find the person. Boom. The shoe fit perfectly. And they went through the sisters, and even the mother tried her luck, but the shoe would not fit and so no candidate was found to marry the Prince until. One of the animals told the surveyor that she should try it on Cinderella. And when the surveyor did that, the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly. So the Prince had found the woman he wanted to marry from the ball, and they lived happily ever after. I would like you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.

He was hacked, getting a new wife. Who would be Cinderella's stepmother? Her stepmother had two little girls. That were about the same age as Cinderella. The stepmother had a cat and Cinderella had a dog and Cinderella. Thought everything could be good and her dad thought everything would be good. Well, as they grew up the step sisters. Ohh really were not nice to Cinderella. They were. Evil step sisters. They did things like they made her do all the chores, then throw things at her, then make her. Clean the floors. Clean this. Senators out of the fireplace that maker take care of all the animals including their cat and their cat didn't like Cinderella, so that was always not fun because Cinderella had friends that were nice, so that was kind of tough thing to do. Now Cinderella obviously was sad, so every night she would go to her room. And should look out her and go, and she could see in the distance she could see the palace. And she. What did the palace and says Ohh. I wish I could go there someday just to see what it's like. So she. Just would go to bed at night and dream of it. Well, meanwhile, at the palace, the king. And his right hand man. Would go through. And try to figure out what else what was needed because the king was getting old and he would need to step down soon. Well. He had a son who was a Prince, but the Prince did not have a wife, and he wanted the Prince to have a wife before. He would give him the Kingdom. So. They decided they would have a grand ball. And invite the eligible young women from around the. The village and they sent out invitations to everybody and. The stepmother. Got the invitation and was reading it and Cinderella read it over her back, over her shoulder. And Cinderella, Well, I'm a girl in the village. I get to go. And her stepmother didn't say anything, but her step sisters were no way. You can't go. Got to have a got to have a ball gown, so she did her ball gown. She didn't have a ball gown, that is. So she went to her room and she got out a book that had pictures of. Ohm. Ball gowns that she could have. And she talked to her friends, the mice, and they took a dress that she had and they put bows and frills on it and things like that and made it a pretty dress for her. So she thought, well, I've got what I need. I can go now. They can't say I don't have a ball gown. So she went downstairs. Where her mother and step sisters were getting ready to leave. And when they saw her dress, they were upset and one of the step sisters. Ripped her dress and one of them ripped her necklace off of her. And of course, the stepmother didn't do anything about it. Cinderella was upset."}, {"segment_name": "richardson21_1668821_1908210.wav", "azure_transcription": "And no, it thinks to herself, Yep, I am in a good situation here. This is not sketchy at all. And she takes a bite of the apple. She doesn't even swallow it. She just takes a bite. And then she collapses, and the apple rolls dramatically out of her hand with a single bite taken out of it. And honestly, I'm going to be real. The first bite that I ever take of an apple is never that perfect. Like, I can only like get a wedge out and then from there I can take proper bites. But apparently Snow White has awesome jaw strength as well as in human beauty. So anyway, she collapses. The apple rolls out of her hand. The crown cackles maniacally, as you are want to do, and runs out. And then? I mean, I assume she like hobbles out because she's still a Crone. Maybe she should know she doesn't turn herself back into the queen. She should have turned herself back into the queen because she could have made a better getaway. But anyway, the old crown hobbles away. And all the dwarves come high, howling home. And they see Snow White passed out on the floor and they're like again. But then they realize that she's not breathing too well or at all. And so. They. Get on the backs of deer. I think like they ride deer. To go find out who did this. I don't know how the deer are tracking this Crone. Presumably she just leaves a really obvious trail, but they follow her. And. I don't know there's a there's a lightning storm or something, I think. And. The crown is being chased by all of these really antagonistic deer. Deer can be really antagonistic. I have a friend who says that they're targeting her and like, they'll go out of their way to jump in front of her car specifically, and I believe that. I've seen it happen. It's terrifying ohh but anyway antagonistic deer with. Tiny bearded men riding them. And so she's understandably freaked out and she climbs up onto this mountain and she's trying to hang on to the edge because she's about to fall. And then lightning strikes the stick she's holding on to. And the ground beneath her feet crumbles and she falls, presumably to her death, but probably not for sure, in case they wanted to do a sequel. I don't know if that was more of a modern development. They did that in Rapunzel and and Tangled. Mother God is probably dead. Hope she's dead. She was scary. So the Evil Queen as the crown falls to her death. And all the dorks were like, well, that was strangely unsatisfying. We better go check on Snow White and so they race back to Snow White, but she is still dead. And so they put her in this beautiful glass coffin, which doesn't seem very practical again. But this movie doesn't seem to be very much about practicality. And they put her in this glass coffin and they're mourning her and their flowers and tears and furry wildebeests crying and. Suddenly the Prince from before rides up on his beautiful stallion and he says what the heck, The pretty girl from before is super dead. I'm going to kiss her because that is the logical next step. So then he proceeds to lay one on her. And she wakes up. I assume she, like, just Hawks out the bite of apple. Maybe he went for some tongue and he found the apple. And took it out of her mouth and that was censored. That seems logical. Because if he's gonna kiss a dead person, he might as well go all the way. Good to go home. Yeah, that's what happened. And so she sits up. And thank goodness the lid of the coffin had been lifted for him to kiss her, cause otherwise she would have hit her head on it and probably knocked herself unconscious again. Because she does that a lot."}, {"segment_name": "wright89a_571113_810501.wav", "azure_transcription": "Once Upon a time there is a little girl named Cinderella and she lived with her dad. Her mom had died years ago, so it was just her herself and her dad. And then one day, her dad remarried and brought the new mom with two step sisters home to meet Cinderella. And Cinderella was so happy to get a new mom because she missed her mom. Well. Cinderella and her dad really loved each other and. They were a family again, with a new mom and and two step sisters. But then Cinderella's dad died and the step mom was not a very nice mom and the step sisters were not very nice to Cinderella. And so they made Cinderella do all the chores. They made her do the dishes and scrub the floor and make the beds and make the food. And they would not let Cinderella be part of the family. And they made Cinderella sleep upstairs in the attic. And so all her, all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there. And she would look out her window and she could see far beyond the city, the castle, and she. Would sit and watch and wonder, oh, what a beautiful place that she maybe someday would want to go and see. Well, meanwhile there was the Prince, and the Prince wasn't married yet, and the prince's father wanted him to get married because he was going to someday inherit the Kingdom. And so they decided to make up do a ball, which is a big dance. And they're gonna make this beautiful dance and invite all the single girls in that town come to the ball. And so the Prince could pick one of the sisters or one of the single girls to be his wife. And so they sent out invitations and every home got an invitation for this big dance and everybody was invited. And so the stepmother and the two step sisters. They were so excited to go to this dance and they were going to dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go. And so Cinderella said, well, can I go? I'm part of the family too and the stepmother said, Cinderella, nobody wants you. You're shabby and you don't have any clothes to wear. And stepmother said, if you do all your chores you can go and ohh Cinderella, I was so excited that she was able to go to the ball. And so she would have been told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball. And so they made her a dress and it oh, it looks so pretty. So the night of the ball. Cinderella, stepmother and step sisters got dressed to go to the ball and they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry in their hair. Done. And here comes Cinderella and she comes down the stairs and she goes, ohh, wait for me, I can go too. And the step sisters and the step mom looked at her and they were appalled. They could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear and they were very jealous. And so they ripped the clothes off of her and they go, Cinderella, you can't go look at you. You look like. You look like a little merchant. And no Prince would ever want to look at you. And so they said they were off to the bar."}, {"segment_name": "richardson22_537900_777280.wav", "azure_transcription": "OK, so so the story of Cinderella is that her mom. Died and her dad remarried this really, really mean woman who had these really, really terrible daughters. And so they all moved in together and. I'm assuming that her father had a little bit of money or this old man woman wouldn't be marrying him, but when she moves into the house I hope that dad leaves because she is really really meet Cinderella so. Cinderella is May. She's made two. Clean the floors and do all the stuff that nobody wants to do and so she's pretty much slave again. I don't know where the dad is during all this, but so she works for a long time because in the story it showed her as a little girl and then later on it's like 8 years later. So apparently this happened for a long time. This girl is going to need some help so she. Is still working for the family and then she, I don't know, has a lot of animal friends and such and she looks out the window all the time. And then there's that castle and she's like ohh, there's where other people live who I'm sure have a great life, so. Then there is a ball or some sort of dance or something like that for the Prince so he can find a wife. I don't know this sounds. Very crazy, as I'm saying it, but it's true. So they have this dance so that Prince could find a wife and they invite everybody in the Kingdom. And apparently again, her family is pretty well off because they didn't invite the servants. But her family gets invited, but the stepmother doesn't let her come. But she thinks she's going to come. So she gets the trial on the outfits and stuff and sing songs probably in the movie and birds and things like that help her get ready. And then. The step sisters are like, you aren't going. And in the book they take her necklace and terror dress and all this other stuff. I just think that's a little bit over the top. But they do and they're really mean. And so she has to stay home. Well, I guess she probably cries or something happens that causes the fairy godmother to come out. I don't know if she rubs the lamp in there. It's maybe she read a book. I don't. I don't remember that part. But anyway, she has this fairy godmother, which I wonder where she's been all these other years, so. She asked her fairy godmother, I guess to go to the dance I would probably just ask to move somewhere else. Like this is pretty crappy situation. I don't think that like one night is going to help. But anyway, so she wants to go to the dance. So very godmother, like gets all her stuff, gets her all gussied up and then puts her in a pumpkin, sends her way. So she gets to go to the dance and it looks like she had a nose job. If you'll look in the book, her nose is much much smaller in her hair, is much, much blonder when she goes to the dates. So something happens and she gets. Dressed up and she goes to the dance and the lo and behold the Prince falls in love with her and so then she knows she has to be back by midnight because that's when her terrible sisters I guess are getting home and the pumpkins and all the things that are happening. So anyway, she runs away and she runs her shoes off, which the glass shoes anyway. I would say that that has not been comfortable. I probably had taken them off 15 minutes after getting there so she lost her shoe and then all the Prince knows is that girl he loves wore this shoe. So um. He sends his lackey guy out to all the people that he invited to the party to figure out who fit in this shoe and. It's hard to believe that nobody else's foot would fit in this."}, {"segment_name": "wright82a_28630_267990.wav", "azure_transcription": "OK. It's the little girl's cat.

And I'd like the story to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Well, it looks to me like this little girl's. Cat climbed up a tree and got stuck there or just wanted to hang out there and I would say the next thing that happened was dad tried to get up the tree to rescue the cat and by the looks of his face he looks stuck as well. The dog doesn't seem any pleasing to please that he's up the tree. And it looks like someone had to call the fire department to get the ladder to get the cat and dad down. So what I have for you first is I have pictures from the Disney storybook version of Cinderella that we're going to go through, just to let you kind of refresh your memory about this version. Afterwards, I'll take the pictures away and you can tell me the story of Cinderella as you know it. It does not have to be this Disney version. The pictures are just here to help kind of jog your memory about a few things. So we'll go through the pictures first you and just let me know when you are ready to see the next picture and we'll move on. OK. OK. OK. Forgot about those guys, OK? OK. OK. OK. OK. Alrighty. OK. OK. OK. And they lived happily ever after. And there's my little guts. My little Gus. Gus. You know the names. I love it. Would you like to see any of those pictures again? I don't think so. OK, and then let me stop sharing. Give it back over to you. OK, so at this time, I'd like you to tell me as much as you remember about the story of Cinderella, using any details that you already knew. You have stepmother with her two girls and then Cinderella and her father. I guess something happened to him. That one I don't remember. But Cinderella winds up in the family of the stepmother with the two other sisters. Um, those sisters are jealous of her and. Yeah, let's see. Incomes Cinderella spends a lot of time by herself."}, {"segment_name": "UNH1043_1247277_1486602.wav", "azure_transcription": "The game is baseball. The object is for one of two teams to score more points than the other, and points in this sport are called runs. Umm. The way that the that the playing field is set up is there's a diamond and there's four bases at each point of the diamond the the the diamond is on one point and such that the the the bottom point is called home plate and then going counterclockwise around the clock there's first base, second base, third base, and then back to home plate. The team that is in the field and is on defense, they're allowed to have gloves and there's a ball that that that is in play. The other team that is trying to score the runs at that point is has a bat and they have some protective equipment including helmets and such. The way that the the the game starts is one team is on defense, so they take the field and there's certain positions for each player. There's nine active players per side, so the defensive team has nine players out in the field. The offensive team has one bat player that starts at home plate and he's called the batter. The team that is in the field first is the visiting team to the to the stadium. The home team I take it back. The visiting team backs first. The home team is on the field first. The way that the game is set up there are nine what are called innings and an inning consists of where each team gets to bat once. So if we start the game with the home team in the field and the visitor team batting, umm the the visiting team bats until they get what are called 3 outs and then they switch sides where the the home team then comes to bat and the visiting team. Then is in the field. And then they get 3 outs. Once both teams have their three outs, that is 1 inning and you do nine of those sets. In the defensive position, there's, you know, there's several different positions. There's nine positions. One of them in the center of the diamond is called the pitcher. And then at home plate is the catcher. And then we go around, we go have a first baseman, second baseman, the third baseman. There's someone that stands between third and second base called a short stop. And then beyond the diamond is a is a field behind the diamond where three other players hang out and and their goal. The defensive goal is to you. There's two ways you can make an out. You can catch the ball in the in the fly. Actually three ways can count. Now catch the ball on the fly if the if the batter hits the ball and the pitcher throws the ball towards home plate, the batter hits it. If the batter hits the ball and someone in the field catches it before it hits the ground, that is one out. There's something called balls and strikes, where if the batter misses with his bat and the pitch is in a certain location relative to the person's body and the and the actual physical base at home plate, that's called a strike. It's outside that lateral movement. It's called the ball. You get 3 strikes and your or your the batter is out. Or if you get 4 balls in, the batter gets a free trip to first base. So if the batter hits the ball and it hits the ground and someone catches it after it hits the ground and is able to throw it to the first baseman before the batter gets to first base, then that batter is out if the batter makes it to first base before. The throw gets there, he gets to, he is safe on first base."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto42a_612000_851310.wav", "azure_transcription": "Cinderella's dad. Got remarried and.

Those were two injury stories. Was important. And soon as I hang up from you, I'll go. Why didn't I tell her that this is what is important? Well, you know, I think one of the most recent things. Is my daughter's gallbladder because I haven't had too many injuries or like like stopping moments as I have when that hit last January and she had called me. Not feeling well, Not feeling well, Not feeling well. She was back and forth at IU Health. That went on for a period of. I don't know four or five days or so and. Ohh, my goodness, the chain of events. I do remember that. I'm not sure who was going to bring her. I called her on a Friday after I got off of work. She had quarantined herself down in her basement because she was afraid of giving what she thought was the flu to. I guess Jackie was still there at that point. And Mark and. When I called her, she was. Low speaking and what I would consider lethargic. So I told her I needed her to listen to me and I needed her to. Call Mark and tell him that she needed to go to the ER, that she was dehydrated and she needed to get intravenous. Then she said somebody called her and offered to bring her bone broth. If that didn't make her feel better. Well, she did get the bone broth and it did not. And Mark did take her to the ER. They did release her. It wasn't long after that IU then found stuff that. Said something was going on with the gallbladder. She called me crying. And then there's nothing like the helpless feeling of a parent when they know you know that they need you.

It was Jackie because Jackie drove her to the airport and picked me up the next day and we were in the doctor's office altogether.

And this year it was going to be in San Francisco and. It'll be 20 years ago next month and my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a lot of the background work. And my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week. And so Don stayed here and my sister from Dallas flew in. And that was the week that they had the San Francisco earthquake. And so we were at Fisherman's Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free. And we were waiting to go. On the trolley car, back to Saint Francis, the Western Saint Francis. And as we're waiting in line, the earthquake hit and. It's really funny because we've never been in anything like that. And so my sister, just being the big sister, she always tried to calm me down and she said that was probably a two or three. And how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake, so we didn't know. But that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing. Well, the electricity was off, so nothing worked. And so we walked. 18 blocks back to our hotel. And in San Francisco, you know, it's pretty hilly. And so. I mean it was, it was a quite a jaunt back there and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel, so we sat outside this big park area. For a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in. And the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there and we wanted to also call her two husbands. And so by the time we got back into the hotel, we quickly called mother, who never watches news. She doesn't like to hear the bad news, and there's hardly any good news that's told, so we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know. But my sister said, mother, what are you doing? And she said, well, I'm watching the news because. So and so told me that there was a big earthquake in San Francisco. So this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco.

So there were very few options for me except to just have the baby. And I did. And I just remember her coming out and looking like this little monchy chi, which is a toy from when I was younger. And she was so brown, her hair was so brown and she had this brown hair. All over and I have light hair and her dad has light hair. So it was just pretty incredible to see this, this little baby with all this brown hair. Umm. Anyways, it's just that kind of thing that you just don't. It doesn't go away. I remember what I was wearing when I got there. I I remember where I was sitting in the car. I remember the stoplights we went through. I remember the path to the hospital.

I was nervous to have because it was so traumatic for me to have Grace because she, like I said, came so fast and when I got to the hospital, there was nothing to do except to have this baby. And so when I was pregnant with Leo, I just remember. My gynecologist, like, you know, you had a very quick first born. This is going to happen again. And. I sat, I was dilated at maybe three or four for like weeks and all I could think was when is this going to happen? When is that terrible, horrible pain going to come back? And that's not how it worked at all, actually. I I. He was also born on his due date. So now we've determined it's me who has to have things in the right place. But we wrote to the hospital. I checked myself in, it was so calm. It was the exact opposite and. He came out with this white hair, this golden kind of face and I just remember thinking, you know, there are so many times when people say you know, no two kids are alike or boy, girl, two boys, 2 girls, doesn't matter, like they were completely different. They are still completely different, but they are the best things I have. Like I look at my life and. That's it. It's them. So that's my most, I guess my most important story in two parts.

But she had to go back to all her work. More cooking, more cleaning. But she was such a nice and gentle person that all the animals loved her and flocked to her.

Cinderella's house got an invitation too, and everybody was so excited, both stepsisters thought it would just for sure be her that the Prince would choose. So they used Cinderella to help him get ready to get their dresses, get everything ready. And Cinderella wanted to go too, but she didn't have time to get herself ready. But she so the animals got ready for her. They made her address. And did her hair and got her all ready to go. And she ran downstairs to go to the ball, but her stepmother wouldn't let her go. She said that only girls, only the step sisters could go and she rips Cinderella's dress. Senator Roller was so upset she went back to her room and she cried and she cried. And we'll lo and behold.

And off she went to the ball in the brand new dress at the fairy Godmother had made by magic for her. Especially important, which She was wearing beautiful glass slippers on her feet. So she went to the ball, and the minute she entered the ball, the Prince had eyes for no one but Cinderella. And they danced, and they danced and they danced, and they had a wonderful time. But then the clock struck midnight, and the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that the magic would only last until midnight. So the clock started striking midnight, and Cinderella had to run before the Prince saw that she wasn't really a Princess, but she was just a poor Cinderella. She ran down the stairs. For carriage and hunting just in time before the magic went away, but she dropped one of her glass slippers behind on her run. So she went home, and the Prince was sad that he knew he had her glass slipper. So he decided to search the countryside, for whosoever foot would fit the glass slipper and whoever fit it would become his bride. And they went around and no one's foot would fit the glass slipper until they got to Cinderella's house. Both step sisters tried, but their feet wouldn't fit. Finally, they tried it on Cinderella and her foot fit perfectly. And she and the Prince got married and lived happily ever after the end and I keep talking.

We have a licensed speech therapist that comes in once a week and teaches a lesson, and then we follow up on whatever she wants us to do the rest of the week. So our language kids, we really work hard with them on questions, Pronouns, you know, adjectives.

Just make sure if it's the same story, you tell it as if I've never heard, I'm going to tell you a different story, OK? When about 1999, I took my kids sledding up in Troy, OH, which is just north of here.

You never know if you say I think it's going to rain today, if that will make her cry or not so. What I have found with her. Whereas we have always. She doesn't live in my same time town, so we always communicate via phone and we could talk for half an hour about nothing or anything and without physically seeing her face. I have to. Like start the conversation slow and see where she's at and her dopamine levels to know if she's at a good point to communicate about sensitive issues or if this conversation will just be about nothing, you know? So I've had to do a lot more listening to her and listening to the queues versus. Normally when I call her, whoever instigates the call, it's more like, Oh my gosh, this happened today and you just start rambling. But I really can't do that anymore because if I say something about the kids that are driving me crazy that I just need to let out to somebody, it will really upset her now. So she takes it all to heart, so. For me, I just, I've really had to kind of let go of. Part of our relationship because. I don't tell her as much because I never know if it's going to upset her or not and it's sad, but so getting back to that, I guess it's all about listening and especially when you can't see somebody because she doesn't do FaceTime or anything, which to me that would be a clear indication I can read her face a lot better, but so asking the right questions and just listening a lot more. I'd like you to think about. Something important that happened in your life and I would like you to tell me a story about this event. It can be happy or sad from childhood up to now.

OK, I will say probably the most profound thing that has ever happened in my life was when I gave birth to my first daughter, Katie. I'm the type of person, like I said, I've been very healthy, so I really don't go to the doctors. I don't like to go to doctors and that's kind of how I took that whole pregnancy. I just, I didn't read a lot about it. I just went through it because. I mean, I was fine the whole way. And then when we got to the hospital, I didn't. I had to be induced. So, I mean, I didn't read anything about being induced. I didn't really know know what I was signing up for. But when we walked into that hospital, I mean, I got panic because I didn't know anything. And my mom was there. She came up and she saw my doctor. And I remember the first thing she said, she goes. Your doctor says, old as you are, and she was. She was only like a couple years older than me. But I really didn't think anything about it, about it. And then I started getting nervous.

I think maybe what she should have done is channel her anger productively by finding out what else the Magic mirror can do, because that seems like a very narrow minded. And not particularly useful use of such a magic mirror. Anyway, she's insecure. We've discussed this. So at this point the Queen says to herself, Well, I guess I can't do anything. Gonna have to kill her. And so while Snow White is out in the courtyard singing into a well so that she can hear her voice echo back at her because she's so Dang lonely and she's literally been around nobody but herself her entire life.

But basically, one day she meets this guy who shows up and joins in on her duet. She's kind of creepy. He comes out of nowhere. So she's like singing to herself. I'm wishing, I'm wishing for the one I love. Today. And then Creepy Prince comes in and goes today out of nowhere, and it's terrifying. And so that's how they meet. But then she runs away because she's never met anybody in her whole life and she's terrified, rightly. And so the Prince goes away, and she goes back to her lonely life. And this is the point at which the Queen is like, well, clearly I need to kill her if this is the most logical next step. And so she goes up to this Huntsman. And, says Huntsman, you're going to kill Snow White. You're going to bring me her heart as proof. I mean, he could bring her anybody's heart and it would look like Snow White. It's not like Snow White has a sown on label that says property of Snow White on her heart. But that's not the point. The Queen is clearly a little bit few fries short of a Happy Meal. So the Huntsman goes out and he chases Snow White a little bit through the woods, and then he just realizes that she's so kind and pure he could never kill her. And so he falls to his knees and supplication, and he says I'm so sorry, and he drops the knife and so it's like. And then he says run away and I will cover for you. But you better run away and never come back because the queen is going to kill you. And so if my memory serves me, the Huntsman kills a boar or something, a wild boar in the forest. And he brings the heart of a wild boar to the queen and says, look queen, this is Snow White's heart. Part of a wild pork doesn't look like a human heart. The queen is stupid, basically, and the queen says, ohh yes, cook that into a meal for me and then she proceeds to eat this bohart, thinking that it's snow whites. Which is weird. This is not a movie I would show my kids I don't know about you. Umm. So Snow White has fled into the forest. There are creepy trees that are grabbing for her and she's making weird faces again. And eventually she makes it to this cottage where she breaks in. Breaking and entering also a common theme in these stories. She breaks in and she sees.

So it didn't take very long and I got the chicken pox and I remember feeling really weak and lethargic and I would be just on the floor. We had a room that was like a a little family room that just had a teeny tiny TV in it, and I just slept on the floor and I wasn't experiencing any, any pain or terrible itching yet, but that. Did come and I remember feeling my mom would create this like mixture of some kind of paste that she would put on my the, you know, on the the chicken pox. And I think that it was like I want to say like baking soda and water. It was some combination of something like that. And it was probably because you were supposed to use something that you had to buy at the store and she probably. Was not going to do that because in order to save money, but it worked. I I do remember that and and I remember she would put me in the bath with that oatmeal kind of mixture and it was very soothing and then after the bath would put this again, this paste or this mixture on the different spots. But even though those things helped me. Physically feel better. The thing that I I remember about when I started to feel. Better, like really feel better is. It was a big time where kids loved scratch and sniff stickers, and we had sticker books and she brought me a sticker book with a bunch of different scratch and sniff stickers, and I focused on my sticker book instead of the chicken pox. And I think that that's how she got me to forget about the, you know, the kind of itching and scratching and it put me in a better mood, so it wasn't as lethargic. Umm. And you know, I got better.

So the sisters go to the ball and and poor Cinderella is home with her mice and and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe. So the fairy godmother creates the.

Moving up to the thing, my finger went underneath the needle and you know it does that, and I yanked it. So the needle was coming through my fingernail and out the other side. And the teacher took me to the principal's office where he pulled out a pair of pliers from his desk drawer and he said he was going to pull it out and I would not let him. I told him to call my mom. So she came and took me to the hospital and they had to remove. My fingernail and slice my finger open, take out the needle and then X-ray because they had little splinters of metal in there. X-ray that and then sew it back up and I had a huge Band-Aid and unfortunately like 2 days later it was the little middle school dance and I was embarrassed because I had a new dress and I had this great big old bandage what helped me get over it. But I think it was just time. Just time. I have more injuries here. Thank you so much. One more for the road though, that was great. Thank you so much for sharing and ohh my goodness. I do not sew.

And we keep that pretty broad. It can be any kinds of difficulty communicating, but is there someone that comes to mind? OK, great. So in that case, I'd like to know kind of what the issues were with the communication and what you did to what you did about it, if anything. OK. I was special needs teacher for 10 years and still go. So does Becca for that matter still go to Eagle Eyrie once a year with them and there are usually 7 to 8 that go and we chaperone and they have classes but three of them are brothers of which only one can speak. The others you have to follow their. Uh, hand communication. It's not that they sign language, but they try to cause. It's more in the grunting aspect of. Interesting enough, usually her his mom knows what he's referring to. So I would say.

The ball sails quite a ways. In fact, it sails so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room. When it comes through the glass after breaking the window, it even knocks over a lamp in the living room.

There once was a young girl called Cinderella. She hit three ugly step sisters. And her family. Didn't like her very much and made her do all the household chores. She had to scrub and she had to clean and she had to cook and saw and everything all by herself. While her step sisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun. Umm. One day the Prince was going to have a big ball. And all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear, looking around, buying dress, new dresses, checking out how they looked. But Cinderella couldn't go. When all of a sudden her fairy godmother appears and says what's wrong, Cinderella, why are you so depressed? Cinderella says I can't go to the ball that the Prince is having, but my step sisters get to go instead. And a fairy godmother says, well, nonsense. And she waves her magic wand and beautiful gown appears. And she says, well, you're going to need a horse or horses and a coach to ride. So she snatches up some mice that we're playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage. And she gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball. But the stepmother said of the fairy Godmother says be sure you're home by midnight. The magic's only good for one day at the stroke of midnight. All of this will disappear. So Cinderella goes to the ball and she has a wonderful time. She's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the Prince. He just wants to dance with her all night when she all of a sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's 5 minutes to midnight. Ohh goodness. So she turns and races out of the ball and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers, falls off of her foot. Hops into her carriage and as they race away, but right at the stroke of midnight. The horses change back into mice. The carriage changes back into a pumpkin and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen. She sneaks into the house.

I guess a lot of important things sort of happened, you know? Would be hard to. I think, I think. In a sense, I made my own important things, for instance. I grew up in a family. I was one of five children. And now I don't want this to sound, you know? Politically incorrect. My father was a Italian, of Italian descent, and he had this mindset that girls just don't go to college. And unfortunately, four of us were girls, so he didn't. That wasn't. He wasn't pleased with that either, right? And I was the third one. Can you imagine In a row? No boys yet. So anyhow, it was made very clear that college was not on the map. And his his. His idea was that I've been supporting you all these years and now you owe me. You know, you have to go to work and contribute to the household, so this was a built-in thing at the time. I wasn't realizing how grave it was. In fact, it was something that felt almost exciting about it. But I'll be going to work soon. And the good news was that I was also an honor student, and I got to high school at 12. And the bad news was at 16, my education was complete. And now I was going to work. So my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal, I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student, she actually wanted to call him. And I was very calm about the whole thing. I said there's really no point. You know, it's you're not going to get anywhere. This is the state of thing. It's the state-of-the-art the tamiko has sold and that's that. So anyway, she then decided to take me under her wing and. Knew someone down on Wall Street. And who worked in a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust Company, which no longer exists. And they took great pride in that, that company, that they they were at one Wall Street and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street. And this was verbalized. So anyway, she called her friend and I'll never forget her name was Mary Unruh, who I went to say. So I put a suit on. Went shopping and bought myself, you know, very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview and I think I was a shoe in because her friend, the guidance counselor had called her and so she hired me. And I ended up. In a sub basement. Not just a basement, it was a sub basement. I think I was lower than the vaults. In a secretarial pool? Where else? I could be a genius. When I was going to a secretarial pool, I did, and good, good on me. I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to even though I had an academic course of study, I combined it with a commercial course of study and I and I I took typing and stenography. I thought this might help me, and maybe my job won't be so random.

Goes and cleanse it out again, which she said. I don't like doing this twice, It's so soon, but I feel like I should. Well, the 11th day I was at work and they called me and they told me that. He told me that he was shaking the bed. He was jerking so. Well, he should get him to the hospital. I called the doctor and he said give me to the hospital and the bacteria.

I was supposed to go to the hospital every day every time to get the, the, the.

So we go over there and while we were in this office there was this. Cabinet there, they had tape, silk tape in it and it was wide and so I asked the nurse I said where do you get that wide tape?

But he said I did much better job than they did the hospital. It didn't hurt him. So I thought, well, I'm going to do it again then. So I got those sterilized pins and learned how to go through. Through them. To keep it from falling down into his lung cavity and that way yeah, I managed to finally get him to where he was gaining weight back. He bought 200 and some pounds and and then he went down to 126.

Say it again. Now we have them all dried off in. Carl goes into the room with the stereo and he starts playing. Turns it on. Juices some music and he starts dancing. So Carl is dancing in the middle of the rub on his hind legs and the little boy is just thrilled. He seizes that. He just giggles and laughs and he can't quite dance yet, but he really loves to watch the dog dance. Ohh, we've gone to the kitchen.

Again, this can be the same example you chose last week, or it can be a different one. I have to think of this a little bit. I would say I'm going to change stories on you this week. I've got a good friend, his name is Jorge, He's Mexican. And he and I worked together at a company called Net Solve. And what we did was it was remote diagnostics of routers, trouble, network trouble. And Jorge was great that he could talk to us Spanish speaking customers wonderfully, but when it would come over to an English speaking customer, he definitely had problem. He didn't have terrible problems, but it was hard trying to get him to recognize that he wasn't saying things right. And it was hard getting him to understand what I was saying sometimes. So we got to the point where. I joked with him about some of the ways he would say things, like he would have a piece of paper. Instead of a piece of paper. And then? It was, it was just Jorge, you sound like this, and he was totally shocked because he didn't know he sounded like that. And he says, JB, you are the first person that's ever told me that. I'm saying that stuff wrong. So that felt good that I was able to help him and I was able to learn about his communications because he helped me. Yeah, I had high school Spanish, that's been a few years ago, but he. Helped me understand some phrases and in fact. He actually helped my daughter. With her. She went on a. What do you call it? It's not. And then immersion in Mexico. And when she came back? We had Jorge and his wife over for dinner and they talked Spanish the whole time, so.

But my surgery was scheduled at like 11:30 in the morning but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight. So by the time I got in there. I was like a little bit dehydrated so they couldn't find a vein and they had to stick me like 6 times in order to get the IV in and that was very, very unpleasant. They finally got it in, took me into the little. Hospital room and our remember that they were playing Pink Floyd. They had the wall on for the music. I was like, ohh, that's going to be great. You're gonna give me drugs and I'm listening to Pink Floyd, so this is going to be a good day. So did that lay down on the Gurney? They gave me the IV And then the next thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery and my throat hurt. It was painful. I felt I wanted to cry. In fact, I did cry just because it was so unpleasant and it hurts so bad. They were trying to give me like some water to help kind of soothe out my throat and I couldn't swallow it, so it was coming back out of my nose. It was just, it was a mess. It was horrible. But the whole thing probably took like 15 minutes for them to go in there and take it out. But it was like 12 hours of torture for that. And that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out. So I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed, just trying to to feel better. The only thing I could eat were popsicles. You know, people like, oh, you always get ice cream, you get ice cream. But I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't have ice cream, so that made it that much worse. I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt. It was burning my throat. And it was probably. It was probably 3 weeks before I felt really good again after that.

It was a man who had lost his wife but had a young daughter, a sweet young girl. Sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella. He decided it was time that he got. Took away for himself and got a mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman. As she was growing up, she needed a mother, and so he married. A widow. A lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters. The woman who is Cinderella's stepmother. Came into the household and decided that Cinderella. Was just not going to. With her, and she banished her. To the kitchen to do lots of chores, lots of jobs and her told her own 2 little girls ohh really nasty little brats. Got to sit around. Get lots of new clothes and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked. But she had her little cat who she loved, and the cat kept her company and helped as much as she could. And this went on.

And then the fire department shows up, which they're good like that. They've got the ladder and all is well. OK, I'm going to ask you to tell a story now. Have you ever heard the story of Cinderella? I have been. Not in years. OK, well, I might be a little foggy on some of the details. Oh, oh, OK. You can umbrella the book, OK, take a look at all the pictures in the book and afterwards I'll put the book away and then ask you to tell me the story in your own words.     OK, I still am fuzzy on a lot of those details.

OK, so Cinderella is sent to live with this with the family and she is basically a a maid and they there are the 2 steps as the two. I think it's the wicked step sisters. If I recall they were they were rather homely. Cinderella, of course, is very pretty and she's very, you know, sweet and helpful. And these two are kind of spoiled and, you know, not very pleasant. And there's going to be a a ball and I I believe invitations go out and the two sisters are going to. They're gonna go to the ball and Cinderella is not invited and somehow the fairy godmother steps in and Cinderella ends up with, well, it's all magical, you know, right? The pumpkin that turns into a beautiful coach and. By dint of, you know, luck and good favor from the fairy godmother, Cinderella does go to the ball. I believe the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight, so she's dancing with the Prince, having a wonderful time.

Because I'm, I hope the other person in the room is in an audiologist, but it is what it is. So he, he went for the ENT, said him to the audiologist, and the audiologist was in this little glass room with, you know, stuffed animals that moved in symbols and drums and the whole hearing test. So Ryan sat in my lap and we faced her like this. And she proceeded to give him the test. Which he proceeded to pass because. Before she moved the drums, she he was so smart. She looked at the drums and then she looked at him, and then she moved the drums. And then before she moved the monkey with the symbol, she looked at the monkey with the symbol and she looked at him. So she gave him one visual clue after another. So anyway. The ENT and I get into it. In a big, loud way because I he he told me that there was something cognitive going on with Ryan. I told him his audiologist was an idiot and she shouldn't be doing these tests. Anyway, we go through so finally, finally he gets tubes in his ears. As soon as he has the tubes he starts with a Speech Language Pathologist. He was 2.8 I think, at that time That fall. I'll never forget the first session. Madison. I was like, this is never going to work. She was a lovely woman. She was probably early 30s. She looked like Cinderella. Blonde hair, blue eyes. I had never heard anybody enunciate every single word in my life the way she did. Anyway, Susan Rose was a wonderful person. She worked him. To the verge of tears every sessions. We were private pay. She worked him for those 45 minutes. He was only 2.8. He hated going. She didn't let him manipulate. The session and she worked wonders and we ate, drank and slept. Letters and sounds that sheep in the Jeep book. Alphabet cereal, Alphabet pasta. It was like crazy town. So we did that with private pay with her. And then at three years old the town would pick him up. So I thought it was a small town. We should at least have him have connections with that SLP just in case with funding. And Susan Rose said he has met whatever markers you guys use. I can't would be not ready for me to take your money anymore. He was initially, when she met him consultation he was diagnosed with severe phonological disorder which I nearly proceeded to throw up at that point. And then when she, you know, when she dismissed him, you're good. He's all good to go. I was real paranoid. And she's the only thing is 50% of the children with this. Um diagnosis. The the way they're taught traditionally taught how to read in public schools. They're not able to learn how to read that way. So you may at that point you know half though I don't know what go to private school, get another. I didn't know what we were going to do, Madison, but I was like, so anyway, we definitely rolled over to three. He met a nice young SLP. Who had just graduated Madison. She was lovely. So sweet. He manipulated her. He ruled the sessions. It was game on every time we went in there. She was so sweet. She had no idea what he was doing. We would leave. He would look at me and smile.

And I had to the to the clinic, which was close to my house. And I lived in Japan at the time. And so I went in and it was like by this point in my pregnancy, I was going to the clinic quite often. And it was quite a routine. You'd have to come in, pee in a cup, go get your blood pressure taken. Then you'd have like about two minutes to talk to the doctor and and talk really fast and write everything down that he says. And then you'd have to wait an hour to get in there well that day. I came in, went to pee in the cup and then went to go to take my blood pressure and I'd have to sit at this machine. And it takes your blood pressure and prints it out. And then you go hand it to a nurse. So I did. I went put it in there, print it out. I handed it to the nurse.

So they're like, so irritated with me by this point, like, what's your problem? Why don't you know how to do this? And then they take me in, and then the nurse, who's the professional, right, does it and realizes, holy crap, this woman's got, like, really high blood pressure. And then instead of waiting the usual hour just to see the doctor, I got swept in right away. And they said. We're checking you in right now. And so because this is very serious and they checked and they had like, I don't know what is it like sugar or something in my urine and my yeah, so there's all kinds of problems happening with me, unbeknownst to me. And so then they send me upstairs in the clinic and put me on a really strict diet. And after a couple of days, my blood pressure went down. But then they said, well, it's. You're we could send you home but but we're not 100% sure that you could control this so we think we should induce you because it was I was far enough along and so it was a Tuesday morning and they said at 5:30 in the morning we're going to bring you down to induce you and they oh this is kind of gross but they made me take a Suppository which just really woo.

What happened is I ran into a telephone post. And I. I had cuts. I still have a scar here. I pushed. I had my fingers, my thumbs. I was holding the steering wheel like this, and when I hit the telephone post, I bent the. Steering column upward and. I I remember breaking through the glass with my hands and luckily I didn't break. My thumbs I had. I guess it got hit mostly on this arm. It pushed in this area, so that doctor stated that I didn't break my thumb because I was it hit. I was able to. Use this part of ARM, but what I did do with a force. And I was wearing a seat belt. But. I ended up twisting my upper torso. So I was so much in pain and they fixed my ohh by the way I cut my face somehow I tore my my face right in here. I had to have plastic surgery and um. I had to go to a chiropractor because I couldn't even pick up my shoe. So I went to a chiropractor and. He took an X-ray and my spine was like an *** with the with the with the Force. Of hitting that. Telephone post. So it took me ohh about six months. I had acupuncture and they car practic was straightening my spine, pulling and tugging.

And so history repeats itself. He kicks the ball through somebody else's front window. Lands in the dudes lap where he's sitting innocently on his sofa trying to read the newspaper. He doesn't have a newspaper, but it knocks over a lamp, which is, you know, further damage that this little punk has got to pay for. And the man picks up the ball, goes to the window and looks out. The kid has already run off because he has a good understanding of consequences. Thank you. You're welcome. OK, so here is another set of sequences, and again I just you can take a look at the pictures, take your time, and then tell me a story with a beginning and middle end of the end. Small Child has a history of violent behavior, and so his mother is not inclined to let him take an umbrella to school because she thinks he'll probably just hit kids with it. And she checked weather.com this morning and it said it was like a 20% chance of rain, so he's probably OK. So the little kid goes off to school and his mom holds on to the umbrella. And lo and behold, as he's walking to school, it starts to rain and he's dismayed. Because not only was he right. He also now doesn't have an umbrella until he runs back home. And he frowns at his mother because he's a kid and he's not allowed to say I told you so. And his mother relents and gives him an umbrella with which to walk to school. But he's already wet, so it's kind of. You know, immaterial at this point. For small child you should not hit people with things. This wouldn't happen. All right. And this is not a sequence, it's just a scene. So I want you to kind of look at what's happening in this scene and tell me a story again for the beginning and middle and end. It was a nice morning and this bird was in the tree singing. At which point the cat thought to itself and the cat. I'm supposed to chase birds. I've not been living up to my full potential, and so the cat climbs the tree. Only to realize that that bird is kind of far out there and that branch is kind of narrow and the cat is not really about that and so it just kind of gives up on the bird. And goes to the end of a different branch because you can't get down. So he might as well look like he did it on purpose. At which point? The little girl riding by on her tricycle. Seize the cat. And thinks to herself. That cat needs rescuing. Because I'm nosey. And so she goes, and she reaches for the cat. But the cat is too scared to come down, and they're certainly not going to jump into a strange world's arms, because it's a cat, and they're ordinary. And so the girl goes and gets her dad. And the dad comes back with a ladder that he puts up against the tree and he climbs up. With the goal of getting the cat. But then he also realizes that the branch kind of narrows out there, and he's not really about that, so he goes to climb back down the ladder. When the dog notices the cat, just a stray dog, it lives by the school that you know, goes to the playground sometimes and the kids like to pet it. It's a nice dog, but it sees the cat. And it goes barking up to the tree and it knocks over the ladder on accident. And so the man is stuck in the tree even though. That's not that tall. The man is a big old baby. And he's stuck in the tree with the dog barking. Barking up the right tree. And so he pulls his cell phone out of his pocket. It's probably a flip phone. It'd be a Nokia, like something really sturdy.

Issue. All right, great. We're into the same thing with these. Just take a look at them and then whenever you're ready, a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end. OK, the little boy is the woman's son. Is refusing an umbrella, as mothers saying he may need for today. He's like, I'll be fine without it. And then of course, it starts to rain on him and he's not appreciating the rain too much. And he comes home and his mother sees that he is sucking wet. He comes back for the umbrella soon, and then he gets the umbrella and goes his merry way. Alright, great. Same thing with this one. It's a little bit different. So I'm an entire scene. So you want to look at the whole picture and then a story with the beginning of middle and an end whenever you are ready. It looks like the little girl's cat got the tree and her father or older brother or somebody kind of the tree trying to rescue the cat.

But remember one thing when the clock strikes. Midnight, you must already have returned from the ball, so Cinderella promised to do that. She went to the ball. The Prince fell madly in love with her and she with him, and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock struck 12. So she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could, and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step. That was the only thing that the Prince had to identify her with.

So he sent a courtier round to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper and said anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her.

You know, now that I think about it, when we lived in Switzerland, we didn't travel around Europe quite so much, but we did do a lot of traveling in Switzerland. And and walking around our village because. Switzerland doesn't have anything like urban sprawl. So you have this unique little village surrounded by farms and then they have pat walking paths everywhere because the Swiss loved to walk. And so we could walk like to the next village or through and basically going by the fields, or we could walk through the woods and they had passed going through the woods. It was just absolutely gorgeous. And so his company, meanwhile, bought. A French scale company John worked for weighing. In his case it was weighing heavy duty like trucks and railroad cars and. They bought a scale company in France and so we were asked to move to France, which was like throwing me into the briar patch because I was a French teacher and so this was. Like.

So Cinderella is now left in the home with her stepmother. And her two step sisters, who really were never so great to her anyway. But now that her dad is gone, she is treated very terribly and she's no longer really a family member. She's treated like the maid, the slave.

They weren't in the castle they got an invitation to to a ball. The Prince was going to give a ball, and Cinderella used to. She could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance. And so when news came of this ball, she was also silently very excited about it. But the 2 girls you know, of course they were going. They had an invitation. And somehow I forget some of the details in between. But there was a fairy godmother who ends up you know helping working some magic and Cinderella does go to the bowl like a pumpkin that the what was that gets turned into a a carriage and with horses and she's got a beautiful gown on and she just looks. Really just beautiful. And she, the Prince, of course, you know, sees her right away. And you know, one of those across the crowded room and they danced all night and it was very romantic. And you could see the sour faces on those two step sisters. Those that were there were set the step sisters. Was that another story, the wicked step sisters? I don't know. Anyhow, those horrible faces like. So anyway, the the one caveat was that Cinderella had to be home by midnight. And you see in the the the clock is striking 12 and she's saying goodbye to the Prince. Of course he doesn't want to let her leave and she's late. She's running down this, you know, a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe, one of her glass slippers. And. The Butler or whoever Major Domo from the palace was sent around, you know, to the town to find who fits into the shoe. And Cinderella gets locked up. You know the mother, that horrible mother thought that, you know, they crammed the shoe on one of her daughters. I remember their feet were ugly too. And the mice ends up getting ohh, she was locked in this room, you know, they didn't want her on the scene. And the mice brought her the key. She got out and tried on the show. Of course it fit perfectly. She married the handsome Prince and lived happily ever after, one hopes. And I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at that wedding. Those are those horrible people. All right. So let's move on to something a little bit different. Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich, OK? Now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here. Otherwise, it's an open face. They don't call it a sandwich, right? So be nice, We'll we'll pretend we have two pieces of bread, and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread, then the peanut butter I put on with the knife on each piece of bread."}, {"segment_name": "wright67a_391818_630121.wav", "azure_transcription": "No, it's it's, you know, kind of brought the whole family together.

But that's well, there was this little girl named Cinderella who was like really cute little girl and but unfortunately her mother, something nasty happened to her. I think she went to the.

Like the Prince is like this totally hot dude where Cinderella just is. Totally got the hots for this guy.

And then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the bar and into these really cool horse that pulls the ball carriage. And because you have to pull up the castle on a carriage or they won't let you into the ball. So anyways, they get into the, she gets into the pumpkin and the fairy godmother even puts some like air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin. And they went to the ball and they got to the castle and they were able to sneak in and you know, she's kind of hanging out with all the other pretty ladies. And you know, the fairy godmother, the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters, they're kind of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her. And even when they see her, they don't even think it's her because she's so pretty. Anyways, the Prince comes in and. You know, they have the dance and they're all dancing around.

I wasn't being careful because I was looking through the camera and I took one too many steps to the left from about four feet off the ground and. Was above an area that was gravel and the gravel was big chunks of gravel that were in fact embedded in concrete. So it's I took one step too many and tumbled off the left side. Just instinctively put out my elbow to stop myself and the elbow get and. I was lying there for bed, a bit winded and electricians came over and. Checked on me and I said, oh, I'm fine, you know, I'll get out of you up in minute. But then I realized I really couldn't stand up because my leg hurt and the left arm elbow was swelling up in a very, very swollen and I couldn't not move my lower arm at all. So they asked if they should call an ambulance and they said, oh, that's really not necessary and I'll probably be OK in a bit, but. The longer I was there, the more I realized I couldn't stand up because of the leg, which turned out to be a very minor problem, but the arm was definitely a serious problem. And the more I most flying there, the colder I was getting because the ground had been in the 40s that morning and the ground was really quite cold and it was getting shivers and. And they did in fact call an ambulance who came and. When they came over to. Check on how to Get Me Out of there because it was kind of an enclosed place with some old fencing stacked up and. It wasn't really obviously couldn't just pick me up and Get Me Out of there, but. First, they wanted to check to see. If I had had head injuries so they asked me some questions and. One of the questions was where I was, so I told them I was at the. Cyclotron building but. By that point it was known as the. ASAT Hall, which is the. The. Science and Accelerator Technology Hall. But it had also changed its name to the mess hall, which was the Multidisciplinary Science and Accelerator Technology Hall and. No science hall. And of course they didn't know any of that. And but the worst. The first question was. That I was hoping they weren't going to ask me who the president was. So I said please don't ask me that. So. They wrapped some. Kind of canvas strap around me to keep the arm stabilized and then. And then with one of them on either side, they could get Stand me Up."}, {"segment_name": "wright10a_989541_1227676.wav", "azure_transcription": "Good dog, Carl. Carl lived in a family.

Carl carried the baby on his back, just like someone would ride a horse. They were going to have such a good time together. They walked down the hall into Mother's bedroom. It looked so soft. They jumped up onto the bed. And the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch. Afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to moms vanity. There, the baby got into momma's powder. Perfumed powder. And he dusted Carl's nose. It tickled Carl's nose, but he liked the smell of the powder and he was having so much fun with baby. They played dress up. Carl looked so cute with Mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can. On top of them, just like a little purple hat. Baby had a hat too. Baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff they looked at themselves to in the mirror and they smiled. This was so much fun. Next, Carl took the baby to the laundry shoot. Ohh.

There was also a a growth around the size of a nickel and so anyway, it had to be open. It had to be open. Shoulder surgery and I went with supposedly the best doctor and. Anyway. That night, and it was considered a day surgery. That night, the nurse came in and she went to my arm. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? I said, yes. Can you feel this? No. No, No, no, no. So she's like, oh, don't worry about that. She goes, sometimes it takes 24 hours for the block to wear off. And I had a horrible, horrible, horrible night of pain, like. I was like out of my mind in pain and I kept ringing the buzzer all night and then like it round. Ohh, I don't know, 3-4 in the morning. The nurse came in and I think she had me up to here with my pain and she's like, alright, I'm giving you morphine and the next thing I know she came in and she was like in my thigh and that was the morphine.

You know, it wasn't it. I guess from the time of the MRI, it went from a partial tear to a complete tear. And the growth that was a nickel was the size of a golf ball. And he also discovered that the bicep was torn while he was in there and he grabbed bone from my collarbone. And so basically he was like all over from collarbone all the way down to the bicep and, you know, lots of nerves in there, whatever. So he's like. It it was rough, so I understand that. So I said OK, and then he said so for the pain, he said I can give you another block. Now I had one for the surgery, so now it's like say 6:00-ish in the morning and I was supposed to be day surgery, he said. I can give you another block and it will take you off, he said.

Now I'm, you know, still still have the morphine in my system. But yet I remember this. And I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do because I was remembering what the nurse said that I, you know, 24 hours. And it was kind of like it did concern me the night before. So I was like, I don't know. I don't know. And he said, well, Bridget, he said you. I I've got to see everybody else on the floor. So you think about it and by the time I come back here, you had to have a decision. So I was like. So I was like, but I may never get he was well, it's 5050. It doesn't happen to somebody but you know your chances increase so boom, off he's gone. And I was like fighting to stay awake because I knew Bruce was dropping the kids off at school, at high school and I wanted to tell him, Bruce, do not let him give me the second block which eventually boost appeared. I told him that I told him everything. I just told you I'm like, I don't want the block. Meanwhile I was out of my mind and pain. There was a wonderful male nurse.

So they give her all kinds of work to do. And meantime her little friends to mice help with getting her dress ready. Now the evil step sisters have thrown things away that they don't want. They're no good. So they take them and make her dress. She has this Pretty Little dress. And she's ready on time. The evil step sisters take the the necklace and the ribbon, and they just rip it right off of her dress. And off they go to the ball. Cinderella is very, very sad, sitting outside crying to her, my friends and her dog when her fairy godmother comes and says, well, you get to go to the ball. And she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses and takes her over to the ball. She looks very nice. She dances with Prince Charming. You have a wonderful time, but she has to be back by midnight. So when the clock strikes 12, she runs down the stairs, but she loses A slipper, one of her glass slippers. She gets home just in time, but she has to walk because. The pumpkin the the carriage turned back into a pumpkin, the the horses turned back into mice and the dog turned the footman turned back into a dog. So then, um. The. I guess the Duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe and asking all the maidens throughout the village. So they get to Cinderella's house and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom so that she can't try it on just in case.

Put in a position of of servitude. With her aunt and cousins, and she actually became. Umm. Kind of an indentured servant, so she would serve them and clean. And she didn't even live in the house. She lived with the barn animals who became her friends. And she would Daydream. In the barn about visiting a castle in the Kingdom that was far away, but she could see it in the valley in the distance. But she imagined it would be. A long, long distance to ever be able to visit the castle. But one day, an invitation came from the Prince. That he was having a ball. And he invited Cinderella's aunt and sisters. And she assumed that she could go. And. Her barnyard friends revealed a secret. Chest to her. Which she opened to a book of magic. And from that book of magic she was able to conjure a dress and pearls to where did this go to this event? And she arrived to accompany her, her kin, and they absolutely rejected the possibility of her going. They ripped the necklace off her neck and she was in despair. So from this treasure chest and this book of magic, a fairy godmother appeared. A wise, powerful older woman. And she granted Cinderella's wish of attending the ball, but to do so she would have to go in costume and kind of disguise her appearance. So surrender Cinderella was dressed in magical finery with glass slippers and. New hair and makeup so she was virtually unrecognizable and is a final touch.

OK, and then the next picture is like her playing with the cat. And so she's responsible for all the chores. Then. And. They get an invitation to the ball and the two step sisters are really excited. And and Cinderella wants to go as well. And so the mice make her dress. And. With this step sisters, it's leftover materials and but when the step sisters see that they or that her dress is like made of. All their unwanted. Clothes and they rip it up. So she's really sad and. And she goes out in the garden, and the God very godmother. Comes to her and. Makes for, makes her. A secret that it's called, not a wagon. I think that we're right now. Really nice stress.

Alright, so I just have one more thing that I'm going to ask you to do. I would just like for you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. I would take two pieces of bread.

It was in early April. Quite a long time ago and I came home and I found. My Kitty had been hit by a car and was dead in front of my home. It was unspeakable. And it was devastating because. I came. To this place with this vision of safety for my animals, so it's very, very upsetting and. Umm. I went through grief. And then I. Did some prayers and time passed and it was coming up on summer solstice, so it was in June. And I started imagining, because the Kitty I lost was a girl. She was my only female. Umm, and I thought, gosh, my household really needs a female Kitty. And if if if a cat would just happen to cross my path, I would consider adopting a female, and if that cat just happened to be a tortoise shell, that would be even better. So I went to a party hosted by a friend of mine who lived in the country. And. She was taking care of a litter of kittens who had been born on her land. And there was one left.

I had a severe concussion. I had a kidney laceration, broken ribs and four pelvic fractures. So that, let's see. I was taken to a hospital on the east side.

What I learned from this. He was driving up and down Meridian St. He knew it was a hotel. He knew it was somewhere on Meridian St. But he didn't know which hotel and he had no way to call me and I had no way to call him. And what I learned from that experience and I I can't say I'm 100% perfect on it even today. But his auditory comprehension is horrible. And if I want to be sure. He understands it needs to be written down because he understands what he sees. But like most people with aphasia. They are the best fakers in the world, but they don't really mean to be. They just want to have it be the way it used to be. And so they'll nod their head. Yeah, they understand. And they don't understand.

I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guillain Barre Syndrome, and that's a type of paralyzing. It's kind of, I think it was called French polio because the men were from France and I was on a vacation out over in San Diego with friends, and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet. And I was stumbling. I was having a hard time walking. And I knew something was wrong and I just. I really kind of thought it was fate. I thought maybe I'd have brain tumor or something really pretty serious. But my daughter was with me and we had planned on going to Universal Studios and I wasn't in pain. So. But I was just having a hard time walking. Yeah. Embrace starts at your fingers and toes and then it works. Works in. So I can't. I can remember this going to Universal Studios in a wheelchair. So by that evening, by the time we all go back to our hotel, I was really quite concerned. I did sleep in the next morning they took me to Scripps Medical Center in the San Diego area. And the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it. Because Neon Bray. Effects it's it's an autoimmune disease And he asked me if I had had the flu recently and I had and so the the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system and this was what was happening. So they told first they want to admit me to the hospital and I said no way. I was going back to Phoenix. Ohh. And they did certain they asked me to like shuffle a deck of cards. I couldn't do that and snap my fingers. I couldn't do that. So I got back in the car with my friends and my daughter was with us. And he said if you have trouble breathing because it can go all the way and it's, you know, affects your muscle, affects your muscles. To find the nearest hospital, but I got back home and. It took me about 06 weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery. For about 6 weeks. I couldn't drive a car. I couldn't. I could feed myself, but I couldn't cut anything up. I could shower, but I couldn't turn on the shower. I had no strength in my hands or my feet. I couldn't stand on my toes, any of that kind of thing. So then I started it. Wherever it goes, you know from the inside, from the outside to the inside of your body. And then it stops and it's your your body stops, starts healing again. Then it was a slow recovery. I would start walking just out around the block a little bit, but I do remember. The first time I went to a grocery store with my sister. She was living with us at the time and I just felt like a old lady. And this was over 20 years ago. So I was in my 40s and I was just holding on to the grocery cart for dear life because my balance was so poor and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over. But I recovered. I still have a little weakness. Occasionally my hands I I can occasionally have a hand trimmer, but I feel like I'm 99%.

I had sold more property, close, more Closings than ever had and started feeling short of breath.

Finally in October, my doctor came back and. I went back to her with a list of symptoms and she decided I needed a stress test because I'd never had one and this was a nuclear stress test. So I took my stress test and the doctor turned his back and started talking to his assistant. And I thought, oh, and he turned and looked at me and said, you have flunked your stress test and I want you back in one of my rooms immediately. I think you have considerable. Cardiovascular problems. So anyway, he wanted me to go into the hospital the next day for heart Cath and I told him I was sorry I couldn't do that I I had an appointment. Real estate appointment that was very, very important to me and to the lady that I was working with and and he said what about? Thursday and I said I can't do it Thursday and he's his glasses are going further down on his nose. He said how about Friday? And I said that'll work I can I can do it Friday. So anyway I go for my heart Cath on Friday. And. He didn't even let me sit up afterwards, he said. You have blockages and I want you to have surgery today. And so I had triple bypass surgery that afternoon. And so that was pretty traumatic because my family never thought of me as ever being sick. It was like worried a lot about their father, but they didn't worry about mom because I was constantly going and doing and everything. So anyway, I had the surgery. Umm, my recovery was. Was good. I had a good attitude. I never once got depressed because I felt so grateful that. That it had my problems have been found and I could go on. And so I went through cardiac rehab at Central Baptist and I did everything they told me to do and I was in rehab for probably about six months. And have. Recovered. Um. However, two years later I did find that two of my bypasses were blocked. And it's it's a genetic thing. I've done everything I was told to do diet. I've been doing the diet thing for years and so I had to have a stent. And then a year later, I had to have another stent. So since then I have done well. It's it's been 2 years now since I had a stent. And I'm, I'm back to normal as far as I'm concerned.

Because he doesn't have any social graces because he was, he's a wolf. He was raised as a in a Wolf Pack. And so he doesn't know how creepy this is, but he also kind of wants to eat her, so he's a little bit aware of how creepy this is. And Red Riding Hood's like, I'm not sure I should talk to strangers. And the wolf says, show me what you've got in your basket and your rifles through a basket because obviously he can take it. He's a wolf and she's a six year old girl in the woods on her own because that's smart. And. I'm not sure what happens, I guess you just. He's like he talks to her, that's what it is. He talks to her and he says. What you're doing with this basket kid and because she is 6 years old, not very smart, she says I'm going to my grandma's with it. She's sick. She is up in that hill. You take a left at the lightning struck tree and a right at the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and then you just keep going straight over the bridge. And there's my grandma's cottage. She gives some really explicit instructions to how to get to her grandma's cottage. She's six years old. And the wolf drops the basket and he says ohh, that sounds great. But I'm never going to see you again. Don't look for me at your grandma's place. I'm definitely not going there. And he bounds off in the direction of the lightning struck tree and the rock that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And Little Red Riding Hood says that was completely ordinary. I see nothing suspicious about this. And she picks up all the stuff and puts it back in the basket and starts going on to Grandma's. And. Obviously, before she gets here, the wolf gets to Grandma's cottage and he listens at the door and he hears. Grandma singing along to Led Zeppelin. And says grandma clearly can't hear me. Because she's singing along to that heavy metal music. So he opens the door and he knocks Grandma out and ties her up and put her in the closet. Where she just sits there, kind of sniffling and humming, muds upline to herself. And he turns down her crazy tunes and gets into her bed. No. No. Yes. To make, he has to take your clothes first. He's a weird wolf. Social graces, not his Forte. He. Gets scrambled onto her underwear. It puts on Grandma's 90 and like her cap and stuff. He doesn't cover up his ears because he's pretty dumb too. He puts on her night cap and then he ties her up and stuff through her closet to sniffle and hum. Led Zeppelin. And he gets into her bed and he pulls the covers up. Right here. And wait through Little Red Riding Hood. And literally, Riding Hood comes up to Grandma's door eventually, probably like half an hour later because she's 6. And she knocks on the door, and the wolf says ohh come in dearie. Riding Hood says. That's weird. My grandma never calls me deary, but I trust this situation implicitly. And so she comes in and she looks over to the bed, and her first response is not. There's a wolf in my grandma's bed. Her first response is hi grandma, I'm 6 and I'm stupid. And she goes up to the bed and her grandma says, ohh, Her grandma the wolf says, ohh, what are you? Bring me dear here. And she says, well, I brought you stuff from my mom because I heard you were sick from dancing naked in the rain. You need to not do that so often. You should also tell me what to do. To dance better in the rain naked. And the wolf says. OK. He doesn't know how to dance naked in the rain.

I think that's happened in the original story. I don't know what Disney said, but that's not important because what is important is that when she was a little girl, little cheerful girl, very nice, her father remarried to this not very nice woman who had two not very nice daughters. Big noses and angry eyes. And. Basically. I'm pretty sure her father died also. I don't remember that from the movie. I figure it must have been, you know, too tragic for kids. But to grandmothers thing, they kill everybody's parents off. So Cinderella at this point is left with her stepmother and her two step sisters, and no parental. You know, oversight that actually cares about her. So she grows up as basically the servant, basically the slave of this family. She doesn't get paid, and her only friends are the cute little furry animals like mice and dogs and horses. There's a cat. Named Lucifer, I'm pretty sure. Actually named Um, there's a cat named Lucifer who belongs to the Step family who is always terrorizing her mice friends and so she has to protect them and they're all, you know, good buddies. They sing songs together. And then? One day, the king and the castle up in the distance, very far away, Cinderella looks longingly out the window because she wants something she can't have, because that is the fundamental facet of human existence. The king says to his advisor, I want my son to get married because he's getting on in years and he wants a grandkid. Pretty much is his only motivation for that. Which doesn't seem like a very good reason to urge your air apparent to get married to me. But. The heart wants what it wants, and so he decided. The king decides to throw this enormous ball, to which every single eligible maiden in the Kingdom will be invited. And by eligible maiden, I mean probably over the age of 13. And not already married. The trouble is probably negotiable. So the Step family and Cinderella get the invitation and they're all psyched because this is great. One of them could marry the Prince. Not Cinderella, obviously, because she's hideous and not worth it. But one of the stepdaughters could. And so, leading up to the day of the ball, the stepdaughters get the beautiful gowns and they're all excited and Cinderella. Her mice and bird buddies make her address because they want her to go to the ball. Also, because they're just nice, they're good friends. And so Cinderella sees this, and she gets so excited because this means she can go to the ball. And she puts on the dress and she goes downstairs to meet her step family at the door for them to get into the carriage to go off to the ball. And they said to themselves. There, and they rip her clothes and make her dress completely unwearable so she can't go to the ball because they're mean. And. At this point, Cinderella is kind of grinding to herself, and I'm inclined to be like crying to herself because she's a baby. But also, I would probably cry because that was a nice dress. And like if mice and birds made something for me and somebody ruined it, I would cry. So she's sitting there crying, and all of a sudden her fairy godmother comes. Why she has a fairy godmother? Nobody's really sure, presumably because she's so pure of heart. But if I got another comes and says Bippity boppity Boo. And everything is wonderful. And the pumpkin turns into a carriage.

Little Red Riding Hood, I'm going to prepare a basket for you to take to your grandmother's house. And. I even think that her mother and gives her advice about the path to take to grandmother's house, to take the, you know, the most direct path and not to Lolly gag because. That's when trouble happens and. So Little Red Riding Hood. Actually, I think in the in my story, Little Red Riding Hood actually wants to take the most right path, but the. There's some reason why she can't and I think it has something to do. With the signpost. Bing Ohh I know why because the wolf. Spies or Red Riding Hood coming with? The bags get to a grandmother's house and he says, a little girl, where are you going? And she says, I'm going to my brothers house. You should talk to strangers. That's bad. I don't tell them where you're going. And so he jumps ahead of her in the path on the way to her grandmother's house and switches the sign. So as to delay her arriving at her grandmother's house. So the wolf. Goes to grandmother's house. And he. Ohh. Knock on the door, that's a different story. He gets in the grandmother's house and he gobbles her up hole. That's important. And. Um. Little, meanwhile, Little Red Riding with Hood is unknown, does not know that this happened. And the wolf. Well, I think his end objective is to eat Little Red Riding Hood, which you would think he'd be stated by eating grandma, but he's not. Um. Puts on grandmother's clothes and gets into her bed, which isn't creepy. It's a fairy tale. Um. And when Little Red Riding Hood arrives. He. Lures her end. By acting like grandmother and then.

Allergy issues and in particular I am allergic to most dogs, which is why we have a poodle because they're non shedding dogs and I am allergic to all cats very badly. And I'm also allergic to in a trees and very various molds, grasses yadda yadda yadda. But cats are probably the worst culprit for me, so when I was in high school, probably a freshman or sophomore. In high school, I think. My sisters were out of the house at that point, so it was just me living with my mom and dad. And one summer we took a vacation down. No, it was in the fall, It was in the fall and we went down for like an extended weekend to visit some friends of ours that were living in Arkansas. We, I don't know why, did not really think about the fact that they had. Two dogs and a cat, I believe. Shedding dogs and a cat, so we were going to stay two nights with them. So the first night came and we were in their home having dinner and I could tell I was starting to feel little and and it was always kind of a wonderful thing because my mother, having been my mother, always could look across the room. And when we would be in somebody's home and she knew when I was starting to have an asthma attack, she would look at me and say, it's time for you to go, isn't it? So we kind of reached that point, but we were supposed to stay there. Well, you know, they put the dog in another room. People try that kind of thing, which, of course, never works because the animal lives there. And I and I can't remember why we even opted to just stay there. But we did. And our maybe I said, oh, I'll be OK. I'll be OK. I took medicine. And and whatnot. But by the middle of the night, I was beyond OK. And it was, you know, to the point where I could not be in the environment simply because I couldn't breathe and there were no inhalers. Back in those days, it was liquid medicine that A was less effective and B took a long time to activate. Plus, if you stay in the space where the stimulus is, your medicine is only going to last a short bit of time. So by the middle of the night I could bear it no longer. And my loving, loving father said let's go to the car and sleep in the car. So he slept in the car with me that night and I. So then the next day I was better enough that we carried on with whatever the day's activities were, but we spent enough time in the house. I just couldn't get past it. I was. I was so affected and I am not sure whether we even stayed at that house. I can't imagine that we did stay in that house that night, but it just continued to get worse.

There's another class that's MMD which is a little. More advanced. And so in that class we communicate by sly language, like this would be, you know, please, or you know something like this like the doctor or the nurse. So sometimes we do sign language with those kids and we couldn't communicate with them that way. OK, the beginning of the story. It looks like there is this little girl or probably between 8 and 10 year old little girl and somehow, I don't know how, she got into a raging river, but it looks really cold. Umm. And. The fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her and he has all his equipment on and basically he has to go out into this raging river and he's grabbing on to some kind of tree limb.

Cinderella is having to do all the housework and she's taking care of everything and the evil step sisters or just, you know, bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do. So Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were there in the farm area. And she would talk to them and they would talk to her because they had that special communication. Then one day from where Cinderella was at, she when she was talking with the animals, she could see like the whole town that she lived in, and off in the distance she could see the castle where the Prince lived.

But I'm Cinderella and I won't ever happen because I have to make sure that I have to take care of my stepmother and my evil step sisters. Meanwhile, over in the castle. The advisor to the Prince is starting to get worried because the Prince is still single and people in the town are starting to talk. So he's a little bit worried about it. So he says, OK, here's what we'll do. We will put this whole proclamation thing out and we will get all the Single Ladies to come to the castle and we'll let the Prince pick one. You know, with all the women, there's got to be one that he's going to like, so we'll bring them all here. So they send out a message to everybody in the village in the town. They say, OK, we're having this big birthday party. For the Prince, Bring your single daughters over here. And because he's going to be picking a wife and the evil stepmother gets this message and she says, well, this is great, I'm going to put my daughters because then we can get out of this hovel and move back into a big castle and we'll be all rich and famous. And Cinderella thinks, wow, that would be kind of cool. Maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at, you know, sewing and everything and I've actually made a dress. So, you know, I should be able to go too, because it says all the single daughters. So she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room and the stepsisters see it and decide, wow, she looks a lot better than we do, so we can't let that happen. So they rip up her dress and then they take her and they, like, shove her in a closet and lock her away. And then they take off and go, and Cinderella is really sad. And she's like, Oh no, this is really a bummer. And while she's upset, she finds this book. And while flipping through the book, she sees a reference to a fairy godmother. So she reads the reference and all of a sudden **** fairy godmother shows up and she says, well, Cinderella, I'm here to help you out because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things. I'm gonna grant you some wishes and we're going to get you to this ball. And so Santa Real says, OK, well, what? How do we make this happen? She said, well, first we need a way to get you there.

Shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called Angie. They called it then angioneurotic edema. But it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called. Hereditary angioedema. The difference between angioedema and hereditary angioedema is that angioedema, which is like the hives, can be treated with antihistamines. Hereditary angioedema cannot. It has to be the only thing that until recently, the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine. During that time, shortly after I was diagnosed, my throat again swelled up just out of the clear blue. I went to urgent care. In urgent care. They started an IV on me and the doctor.

However, Cinderella stepmother says ohh no you can't go to the ball because you have too many chores to do and forces Cinderella to do even more chores because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own 2 stepdaughters and does not want that competition for her daughters. So they get all ready to go to the ball and Cinderella goes through all her chores. And all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also, so they help her with the chores. But then she realizes that she cannot go to the ball because she doesn't have a dress. And so in a puff of magic, her fairy godmother comes to her and says, I will help you Cinderella. So she makes a beautiful dress up here with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball that is made out of a pumpkin. And the mice she made waves her magic wand and makes into fine horses that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball. So in the meantime, just before Cinderella takes off for the ball, though, she says remember this spell is only good until midnight and after midnight. The coach will turn back into a pumpkin and your little the horses will turn back into your little friends again, so make sure you're out of there by midnight. So Cinderella goes to the ball and nobody recognizes her because she's dressed beautifully, she's clean, she smells good, and the Prince is so taken with her he cannot believe his luck that he has found this beautiful young woman and falls in love with her instantly. Love at first sight. But as they're taking one of their last dances, she hears the gong from the clock tower and knows that it is midnight and she knows she has to leave quickly. But he doesn't want her to leave, and he holds her back and she says no, I must go.

I don't know if you heard this or not. If I mentioned this. One of the things that I have been doing for the last 10-12 years is that I tell stories on a volunteer basis at Riley Children's Hospital. And it is not uncommon for us to be sent to the room of a patient who is nonverbal or has great speech difficulties for whatever reasons. So umm, I very much have learned from that. A Not to make assumptions that because their speech is difficult that they cannot understand the story that I'm telling them. And that has, that is a lesson, because it's easy to make that assumption, as I'm sure you know. So I have learned to try to take cues from their eye contact, from their facial expressions, from their motions. That may be jerky, that may be just excitement, that that is. The response to the story. And while I can, I have no capacity to measure their cognitive understanding and capacity with this story. I can sense their emotional and response to whatever it is that they do understand in the story, and it has been rather remarkable to have an emotional connection. Even when there is no speech coming back on their end. So, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad, or from any time from you or a kid or more recently. I'm going to mute myself now and you can begin. This time I will tell you about the birth of my first child. So. It was 22 years ago, on March 14th. I was due on March 9th. I had the good fortune of having a fairly benign, you know, easy pregnancy. And nothing had happened. Nothing had happened. We were on to day five after the due date, and I that day was singing in a a very unusual thing, singing with a choir that I was part of a small chamber group. I should say that I was part of at a wedding. So the chamber group was singing at the wedding. So I went to the wedding and we sang and I did, kind of. Notice that umm. You know, I felt a little bit of cramping here and there, but you know, whatever. And and the wedding was beautiful. It was very unusual to have a chamber group sing at the wedding. Then I came home and I was just sort of vaguely noticing that this happened periodically, but I really didn't think it was happening. Maybe I was in denial. And I called my sister who lived. I was in Sacramento at the time. She was in Southern California, and she is five years older than me and three kids older than me. So she already has three children.

Big garbage bags so I could put the horse blanket in it for the winter and kind of put it up for the winter. And she as I put up on the shelf. She couldn't understand how the horse blanket was going to fit on the shelf where I keep the garbage bags. So. And she came back with garbage bags and she had cleared off the shelf where I keep the garbage bags, but. Horse blankets is as big as this table and the shelf will keep the garbage bags on is. Maybe 6 inches high. So she still brought me the garbage bags and she gave me very puzzled look like she was gonna do with them. So I hold the bag out, let me get the blanket for you, and I pull up the blanket and I put it in the garbage bag and she said, how's this going to fit on the shelf? I said I wasn't going to put it on the shelf, just just gonna bag it up for the winter. When I was in 3rd grade, I slipped over my girlfriend's house.

We couldn't get ahold of her mom at dinners before cell phones for trying to. Their mom didn't tell us what restaurant she went to. She never cell phone. They made-up calling like the fire department or the Police Department. We're really scared we weren't going to get Bonita out, and she had no air in there.

So they they took away my tonsils and I remembered being said ice cream, all the ice cream you can eat after the operation. And once that was taken away, I was back to normal. And. One of the things that has stuck in my mind, as I say, I can't remember exactly but I think it was about four and this thing went on for about 3 months. So one of the things that I remember was that I was not supposed to move very much. I was supposed to. Be in bed and not moving very much, and whenever I was left alone, I remember that I would jump on the bed as a sign of rebellion. Against this order, this doctor's order that I was in state. You know, like just lies as still as I could. Which was impossible to expect a four year old to to follow that. So that's one of the things I remember. I also remember. The doctor coming in to because I was put in my parents bedroom which was larger than my own during the day and just one of the images I have was this doctor would come and he would. Take the lampshade. Off of sign. Bedside table lamp and put it on my head as a hat. And you did that like three or four times. And then I didn't like it that much. But he kept doing it. He thought it was a funny joke. And so it's one of the things that I've stuck with. But so that was not a stroke. It wasn't a mental thing, but it wasn't allergic. Reaction to my tonsils. So the next thing I'd like to ask is, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? That's a very broad range of what we could mean by that. Um. But if you if you could call, yeah, died of Alzheimer's, OK, so that you can probably, umm, in that case please tell me kind of what the issues or problems were and what you did to try to communicate with that person. Um, I, of course, stood, sort of. 2nd row To the problem. My father-in-law and my my wife at the time were the most. Affected by it? And I remember trying to.

And then she, Cinderella, wanted to go as well, but they didn't want her to go. And so she put on she didn't have the best dress.

So first you would need to wash your hands and. Then you go into the kitchen and get a loaf of bread. You take the Thai. Twist tie on the bread. They take it off and open the pack. And if it's a brand new pack, you probably want to throw away the first piece, the end piece. You probably don't want to use that, but you grab two pieces of bread and you can put them on a plate or a napkin separately. And then you go and grab a knife and the peanut butter and the Jelly. And so first we're going to choose either the peanut butter and Jelly, but let's just go with the peanut butter. So you'll twist the top off of the peanut butter and stick the knife into it. And get some peanut butter on the knife and then you'll use the knife to spread it on one of the pieces of bread and then you'll go. When you finish spreading the peanut butter, you'll go and wash them and fall off. And then you'll open your jar of Jelly. It's either it's probably going to be a twist top as well.

Soon the step sisters found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the Prince as well, and they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress. Oh no, Cinderella thought. Now what shall I do? How will I ever get to meet the Prince and get away from my evil step sisters? Then out of nowhere, a beautiful good witch showed up and she granted Cinderella wish. The wish was that. She would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city that nothing would ever compare. She would also grant her a a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the Prince. The only exception was that she would have to be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin. Ohh, this is so wonderful, Cinderella said. Yes, I have to go. It is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball. Then I shall grant you your wish, said the good witch. And there she was, standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine. Crystals and diamonds everywhere, and the beautiful horse carriage. And off she went to the palace. There, everyone stood in line to meet the Prince. Finally, Cinderella got her turn and there she was. Ohh no, she said. It's almost 12. I cannot finish my dance with the Prince. So she hurriedly ran down the stairs, and as she ran down the stairs, one of her glass slippers fell off. The Prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown. Minutes later, Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags, and no riches anymore were on her. She went back to scrubbing the floors, mopping, wondering about her wish to become a Princess one day."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto62a_802604_1039864.wav", "azure_transcription": "I'll never agree to that.

For the care that I gave him and and so during that time the I started to change the the. The tube, I couldn't get it in and it scared me to death, so I called the surgeon, which was a cousin of his, to tell him that I couldn't get the tube back in. He said go over to the hospital and let them do it. Well, I took all of the things that were sterilized and told her, the doctor at the hospital what to do. And he couldn't do it, so he goes up to the. 5th floor to get a surgeon and he comes down a little fasting man with a mustache mustache and and and he and he reaches over to get the pair of gloves off the wall. I says no you can't use those. Those are not sterilized. He said it wouldn't hurt him if I picked up something off of the floor. And put it in his bag. I said. Let me tell you right now, he's laying there because of your negligence. You're not about to put something in his back. And he looked back at me and the two nurses to stand there. She looked. They looked at me. And he left the room. And he he told the man to go get him some sterile scissors. He turned around, looked at me sterilized. And and so he took those scissors and he was going into his bag and was going to stretch that area to try to get that that open so he could get the tube in. I said no, you're not either. You call his doctor right now. He's not about to be done that way. And so he left the room and he came back and he was a wheelchair and he said we'll take him up for X-ray. The doctor wants you come in on Monday. This was on a Friday and to have a. Heather. A scandal and so. He wasn't very happy. The nurses said what's wrong with you? And I told them about what had happened and they said aren't you afraid? I said I'm scared to death, but he needs help. So they took him upstairs and the doctor had a school over there. We never saw that doctor again. Don't know what happened to him. I think he lost his job. I don't know. I'm sorry about that. But I wasn't about to let my husband go through another ordeal. Of their negligence. And so anyway, it was about a month that. After that I developed hepatitis. And he had to stay and take care of me. I was. I was put to bed. He had to wait on me. I couldn't even move to Kirk and if I had been clean, haven't take care of his back. There was no way that I could. I wasn't able to. And so God's plans, better than ours is, He gave He. Healed his bag is the way I feel. Did the doctor say would never be, it'd be the rest of his life. He had his back so he could take care of me. And then as soon as I went back to work they told me I never worked again. I went back to work because they said he would be better than if I what was working and and so I went back to work.

So the cure, Ultimately the cure was to have a tonsil operation and have my tonsils removed. The process was a very long. In fact, the process was long because they did not diagnose. The cause of the illness? Early enough. So for a long time they were trying to figure out what was wrong. And then I remember my family changing the position, and then this physician who saw me for the first time. Since we need to, we need to take out his tonsils right away. And so I was bedridden and I had to stay in bed. But the rebel that I've always been, I would jump up and down on the bed just to. Show that I could do it in contradict the doctor's orders. So that was my most traumatic. But written experience other than, you know, flu, two or three day flu or stomach virus, that was my major illness and I was late going to kindergarten. Ohh, I'd always remember I spent some time trying to catch up with the rules. Everything was the way it had been for about a month. And I could not join them until a month later.

I was a teacher, I was teaching Spanish. I'm very fluent in Spanish and I was teaching Spanish at Salvo Regina University. In Newport, RI and one of the students in my class would completely refuse to do anything. He would not answer questions. He would not. Respond would not participate. He was. Excluding himself from the classroom. Every class. Every class. So eventually I said OK, I have a problem here. I tried different things to, you know, make making him a silent participant in in plays or skits that we would put on in class. And even that meant met with very partial cooperation from him. So I call them to meeting. And then he told me very long story of how his parents had spent so much money tutoring him or spent much money in hiring tutors to get him through high school. In math, in English, everything. And he had his aversion towards education that manifested itself in lack of participation in class. And it didn't help very much to establish the reason why he was not participating. He could have been just making it up, but. I think he was. At least he made the effort of coming to the meeting. To explain to me why he would not participate, but I took that as a positive move on his part."}, {"segment_name": "UNH1018_1025730_1262870.wav", "azure_transcription": "Look at the pictures first.

Now the stepmother and step sisters treated Cinderella very poorly. They made her do all the cleaning up, all the washing, even though the family was fairly well off and could afford to hire servants. Cinderella's father was most often away. So that left her alone, to the mercy of her evil stepmother and step sisters. Now Cinderella grew close to the animals that her family owned, the horses. The mice not technically owned by her family, but living in the house and the birds of the forest and could get them to help her with the chores every now and. One day, Cinderella found out that her family was going to the Princess Ball. She wanted nothing more but to accompany them to it. She took her time and made her own dress and to go with her family because her stepmother and step sisters would not allow her to be provided. And upon learning that she had planned to do this, her stepmother and her step sisters tore the dress from her, tore tore into it, and made it unserviceable to go to the ball. Now, after her step, sisters and stepmother had left to go to the ball. A fairy godmother came to Cinderella and told her that she could help her get the ball on time and charm the handsome Prince. And to do this, she transformed her pumpkin into a carriage and the mice, the horses and the birds into appropriate helpers for Cinderella. She also gave her a beautiful white dress and a pair of glass slippers. She, however, told Cinderella this Cinderella had to be back by midnight or else the magic would wear off. Went to the ball. Fabulous time. She was noticed by everyone upon entering, including the Prince, and the Prince asked her to dance, choosing to dance with her over the Two Step Sisters. Neither of them recognized it somehow. She enjoyed her dance with the Prince so much that she lost track of time. And just before it hit 11, she noticed. Or just before it hit 12, she noticed that the time was about to be up, so she ran from him. Without an explanation, he chased after her down the steps of the palace. She tripped and stumbled out of one of her glass slippers and kept running. Prince stopped and picked it up, knowing that he could never catch up to her, as it were. She managed to just escape the castle before the magic world, leaving her back to looking like plain old Cinderella.

Becoming a young man and he was looking for his Princess. So they decided they were going to have this ball and they would bite or invite all the single young girls to this ball and he would choose someone in from those that come to the ball. Well, of course Cinderella didn't get to go. And she was kind of upset. She thought she would wanted to go really bad and. So it just so happened that her fairy godmother appears and said, well, Cinderella. If you would like to go. We can, we can fix it so you can go so. The fairy godmother. She dresses Cinderella up in a very fine gown and ball dress and tiara and everything, and she. Takes a pumpkin and turns it into a carriage. Beautiful carriage with horsemen and and.

So he decides he's going to take Cinderella and dance with her, and he does and. During the dance, he becomes enchanted with her and thinks, well, this she's fine. Young lady, this is. I think this is the gal I'd like to spend some more time with well. Somewhere along the way. Cinderella has glass slippers and. Her fairy godmother told her. Now at a certain time in the ball, you're going to have to leave and so. That time comes and Cinderella is getting ready to leave and she runs out.

They take her own back to the house, so should be there when the. Rest of the family gets back. So. She's there and they come back and they're telling the story about the ball and everything, the fun they have and what went on. And I'm sure they mentioned this story about, well, he picked this girl and she lost her slipper. Well, the Prince decides the next day that he wants to find this girl, so he sends one of his.

And my mom and my brother, who was in medical school at the time, said it it just wasn't possible. We couldn't care for her. I was secretly hoping maybe we could take her home, because for me, there's something very sacred about being able to to be in your space. So that didn't happen. She remained in the hospital and got progressively worse. And it happened over a period of weeks. And. I remember visiting her. In a hospital. And there was light coming in the window and windows.

They had their cereal on the table. They were only three and five at the time, and I then just put my head on the kitchen table. I couldn't even lift it. Up and I called my sister because I knew I needed to get help. I was vomiting vehemently and it just and I had been for a long time. I knew something was not right and because I actually had been sick for several days now that I think about it because I hadn't showered and I called the doctor they said yeah you need to be seen and and I called my sister and she thought I wouldn't wanted her to just stay with the kids and I said no. But you have to take me. My mom will stay with the kids, but I can't even drive because I can't not throw up.

And when I went, I literally dragged myself into the bathtub because I normally shower and I could not even stand enough to shower. And I went to I was cleaning under my arm and there was this huge lump. I thought to myself, Oh my God, I developed breast cancer, like overnight and but it was like noticeably enlarged. So I I thought it was strange though, because I was sick of my stomach. It didn't seem connected. So my sister took me and she right away understood when she saw me how sick I was and and that I kept, you know, having to throw up in the car on the way to the doctor. It was just so bad. I walked in and I we had just moved in Annapolis. I'd never been to this doctor before. So I met the nurse practitioner first. That's who saw me. She looked at me and within 10 seconds she said, I have never met you in my life. You are very, very sick. I can tell that it was like, OK, yeah, let me lay down, lay down on the table, because I couldn't even sit up. So they did some testing right away and discovered that that lump was actually Cellulitis and that it had, you know, turned into this horrific infection. So they were quite concerned about my condition. I had to get blood work right away, et cetera. And apparently they told my sister, we she is severely, severely ill and like if she probably should be hospitalized, she's very, very dehydrated, but we don't want to take the risk. Of putting her near any other infection. So we're going to see if we can get her home and get her a little hydrated and get her temperature down.

And this is a story about the time when I was kicking a ball in our yard and it went into our neighbors window. Our neighbor was a very intelligent young man by the name of Richard Jenkins. And Richard was a writer. And also a professor of literature, so. When I sent the ball crashing through his window I thought he was going to be mad and I was very reluctant to go fetch the ball but eventually I did and he said look I will. Let you go without any punishment if you write a short essay for me. And that is how I started writing. And I felt so much in love with writing that ever since I have become a writer and I haven't been published, but I have a lot of writings that started with that incident that Mister Jenkins induced.

To We were caught by a lockdown in her house and I did not attend school, but I did go to a tutors house because of course there were no schools. But one day I was getting ready to go to my tutors home. Who was doing supplementary work so that I wouldn't miss out on school that was cancelled? And it was raining. It was raining very hard. So I asked my Aunt Charlotte for an umbrella and she said, no, I'm not going to let you use my umbrella. So then I had to walk out in the rain without an umbrella and realized two things. One, that I was getting wet, which was not. Comfortable. I did not like that. And the second one, that I had a very good excuse to get a hold of umbrella. So I went back to my own Charlotte. I said look. I could get ill and who knows, I could get. I could catch Coronavirus. Because of getting ill. So the only way to prevent this is by you're lending me your umbrella. Is so phased with this incredible threat. Of course, even a mean old lady like a Charlotte was would not dare to deny me the umbrella. So she gave me the umbrella and I was able to walk to the tutor's house with the umbrella. Here is a picture.

We went right back in and saw an ER doctor immediately and of course they decided that it was too serious for them to deal with so they needed to call in a plastic surgeon to work on his face. However, there had been a car accident. Somewhere else. So the plastic. It had to be a pediatric plastic surgeon. My son was only 5 so those plastic surgeon was off somewhere else dealing with people from the car accident. So we just had to sit and wait. So we waited and we waited. Try entertaining A5 year old in a hospital bed for about 8 hours while we waited and. We played all kinds of video games. We looked at fish in a tank. We, I mean he got to the point he'd stopped bleeding. So we were just walking around and and of course we couldn't eat or drink anything. Well, he couldn't because they knew he was going to be going into surgery. So I of course his mom didn't need her drink anything because I didn't want him to see me doing it. And finally they came. The plastic surgeon came in and they decided he needed to go into surgery. It was about 2:00 AM and. We went into surgery with the doctor, one nurse and for some reason me, I went into surgery with them. And um. They got out this, this is all my son remembers. This huge long needle to to and it's just to seize his face. And when they got the needle out, he's of course started screaming because it was a very long needle. And I for some reason the doctor told me that I'm needed to be the one to hold my son down while he gave him the anesthesia. And so I held him down and they gave him the shot. And then I stood up. And since I hadn't eaten for 8-9 hours and I'm diabetic, I passed out on the floor of the operating room. And then they had two patients to deal with. And I it's strange, but they just brought me some orange juice and and had me stand up and continue to help with the surgery. So they gave him about I think 42 stitches and three layers underneath this nose, going from inside his nose down to his lip.

I was just like, this is where I always go. So I go in and I tell them in English. I've been in an accident. I am hurt. I need help now. And they hand me this form and tell me to fill it out.

So I have and you think I would know how to handle this by now, but you still forget. And one of the things I have to remember he just a little bit ago left back. He's still gone to the hardware store. And. I I think I would have not done before and make a list of what he was going for because he might forget and then he has to explain to the people there. Although he has had so much therapy that he can walk into a hardware store and draw pictures and use words and get across what he wants, and it's very rare there's a failure there. He draws a lot of little tiny pictures, but I've learned that to be sure, I it's hard to remember to verify all the time. And he doesn't give me an inkling that he doesn't comprehend, and maybe he thinks he comprehends. So how do you discern between those two things? That's quite difficult him. Does he think he understands perfectly, or does he not understand and doesn't really want to say he doesn't understand? So things like that make it. Very, very difficult. I do know if I write things down and show it to him, you can take it to the bank. He totally understands if he sees it written. I know not to ask him numbers out loud because he can't say numbers out loud. I did find out in the last week that he can repeat. Thanks to you. And that is something he has never been able to repeat. Not even one word. And Apple seems to be repeating with no effort. So I don't think he could tell me what I missed on a program, but he can repeat a word if you ask him to repeat the word. It's very difficult socially. It's such an isolating disability that's. I I've wondered if it's different with a woman than it is with a man. Because women are more other women are more caring, more empathetic, less frightened. And I think men are not in general, so there is this learning curve for men. They they they have this discomfort and so it's just easier to avoid. And I always feel badly for him.

That there was a woman and she had two daughters and a man who had a daughter and Cinderella ended up in this home with two step sisters. And they were unpleasant to her because she. Always seem to make everything look happy and bright. Even animals cheered up when they were around her because she just let off this gift of light and love. And and the sisters were very jealous and the stepmother was very jealous also. So they mistreated Cinderella and had her do terrible things that none of them wanted to do. So Cinderella would gaze outside and look at the castle and wonder about what life was like outside of the walls she lived in. And. The castle there was a a family obviously who lived there and the Prince was looking to find. Love and get married and decided to have a big ball and have all everyone in the entire village come to this ball. So Cinderella's step sisters. Got all of their, you know, their lovely items together and their dresses and their hair and all of these things. And Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball and. Since her stepmother and her step sisters didn't help her, all of the animals did. So the the animals who loved Cinderella because she was so good put together a beautiful gown for her. And just as Cinderella thought she was going to get out of the house, her step sisters and her stepmother ruined her gown. And she was very, very sad. And the step sisters went off to the ball and Cinderella was left with, you know, ripped up dress and and nothing to do. So this fairy godmother showed up and said, Cinderella, you are such a nice person, you're such a good person and you have so much love to give and you have so much light. I really want you to go to the ball, so I'm going to create a horse and carriage and. A new outfit for you and it's going to be so lovely, but it ends at midnight so you have to make sure you come home before then. So Cinderella goes to the ball and her step sisters were not pleased because everyone stared at Cinderella when she came in, because she was just so beautiful. And the Prince, of course noticed her beauty and grace and. Again, this kind of calm light. Soothing to people that she let off and he danced with her and. Just then she realized it was almost midnight, and so she ran out. She lost one of her shoes, and she didn't even make it home when everything went back the way that it was. And then? One of the people who worked at the castle came around with the slipper that was found at the ball and tried it on every woman in town. And it fits Cinderella.

Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed about three months after I retired in 2011. I had symptoms before then but didn't connect the dots. I had night sweats. I was tired. And. You just didn't think much of it. But then I noticed that I was losing weight, and that's what caused me to seek a doctor. So I went to I hadn't been to a doctor in years. So I ended up going to the physician that my wife Marie uses. She's now both our physician for both of us. She did an office exam and. Was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram because she palpated and she felt something that lymph nodes turned out. So I went for a sonogram. And that was positive enough for me to have a CAT scan and a PET scan. That led to the need for a biopsy, so at that, by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong. Uh, the decision was going to be, is it it? It was lymphoma. But is it going to be Hodgkin's lymphoma? Or non Hodgkin's lymphoma. So I went to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy. But that wasn't enough. That not enough tissue was obtained, so I had to go into the city, into New York. To Sloan for a more complete biopsy and that clinched it. It was Hodgkin's lymphoma. Which, in the great scheme of things was the better of the two. Hodgkins is much more treatable. Higher success rate. So I started chemo. And uh. After the first session. I developed a rash. And we weren't quite sure what was going on. One of the nurses, the the oncologist, wasn't sure. And he was going to proceed with the treatment for the for the Hodgkins. But one of his nurses said this is an allergic reaction. And it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to allopurinol. I think I mentioned this last time, which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney. It's actually a drug for gout, but it has the protective effect for kidney function. That landed me in the hospital with with what's called Steven Johnson Syndrome. Which is treated like a burn. People with Stevens Johnson are often sent to burn units. My mouth was inflamed, but it was just off. I couldn't drink water. It just it burned. Yeah, of course. Suspended chemo. We worked through the Stevens Johnson. I was looking forward to chemo. It was it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation. So. And I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather. But still I I couldn't take solid food for for two weeks or so, nor water it was. It was the only thing that really worked was was. Iced tea? Um. So I got through this season. Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months. It ended.

Usually I can. Much faster. Thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad, or from any time from when you were a kid to more recently. It was February 1978. It had been snowing all day, and in fact that was the year when we had the Blizzard of 1978. And we had received a whole lot of snow that winter. So at noon on this day in February when my husband came home from work. Where he had been working at his job as a pastoral counselor at Second Presbyterian Church, he said, Carla, come in the house. I want to tell you something. I want to ask you something. So I said OK. So I followed him in, taking off boots and coats and scarves and mittens. He said sit down for a minute. So I said, OK, I'm sitting, what do you have to ask me? How would you like to go and live in Kenya for three years? Kenya, I said. Where's Kenya? He said. It's on the equator, where it's hot, no snow. I said count me in, Let's go. And so we did. He had received an invitation to come and work with the National Christian Council of Kenya and a Family Life education program, where he would be responsible for setting up a counseling center in Nairobi. And eventually I got involved in community health in the same organization. But yes, that would be fun. Let's do it. And the so four months later. We had sold our house, our car, most of our household possessions. With the exception of a few that were stored by a friend. And our family of four, my husband Ted, our two daughters Michelle aged 9 and Cindy aged 5 and I got on an airplane and we flew to Akron, PA because we were doing this even though we are Lutheran and background and he is a Lutheran pastor. We were invited to do this through a Mennonite mission program. Who are the Mennonites? We don't know. So we were invited to attend day orientation. Period. In the heart of Mennonite country in Akron, PA. Where we spent 10 marvelous days getting to know. The Mennonites and also a group of other people who were about to embark on Mennonite sponsored mission programs. And the name of the organization was the Mennonite Central Committee. So that began a three-year period of high adventure for our family, one of the best times in our lives. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see.

And and I said something about, you know, kind of describing, she was asking. So I was describing a little bit of what I was experiencing that day. And she said, Sally, you're having a baby today. And I said, no, I'm not because I didn't even, you know, there wasn't even close to being what they had described in all of the labor classes and whatnot. And so I kept saying no, no, no, no, no. And she said, yeah, you're having a baby today. So. And that was really like late afternoon when that happened, and by about 6:00 I think it was. I started feeling more stuff happening. And still I didn't think we needed there was any big deal. I, you know, it wasn't like enough. And I think we must have arrived at the hospital by, umm, by by 7:30-ish. It was like, OK, yeah, this is real. It's it's time. And so I'm on the way to the hospital and my husband, I think this is my first child and again, kind of confused. Anyway, he's of course. You know like nobody goes you're gonna maybe not right now and and and so of course I was having contractions in the car and one point he was speeding like he was speeding and and he barely would stop for the lights and we all continue to laugh because my words were I I yelled at him to slow down and said it's not about you it's about me. And I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous, but he and I just always laugh at that. Still, to this day, it's not about you, It's about me. Which was a stupid thing to say. But you know who's rational at that point? So we got to the hospital, and she was born at about 11:00. 35I boy, what kind of a mom am. I even remember somewhere after 11:30, because I remember when she was born then that I was thinking about what date it was, it was the 14th, and that somebody had hoped that if I'd had it on the 15th that would be on their birthday. And I had, you know, missed that window. But anyway, so it, you know, of course that's incredible when you hold. Your first child in your arms for the first time. But I was exceedingly grateful that it was a relatively quick delivery and and you know, that's not to say it didn't hurt Ashley, that's not to say it didn't hurt but it was a, you know, a great experience All in all and and then we had our first baby. Wild. Now she's 22. Is that enough? Also, tell a story, take a second to look at them, and then, when you're ready, please tell me a story about them with the beginning, a middle and an end. Once there was a boy. Named Sam. Sam loved to play soccer, but it was during. The Coronavirus Pandemic. So Sam could not play soccer with his soccer team. The best he could do was to go outside by himself and kick his soccer ball around. He kicked and kicked and kicked and eventually he accidentally kicked his soccer ball so hard that it went right into the window of his neighbors house. His neighbor was an adult man named. Ohh, Ferdinand."}, {"segment_name": "richardson196_32523_269170.wav", "azure_transcription": "Uh, so Jonathan was playing with his soccer ball outside. It was a pretty sunny day.

And so his soccer ball went through the glass window of his neighbor, Mr. Willis, who is in the middle of watching TV, just relaxing. And the soccer ball lands right in his lap, so there was no escaping bat. So then he picks up the ball and looks outside and sees Jonathan, who is then running away because he. Realizes that he made a terrible mistake against Mr. Bullis. OK, excellent. So we're going to do the same thing with another one. So take a look at these pictures and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So. James is on his way to school. He walks to school everyday and his mom said, you know James, you should take your umbrella. I really think you should take your umbrella. Supposed to rain today. And James was like, no mom, it's sunny right now. It's going to be fine. I'm not going to take the umbrella. He probably wouldn't say what vernacular because he's like 7, but he goes outside, it starts raining and he's like, ohh no ohh no, I don't have my umbrella. My mom was so right. So he runs home in the rain and gets. All wet, all his books get wet and his backpack. He gets home and his mom is less than pleased with him because he's dragged his his wet shoes and self into the house and she's looking very sternly at him. And so now James is always sure to pack his umbrella because he does not want to get in trouble again. OK, good. OK, we'll do the same thing with this one. This is a little bit different. It's kind of a seam. So take a look at the entire picture and then you can tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.  So. A man. Phillip was walking on the street and he. Gets a little startled by this this growling dog that had jumped the fence of you know a house in the neighbourhood. This dog had jumped the fence and was very ferocious. So the man got scared and switched his pace from walking to a full on Sprint. And in the in the way of how fighter flight works he climbs up a tree and gets in a branch so as the so to get away from the dog. And meanwhile, this cat was also startled. This is just a little feral cat that goes around in the neighborhood, and the cat also got startled because of this dog, and so it climbed up the tree. Now this little girl's riding her her tricycle and sees this cute little cat, and so she's trying to coax it down from the tree. Meanwhile, another another fellow Walker on the street saw what the whole scene was going, what was happening, and how there's. Not only this cat stuck in the tree, but also a man stuck in the tree who's afraid to get down.

The stepmother and the two daughters. And there's a gentleman in the next picture with a little girl who is Cinderella, who is cursing and all pleasant, and they obviously aren't.

They this sisters and mother treat Cinderella like she's a servant and they're very unkind to her and she as a result she makes friends with the animals. And. Down the road, the stepmother gets a letter inviting everyone to a ball at the castle. Because the Princess father, the king thinks it's time for him to find a wife and everyone is invited. And the girls are all very excited, and Cinderella thinks she's included. So she there's a picture of her reading a book from a trunk and the only thing I can think that is is perhaps a pattern on how to make a dress or instructions. So she's gathered whatever scraps she can find in her little attic bedroom and mix with the help of the mice, they make a dress. And. She gets ready the night of the ball to go. And is told that this was not for her, she's not allowed to go. And as I recall, they rip her dress to shreds and they go on to the ball and she kind of goes back to her. Ohh lofty place. The next thing we see is. We've got the mice and the animals around being empathetic, and then her fairy godmother appears. And very godmother whipped her up a beautiful white gown and a pumpkin carriage. I can't remember why the horses are rearing up, but something scared the horses and that was before this. So anyway, the pumpkin carriage is all good. She gets in the carriage. The fairy godmother tells her that she has to be back by midnight or it all goes away. So she goes to the ball. The stepmother and sisters are at Howard to see her and not happy at all. And the Princess enchanted and they spend the evening dancing and all of a sudden she hears the clock almost chiming to midnight and she takes off running and going down the stairs. She loses one of the glass slippers provided by the. The fairy godmother and the Prince finds that. And she gets home. And umm. She look. She's sitting with the animals, looking at the glass flicker with good memories. So now the Prince still has a glass slipper and he sends everyone out looking for the the girl with the glass other glass slipper and what they hear about this the stepmother and step sisters. They realized it was her and they don't want him to know, so they lock her in her room. However, the little animals, the mice especially, bring a key to get her to unlock the door so she can come down and be found to try on the slipper and that is what happened. She goes downstairs, tries on the glass slipper. The Prince realizes he's found his bride and. That's not the end of the stepmother and step sisters. And the last we see as they're they're getting married, living happily ever after. Beautifully. I would like you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. OK, the best peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. This made with white bread. Totally unhealthy, but it's so good.

By the way, I'm not clear at all where the father was during all this. He apparently traveled a lot, and so he was gone. The So anyway, the the woman introduced herself to Cinderella, telling her that she was her fairy godmother and she was there to grant her wishes. Well, Cinderella was taken aback, quite quite thrilled at this whole possibility. And so the fairy godmother said you will go to the ball. And. She. I think the very first thing she did was to to create a beautiful ball gown for Cinderella and her beautiful hairdo and lovely tiara type thing to put in her hair and. Beautiful slippers to put on her feet, which were very unusually made out of glass. But Cinderella said, how can I get to the ball? The carriage is gone. I can't walk, especially not in glass slippers. And so the fairy godmother worked her magic and created a carriage out of a pumpkin, created a coachman and. Other servants out of the mice and I think made the rats into horses. So anyway, there they were, all set ready to go to the ball. So she left, Cinderella, left in her all her finery and went to the ball, walked in. And the whole place came to hush. Everybody's looking at her and thinking, who is that beautiful young woman? And of course, guess who was the most impressed was the Prince. So he immediately asked her to dance. And after they had one dance he was really not interested in. Anybody else? So they had a lovely time. Suddenly, though, Cinderella remembered the most important thing that the fairy godmother had told her which was. At the. Stroke of midnight, she had to leave the ball because if by the end of 12 bell strikes. She was still there. Everyone would see that she was really dressed in rags and all of her servants were.

And my son had to go into a special care nursery, so he wasn't in my room with me and they had to wheel me in a wheelchair down to the special care nursery so that I could nurse him.

OK, well, I am the associate director of the Aphasia Lab at the University of South Carolina, so I work with people with Aphasia every day and have been a speech pathologist for over 30 years. So I guess you could say I deal with people with communication issues every day for my last 30 years of of my working life. And what I find interesting is finding ways to reach people. Who are cognitively intact but yet are not able to express themselves. So I'm always very interested in figuring out how to reach people who are basically trapped in in their bodies and not being able to communicate the way that they want to. So have just always been really interested in ways to improve. And of course for the last four years is when I've been at the aphasia lab, so we've focused on aphasia and being able to. Number one, help them increase or improve verbal communication. But also I teach the Adult Language Disorders course here at University of South Carolina as well, and finding ways to use augmentative and alternative communication, supported conversation with family members, and just trying to improve in general people's ability to communicate, no matter what their verbal communication is like, and no matter what their cognitive skills are either. I have done research both with. People with stroke, but also with brain injuries. So I've worked with people with lots of different levels of cognitive and language disorders. So just I guess maximizing as much as we can ways for people to express themselves. Tell me a story about something that happened to you in your life. It could be happy, It could be sad. It could be from when you were child. It could be from more recently. I guess it could be so. I have two children and one of my children is adopted and one is not.

She goes in this grand style to the ball and of course the Prince likes her the best and dances with her the most. And then she's got to leave suddenly at noon, at midnight, because her fairy godmother said, you can have all this, but it's only good until midnight. And then be home by then.

She needed a beautiful gown. She turned the pumpkin into a coach. They changed the mice into horses. And everybody participated.

The Prince wanted to find out who it was that was at the ball, since no one knew who Cinderella was. And he decided to go on a search for the love of his life. Um, by having all the girls in the Kingdom try on the glass slipper. And he searched and he searched. And then he finally stopped at the. The house where Cinderella and her family lived, and they tried the slippers on the sisters who each of the girls tried to shove their feet in them, but they didn't fit. And then they whined.

He had a different position by then, but he was doing an audit of a gasoline station and we owned some gift shops that I managed and I had come home early because my daughter was ill and school had said come pick her up. I brought her home, fed her, I just sent her up to bed. She didn't feel well and my phone rang. And it was one of the people who worked for my husband as a young man in his 30s. And he he says and. You know, I'm, I'm here with your husband and I know he hasn't been feeling well, but this goes on and on and he's but he's on the floor.

I said, well here's what I want you to do. I want you to first call 911 and tell them to get there and when they do, call me back, I said. And in the meantime, I want you to go out in the front of the store and see if anyone there knows how to do CPR in case we need it. So he did that and he came back. He says, well, one guy says he saw it done on TV. I'm going, Well it's not real helpful, but OK, he says. But I can hear the sirens right now. I said, that's good, that's good. I said OK, I'll stay on with you. When when they get there, let me talk to them and I'll tell them what's happening and what he's taken and what his history is.

The sun was not yet married and didn't haven't really found anybody that he was interested in marrying and so the king decided to have a ball to introduce his son to all the ladies in the land so that he can find someone to marry because the king was very anxious for his son to be Mary.

And the interesting thing about that was that my mom was real bright, real intelligent, and she would tell herself and me stories about why she didn't know something. She would read in the paper that somebody had died. And then? Talk about it and then later do the same thing. And then she would say ohh. I must have not read the paper before, and I didn't, and so I didn't know what she would. She would make up reasons, logical, logical reasons why she hadn't known something. She also got really good at asking questions instead of asking, you know, making making, asking other people to talk instead of having them ask her questions because she knew she wasn't able to answer questions. I. So. I think. I'm not sure, but I think. That this was some reading that I had done. Which said that. With a person with that sort of memory loss. There is absolutely no point in trying to help them to remember or or or make them or for heaven's sake, make them feel bad about not remembering things. Because of course, for there's a period of time in there. When you. When you realize when my mother was realizing that she was. Losing. Memory and and it was horrible for her, she felt. Awful. And. And of course, after a while, it's bad enough that she doesn't remember anymore, and that's really better. At least it didn't hurt her so much. And I also did a lot of thinking at that point about what? Experience means. Experiencing things mean when you means when you can't remember them. Like we would go to plays and musicals and concerts. And this was when she was living with my aunt and I would go over once a month and we would usually do something like that. Not movies, really, but but musical things, Concerts and and musicals, Musical theater. Mom would have no memory whatsoever of that the next day, but. She loved it while it was happening, just was delighted. She was always musical and these this kind of stuff just put pleased her no end And so I had it was really interesting to think about what. She what it means, what that means. Is it valuable? How valuable is it when you don't remember it? And I decided ultimately it was really valuable."}, {"segment_name": "wright80a_629080_864525.wav", "azure_transcription": "Ohh God. Umm.

I was running with Heidi and just chasing her in my left foot. Bent, I heard it crack and it made a snapping sound and I knew that was not a good thing to hear, so I went down on the ground. I sat down immediately and got off my foot. I don't remember where Heidi went. The dog's name was Heidi and she was there. But I went, I got up the stairs because it was the yard stairs, went into the backyard going down the stairs. So I had to go up the stairs that my husband build this porch. It was a patio porch and with stairs and we would sit out there and have our barbecue and that, so. I cleaned up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kind of dragging it. I would not step on the other foot that was broken. So we got upstairs and went onto the couch and I laid down. And I it was. Wasn't hurting. And when my middle son came home from school, he said, what happened to you? And I said, well, I think I broke my foot because I heard this snappy noise while I was playing with Heidi. He said, well, you have better get to the hospital. And I said, Oh no, I'm OK. I don't have to go to the hospital. He said, Oh yes you do. He must have been in about fifth grade. So you have to go to the hospital. No. What? No, I don't. And he said, well, I'm going next door to. Talked to Steve. His wife is a nurse. So he went and he told Steve and Steve told his wife, the nurse what happened. Since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do, he ran off to find out some other advice. So the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor. So. Then I called my husband and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious. The nurse would know what to do, not me or not my son. But obviously he didn't know what to do. So when I went to the doctor he they X-rayed my foot. I had broken my 5th metatarsal.

They enjoyed some some time together and and became attracted to one another and enjoyed each other's company during the course of the ball.

Recognize her daughters and and and everything.

See, other than being having babies and done any kidney, I did have numerous colds and ear infections when I was young. So about 5 when I was about five years old, it was determined that they were going to take my tonsils out. So they kind of told me what was going to be about and that I would have a scratchy throat. And I couldn't remember everything because I was five years old. But I do remember waking up and my mom was there and she was so comforting to me very. Difficult to swallow so my my throat was swollen and it hurt. And this is a lot for a 5 year old and my parents brought my Ken and Barbie doll and little dollhouse. I can play with that while I was in the hospital bed and remember them bringing me lime Sherbert and it was so good on my throat. Leo's in the hospital about two days and the recovery was was fairly easy. Took me a while, maybe about four or five days before I could actually eat something that was truly solid. But that really did help with the colds because I didn't hardly have any colds at all. So there you go. Easy peasy. Before we give you the actual prompt, have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? And we keep that pretty broad. Any difficulty communicating? OK. So then what I'd like is if you could tell me what the issues or problems are or were as well as what you do about those issues. OK. Well. Um, let's see. It was probably about six years ago. My best friend, her name is Sonny. We used to work together. And her husband, Steven. Tall guy, nice, nice looking man. He started doing weird things, like he left his glasses up in a tree. I'm like. And then he was forgetting things. And then it actually got worse and worse. So about two years ago, she took him, Steven, to the Doctor. They end up doing an Alzheimer's test on him. And sure enough, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. And watching Steven go downhill. It's been so sad and and to this day he's still going downhill and he's only. 59 years old. When I do see him, he now talks and two word sentences, maybe 3. Or you'll ask him a question and he just kind of looks at you, and sometimes you have to do your hands or kind of visualize something for him for him to understand. Umm. I think he's on medicine. That doesn't help very much. So when I'm there talking to him and I don't go there very often, I haven't been there since the the virus, but I kind of just hug him and I just look in his eyes and just tell him hi. Steven, it's so good to see you and you'll say good to see you too. He doesn't remember my name. He remembers Sonny's name, but he knows that he knows me. But as far as what I would do to help him talk, I there's not a whole lot I can do because. His conversation skills are are gone. They're just gone. But keeping it really simple for him, maybe ask a question that's maybe real easy for him to answer that doesn't involve memory, like how you feeling today or you know I like your pants Steven, something like that. So that's that's about all I know that I could do to help him is just keep it really simple."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL28-2_109377_344583.wav", "azure_transcription": "I'm curious. It was it was only like a week really that it was like. They wanted me to stay down. I think I actually took like 10 days and just. Chilled out. But that's not me. So sitting doesn't Sydney doesn't do well for me. Have you had any experience with someone who has a difficult time communicating? And this can be any kind of difficulty communicating. We keep it kind of broad. But what I was hoping is that you could tell me what kinds of difficulties there were, what kinds of issues and also what you did about it. Umm, I guess just learning as my mom gets older. That her. Hearing is not as good and I obviously. Have a little bit of an issue speaking up. And I forget that she can't hear me. And and we've tried different. You know, my brothers tried like different. Hearing aids for her to see if that helps and you know, you know, buying the headless speakers and so on and stuff like that. It really doesn't help. So now I'm just really practicing trying to look at her when I talk, which is become a challenge where if you have a face mask on. But looking at her and remembering. That she can't hear me because I don't always think about it because I've known my, you know, my mom's never been hard of hearing and now she has hard time hearing. They just have to remember to speak up. And often I don't remember that until I see it, until I see her looking at me going. What are you saying? So we're working on that one still. I would like you to tell me. Thinking back, can you think of a story about an important event in your life? Something that happened to you could be happy or sad from your childhood to up to now. Just any important event that you could tell me a story about. The day my granddaughter was born. My husband and myself live in Florida. And our son and daughter-in-law lived, did not live in Ohio. And what happened? Know that her. Um due date was January 1st and we wouldn't be able to make it, so we went up early for Christmas. And. We visited with. We were going to go visit them, but we stopped in. Cleveland 1st and my Where my father-in-law lives, and my daughter and son-in-law, my son and daughter-in-law live in Columbus. So we were at my father in laws and my daughter had also flown in from Florida to just got there the night before and we stayed up really late. And then we woke up in the morning and we were going to go do stuff and we got a call that said her water broke. And. That the baby was coming. So we jumped in the car, drove 2 1/2 hours to Columbus and made it there before the baby was born, just waiting in the waiting room with her mother. And her stepfather. And then getting the text that the baby was born and that they'd be out in a little bit. So it was a very exciting day. We got to go through the baby. We got to actually be there when she was born instead of back home when we couldn't be off. So once again, I'd like to show you these pictures, take a little time and look at each one, and then please tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end.

They tried to fit their feet into the slippers, but it was too small and it was too delicate. Flinging it around between the two of them, the man decided that they were certainly not the woman.

That's that being close to 3000 miles once we were back from that trip including including Orlando Grids Lab in Tennessee and. And it was strange gradually getting more emotion. And. Gradually getting more strength back than. It was the odd experience. Well, thank you for sharing. Now, can you tell me of an experience that you've had with someone who has had a difficult time communicating? Interesting question. Well, the only. The only experiences of vets sort of thing. We're most recently in 2018. In 2000. 18. 1st in February. My mother-in-law, who at that point was living at a care center in Bloomington. Gradually. Loss. The ability to. To communicate very well because of. Health problems are just reaching a. The point where she. Wasn't conscious a lot of the time and when she was, wasn't communicating very well and. And she died in February of that year. And then. My father-in-law in Gainesville, FL. We. Were there in January and he was doing pretty well but in March he was in the hospital and but. Communicating fairly well but having some issues and. But it was much improved when we came back here. But then he had a downturn and died in April and then when we were in Philadelphia in May. Of that year, my mother had some serious. Decline in Health and. When the whole family was at her room in intensive care in Philadelphia. Through her times when you could talk to her and she would notice, and other times that she didn't, and then sometimes she'd be talkative and make sense and other times not."}, {"segment_name": "wright61a_45531_280088.wav", "azure_transcription": "OK, the little girls pet cat. Slimed very high into a tree and she was so upset she she had been cycling around and and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree and she called her father. To climb the tree to help to get the cat down. The dog was barking at the base of the tree. The mother in Benin, meantime, had obviously called the fire brigade to get Dad down out of the tree. And. That's the end of the story as I see it. And we were living in LA and we lost our house in an earthquake and at which time we decided to move to Arizona and shortly after we arrived in Arizona, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me because I knew no one here. I had no friends. And luckily I had a wonderful Doctor Who performed an operation on me and put me on a drug which I had to take called Tamoxifen. I live in the lakes in Tempe, which is a very pleasant place to live, and over the years, over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication, I got to know very many friends who were extremely good, very supportive to me and I feel very grateful to my friends. For the support that I got at that time, and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been 11 years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer and up till now Touchwood, there is no recurrence of it. I could remember when I first I worked for the BBC I was. I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney, Australia, and when I left with my German husband when I left Australia to come back to Germany, my, my. My German. My gift of the German language was not very large and um. I already had one child who was born in Australia, and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home and I had to do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could. Which wasn't very easy because I had a sister-in-law who was not very kind at that time, and every time I made a mistake in Germany, she used to. She used to laugh and make fun of me, and I used to be very resentful about that, but because I was, I guess, so ambitious at that time. And because I was good at dialects and I I think this has something to do with musical ability, because I'm able to hear how a language sounds. I learned I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year. I would say that's that's all I could say about language structures. Very much so. Um. I was four years old when the Second World War started and I was living in Cardiff that time, which is the capital of Wales. And we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit and my parents had decided to send me to stay to live with my grandparents who lived closer to the coast in Wales. And about two days before I was due to depart to to live with my grandparents, our house was flattened. Luckily we were in the garden at that time in what they call an Anderson shelter. And we we heard obviously what was going on outside."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL5-1_1096361_1330918.wav", "azure_transcription": "Once Upon a time there was a woman who had two daughters. She married a man who had a daughter of his own.

So in fact they made her do all the work and all of the chores. This other girl the new, the daughter of the husband. Her name was Cinderella and they made her do lots and lots of work. She was very, very kind, however, to the animals because they were really the only friends she had. Well, Cinderella looked out the window one day where she saw the palace. And what was happening in the palace at the time was that the Prince was was time for the Prince to be married. And so his father was saying that that they he needed to decide who he was going to marry. So they decided to have a ball where they would invite all the young ladies from the town or the village. So an invitation went out to Cinderella's family. Her stepmother received the invitation and her stepmother told her daughters about it, who got very excited. But they didn't really say anything to Cinderella. And the daughter started preparing their dresses and getting things ready for the ball that they were not going to give a dress to Cinderella. So she went into her treasure chest. She opened up a book and had some old fabric in it. And she looked at that and and. Decided to make herself addressed for the ball. But then when the time came for the sisters to all go to the ball, they said, oh, you need to fix my dress and you need to fix my dress. And they ripped things from Cinderella's dress to use on theirs and before long she had nothing to wear to the ball and they were not going to have her go with them. So off the sisters went. Cinderella was so sad she went out into the garden. And there she saw happen to see a pumpkin and and the mice, and pretty soon a fairy godmother appeared. And the fairy godmother said to Cinderella some magical words, and she turned the pumpkin into a carriage. She turned the mice into horsemen or something, or horses, and she turned Cinderella, ripped up clothes into a beautiful gown. Cinderella. Went to the ball, but the fairy godmother said you must leave by midnight because then the the coach will become a pumpkin and your dress will turn back to rags. The Cinderella walked into the ball and the Prince and she began to dance. But at midnight, the clock struck and she knew she had to leave. So she ran out of the council. She ran down the steps, and when she did, she ran right out of one of her glass slippers. She ran and ran into the fields until indeed, her dress returned to rags. And the coach turned back into a pumpkin. And one of the mice had a key for some oh, I know, because I guess they locked her up or something and can't remember why what was going on in that picture. But they had the mice unlocked the key. Oh yeah, because the Prince was coming to to see whose foot fit that glass slipper. Because he knew that was the woman he wanted to marry. And when he arrived at the house, he tried the shoe. They tried the shoe on the two sisters and it didn't fit. The Cinderella was locked up, but the mice found the key unlocked. Cinderella's room, so she came running down. She tried on the slipper. It fit. And then the Prince knew that she was the one he wanted to marry.

That help me communicate with this person. One is don't ask questions. Because they don't like questions. And the other is to get them at the right time of day. Umm. Or a good or if he calls me. He he usually will have something to say. But if I really feel like I need to talk to him, I know not to call him in the morning, you know and and I know to hang up if he's.

One day her dad decided that she he needed to get married again so that she would have a mother. So he met and he married a widow that had two small girls of her own. And all things seemed good.

All how I never thought how complicated it was to do that and and all that goes into that. And it was a long process and probably took close to a year. We went through a domestic adoption agency here in South Carolina and actually had a couple birth mothers lined up who changed their minds at the last minute. So that was kind of heartbreaking at the time and then finally. Adopted my daughter when she was about two months old. So, you know, we always say we were just waiting for her and and of course she always tells her brother that she was the chosen one because we chose her and we didn't have any choice with him. He's just what we got. So, you know, I think it made me appreciate being a mom from two different because I gave birth to a child and also I adopted a child. I think it gave me. Interesting insight to both sides of it, and there's certainly pros and cons to both ways to becoming a mom as well, but. You know, a lot of people say ohh, we can never adopt. It wouldn't feel like my own child. Yeah, she's my child, just like my son is. There's no difference between them. So. And she and she's interesting too, because she says that she wants to adopt when she's ready to start a family, that she would like to adopt A child from the foster system. So I think that's kind of interesting, her perspective on that. All right. Same idea here. Take a look at these pictures. They also tell a story. I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. Little boy was playing soccer in his yard and one time he kicked it a little bit too hard and he kicked it through his front window. His dad was sitting in the living room and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp. The dad stood up, got the ball and looked out the window and glared at his little boy. These pictures tell story. Take a look at all of them and then I'll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle and an end. And you can look at the pictures as you tell the story. So the little boy was getting ready to go to school and his mother said, Johnny, you need to take an umbrella. It's going to rain today. And he said, mom, it's not raining, I don't need an umbrella. And he left. And sure enough, as he got halfway to school, it started raining. And then it started raining harder. So he turned around and he went back home and he told his mom, you were right, it started raining and she was not very happy with him. And so he ended up taking the umbrella and walking back to school. So I just want you to look at everything that's happening in this store in this picture, and then tell me a story about what you see. Ideally a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. OK. So the little girl was riding along on her tricycle in her yard and she was playing with her cat and her dog and all of a sudden the dog chased the cat up the tree. And so she was very upset and she called for her dad and she said dad. Sparky has chased. Peanut up the tree. And so the dad said, well, let me see if I can go get the cat. So Sparky still barking at the trunk of the base of the tree. Dad climbed up the tree, but he couldn't reach the cat.

It's nice and crunchy on top. It's very soft on the interior. You take your peanut butter crunchy and some and regular. You mix those together. You put it on the peanut. You put on the peanut butter on the sandwich. You take the Jelly. Uh, I wouldn't use grape Jelly. But uh, you can use other kinds of Jelly. And I I like strawberry sometimes. I mix the strawberry and the great together. I put it on there, and then I take that sandwich and I put it in the microwave and I heat it so that the peanut butter, Jelly, and the bread all soak them together. I still have crunchy on the top, but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm, and then I eat that. Uh. Four years ago. I uh uh. Had my knees replaced. Uh, I had them both done at the same time.

All right, I haven't had a stroke, but I did have a couple stents. Done two years ago, this past February. And I smoked up until that time, up until about two days before then. It was February the 9th or 10th. And. The surgery was on a Wednesday and there the procedure and Monday I ran out of cigarettes. I had one Sunday morning and I thought, hey, go ahead. I don't want. I'm not going to do any smoking. They're going to make me stop anyway once I get in the hospital, so. So I didn't. I had that last one Monday morning and I haven't smoked since then. But getting back to my story Wednesday at 1:00 AM. I've already been to the doctor. He had done a stress test and he. Said that we needed to. Look at you more closely and. What they do is they they put you somewhat under and they go up through your groin with the camera. Then take a good look at your heart. And. So I was sort of out of it, but I do remember it, and I remember the doctor's name was Richard. Richard, you can't think of the last name, but they called him. Rapid Richard. Because he was so quick and he went out and I says I must have woke up. I said, well Doc, are you there? He says Yep, I'm there. I said, how's it look? He says. Well we're going to have a couple stents put in and there's some got some problems. Ohh, gosh, that's alright. Must have gone back out little bit later on, I said. What are you doing, Doc? Are you about to Adam? He says. Just finishing up. We should be done here in just a few minutes. Then I went back to sleep and. I don't remember them rolling me back to my room. Or getting in my bed.

That's probably, like, the singular event that's most significant. Yeah. OK, I'll tell you a story. This is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird, but it's so clear in my mind and I still don't still making sense. So my first semester of my first two years of college, I went to the University of Iowa and Iowa City, but my family's from DC and I had a car. So I would drive back and forth over break time with my car and it's about 1000 miles, so it generally takes about two days. So the first semester back, it's winter. I am driving across I-80, which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with a lot of corn. So it is an extremely boring, repetitive Dr. There's a lot of, you know, driver tunnel vision that happens and it's cold and Gray, so it's not even pretty Greenfield. It's just empty, empty, empty fields. But I'm, I'm kind of proud of myself because it's my first semester went well. I was, you know, independent, excited. So I'm on I-80 in sort of the middle of Illinois. And there's a slowdown and it's very flat, so I can see a hat. I don't see that there's construction. I don't really see an accident. But I, you know, figure something's happened, probably in minor accident. Looks like it's a rubbernecking delay. It's kind of ******* me off I-80 at this point. It's only two lanes in each direction. And there's like no exits, nothing built along it. And we get closer and closer and closer and I still cannot see what's going on. I'm just like what? Look this be. And we get a little closer. I see, OK, it looks like I'm, I'm in the left lane and then there's a medium between the, you know, eastbound and westbound routes and I'm going east. And I can see that there's something over in the median to my left, and it looks as I get closer like an animal, and I get closer and it looks like a fairly large animal. And I'm thinking. Is it a cow? Is it? A moose, I mean, I mean that's there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois, but it looks, it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it, so. A little bit more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay, but I'm still kind of internally rolling my eyes, going. Why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal wasting my time? I just want to get home. And I get closer and I can see that there's. Kind of large hind legs. So it's oriented where basically it looks like the **** of the animal is basically facing the car. There's kind of a long tail and it's brown and it's this big hump. Oh my God. And I get I'm getting closer and closer and closer and I, you know, my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern magic thing. What is this thing? I don't it's not a cow. It's not a dear. It's too big to be a dog and I'm literally as I'm passing it. Like my head is to, you know, we're just creeping along. My head is sort of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view and it's only till it's like. At my shoulder and I passed it that it my mind kind of pattern matches and goes. It's a kangaroo. You know, again, I have to turn around and look at the road and everything's cleared up behind me and I felt like the next 5 miles going, no, there's no way the kangaroo and then go. But it wasn't anything else. It was a kangaroo with Clear Lake kangaroo. I saw the ears, I saw the big massive tail, I saw the big hind legs, I saw little tiny front legs. It was a canker and so to this day, it's this thing where I just don't know. I just don't. I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo and I've even. I mean, this was.

And the reason she departed in such a hurry was that one of the stipulations the fairy godmother had given was that she would need to be home by midnight, or else the. The spell would wear off. And her true identity would be revealed. So for days afterwards, Cinderella was reveling in the joy of this experience.

Early when I had the initial operation, that was before the days of scopes, arthroscopes. So my first one was what I call slice and dice. They cut it and did the took the pieces out. The next two were. Scopes and in those the the way the scope went the second one. They were able to get some additional pieces that had fallen out. The third one, they were looking around at the knee and I remember distinctly the Doctor saying, oh, what was that? And he moved the scope a little bit and saw a piece of. Meniscus floating by the scope and he says ohh. We must have missed this on this on the last surgery, so that was that. So after that I was still relatively young, but it got to the point where I started getting pains. Once I was 55 ish, started getting pain. I went to an orthopedic surgeon. He worked with me for several years, did injections, trying to take care of. Uh, moving the knee so it would be OK And eventually those lubrications did not work, so that's when they went in for the total knee replacement. Since then, I've had lots of fun. I've actually been back to a different surgeon because we found out through going to a different surgeon. To that, the appliance that they used and my knee. Was. One version and the guy that I went to said wonder why they used that one and what they found was my PCL which holds one part of my knee to the other part of my knee. Was basically he used the word mangled so it had been stretched out and twisted so much that my knee would pop out of place. Umm. And he gave me two options. One was. Surgery and Med changed the appliance that had to do the full another total knee replacement and put in the new appliance. Or go rehab. So I did rehab. I actually did a unique kind of rehab. I use a personal trainer and they were able to send him the information about my injury, so he was able to work with me knowing what the problem was. He worked with me to get to the point where I was in very good shape on the knee. I still have problems, but most of the way I've been recovering. Our next prompt. We can move on here. Have you ever had an experience with people who have a difficult time communicating? I have had a a case where I was working with. And. A person. That was. Doing. A network evaluation. That's what I used to do. And the gentleman that I was working with had an extremely heavy Indian accent, and the Indian accent with the British wording made some of the times that it was hard to catch what he was saying.

And I and both of my parents were there and the horse was out of control. I couldn't stop the horse. And my brother, actually my brother was there too, and he was taking pictures of me falling off sound. And I fell flat on my back and I lost my breath. I couldn't breathe. And my father, who is a doctor, he jumped the fence and he immediately resuscitated me back to the breathing. And the the highlight of this story is my parents never went and watched me show horses again. They have stressed them out too much.

Two teams of 11 people each vie for control of. Umm. Yeah, so I think of that. Those eleven one is a goalie each. Each team has a goalkeeper and a goal. On a pitch of grass about the size of a football field, maybe. Yeah, so like 300 feet. Uh. Lengthwise, maybe like 150 feet Width wise, so that that comprises the boundaries of the playing field, the playing space and the 11 players including the goalie. UM comprise halves of the playing space so that that playing space is cut in half. There's 11 on one side, 11 on the other, and then at halftime the sides are switched. But the way it starts is. Um. A coin is flipped and whoever wins the coin toss, that team will start kicking the ball to its teammates. From the center of the field. Um. So what happens is it's 11 on 11. There are different lines of that 11, the way it's ordered on on the field, the the people in the front of that group of 11. Their main task is to score on the opposing goal. The ones behind them are kind of defense and offense. They can score, but. Their primary role is to distribute the ball to the people who will score and then the people behind them. It's usually three or four are like the last line of defense. They're called defenders and they they keep the ball far away from the goalie if they can. And the goalie is the absolute line, last line of defense, kind of guarding the goal and keeping the ball from going into the goal. On the major rules is that the only person that can use their hands except on out of bounds. Those are the goalies. The goalies can use their hands at any time, but like any of the players, they ever touch the ball, that's a penalty with their hand. They're they're just moving the ball by doing what's called dribbling or passing with their feet. Um. Scoring happens when the opposing team kicks the ball past the players and the goalie into the net, into the netted goal, and they can do that through what's called a penalty kick. A corner kick. Or just regular game play kick into the goal. The duration the contest will last 70 to 90 minutes and the teams that do the best. Are constantly moving the ball and triangles. I think this is my theory where they're passing. The ball to each other in triangular formations. They're spreading out and triangular formations over the playing field and giving. The person with the ball like. You know options of passage. You know passing of the ball to two people at different points in the triangle, and they're they're you can pass backwards, you can pass forwards, you can pass across the field to open space."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL40-2_278937_508414.wav", "azure_transcription": "Ohh my I'm quite sure I I could.

I was going home from Fermi Lab back to the house I lived in, sort of in the country between them, DuPage County Airport and. There's a little town of West Chicago and. As I was approaching my turn, I started squeezing the brakes to slow down and. The book started vibrating really badly. They didn't recognize it because I'd had back tires go low before, but never had a front tire or low before so. All I could think of was to squeeze the brakes harder, front brake and pretty severe brake and since the front tire had gotten really low, it just suddenly like down into the street and cost me into the ditch. No. I got up out of the ditch and. Rather 2 problems. One is that the back then there wasn't very. Good at wearing protective safety gears, so it's riding motorcycle without a shirt, even have pants and shoes and. Good. So that gravel and stuff all embedded in my shoulder did that I get with the shoulder, but the other problem was this thumb was just kind of. Dangling. Like it wasn't connected anymore because it wasn't this phone here was just broke and clear off. So. This was really too many years ago to remember. It's 1979, but I think some of the neighbors are driving into the same gravel drive that I lived in and. Help me roll the motorcycle kind of up the little hill a little bit and park the motorcycle and then? I. Maybe they gave me a ride home. I don't know. I just remember getting into my car. And then I had two cars, so one of the cars that would go to the DuPage County hospital and. Went to emergency room and they looked it over and they bandaged it up and made me an appointment to come back and on Monday, Friday apparently. I went back Friday."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto10a_441776_670346.wav", "azure_transcription": "Well, more recently, I guess. The whole world. Has suffered this. What do you want to call it? Crisis. Recession. Depression. Whatever it may be, the financial from financial end of it. I on paper only. I guess I've lost maybe $100,000. But as long as you don't sell nothing. You haven't lost it. If you understand what I'm saying. That's where a lot of people, and I don't understand the business world telling these people, especially the the mutual fund brokers and that telling people to cash their stuff in. And go to a mutual fund, Well, that's. To me it's absolutely ridiculous. As an example, I've got a lot of Procter and Gamble. And it was up Ohh. Last last summer, I guess around $74 a share. Right now it's about 48 or 49 now to tell somebody to sell that. And take a. 3035 dollars share loss. It's kind of ridiculous to me, but now that I guess that's the way these agents. You know, make their money by talking to people, the public, into relinquishing what they've got is that's good. Now I don't say you should keep all. Your stocks, but you give them a blue chip. You know then, I mean, I'm really surprised with the people selling the automotive. Chairs. That matter of fact, this last Friday I went out and bought 1000 shares of Ford. And also I put in bought 1000 shares of AK Steel now if you really are being retired. I can watch a lot of television as I've said earlier and I watch all the news programs, especially on a Sunday when you get a lot of diversified, you know opinions and. To do, to sell the automobiles out, It doesn't make sense. But now an AK Steel, that's the same way. They were, $74 a share and now I put a bid in for $6 a share. And I'm pretty cool. That was was 576 when I started playing phone tag with the broker. And so, like I said, last Friday I went to the third. Metal broker there and we put in a buy for it. Now if you don't understand what to buy means it will sell 6/21. Well, that's that. When it goes down to six, buy me 1000 shares of it. And my reason for doing that is. Obama wants to improve, excuse me, improve all the infrastructure. OK. Infrastructure means steel and that's where AK Steel comes in and although they haven't completed. You know, through Congress what they. Her wanting to do what they're trying to say by America, and I really don't believe in that. But the. That's really going to push the American steel up. Then all American industries are going to start making recovers. But it was funny. I just listened this morning on television before I'd come down here. In the state of Kentucky. Is making it illegal to buy any American flag that isn't made in the United States? They're trying to pass that right now, so that's. They to me, that was the most interesting thing to me and the. The worst thing was losing all that money. In my age, of course, I don't have to sell anything and I'm not going to sell it. And maybe my ears will help. My wife will.

We decided it might be time for us to start a family, but two more years went by and didn't happen, and after a minimal amount of medical intervention, not much. We decided to sign up with an adoption agency. And we had talked about this before we got married that we thought we would like to have a family and maybe, maybe it might be nice to adopt children. So now we have this opportunity. So we signed up with the adoption agency and after we had completed all of the paperwork, they said now you can wait and it might be a long time, but this was in 1968 when it was easy to get a child not like it is now. And five months into the procedure, I got a call one day. From our social worker who said, are you sitting down? And I said no, but I will. And she said we have a baby for you. We have a little girl. Can you come and get her tomorrow? Yes, we can tell her dad and I had been in the process of setting up the nursery and now he worked until 2:00 in the morning to finish painting and finish the finish the crib. And so we got to our 10:00 appointment. The next morning was in October. I still remember how beautiful the golden. Cottonwood leaves were on the trees. This was in Denver, Co. And we were invited to come into the agency and we filled out some papers. And then then then we were ushered into the little nursery and there in a little white crib wearing a tiny little pink dress with little white flowers, lay our baby. We sign more paperwork, picked her up and loved her and took her home and have been living happily ever since. Four years later we adopted another child.

This boy is playing with the soccer ball. He's being real reckless. Kicks it through this guys window and he's. Sitting in his living room, enjoying himself. And he startled.

The F84F has a. Your characteristic at full stall, which means that the nose will turn 30 or 40 degrees either to the left or to the right. You can't predict it, but it will do that.

And it could also see where the grass was carried forward by contacting with with the tail as it came in tail low. Well, pretty soon there came the ground. In retrospect, I can remember very well that the the horizon was jumping up and down. And the airplane did Yaw, but it still kept going in the same direction. It yawed. And as I say, I remember the horizon bouncing up and down, but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on. Well, eventually it did. It did come to rest in the IT had yawed to the right so that at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway, which is frequently in place, which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up. Well, they about panicked. Well, at which I followed the proper procedures. I cut all power. Turned everything off. And with my parachute still trapped on to me, I think I may well have set a record for the 50 yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing. I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again. All they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground. They towed it back in to the hangar on its own wheels. And it did fly again. So did I, of course. But in this, this moment of panic was it was only flat, you know, only a quick flash. It was the the thought was. I'll do what I know what I need to do, but people don't don't walk away from these things. I walked away. It was later determined that. While I was, I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of 340 knots. One of my buddies was in back of me. Also alone.

We had been on a a cruise and we had visited our children in in Orlando and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan. So I could see the foot doctor. And. Man, I don't remember what happened. But anyway, when I finally got to the foot doctor, she just explained that the reason that nail was lifting off was because when she had removed the ingrown toenail, a new nail was growing underneath. So she just took the top nail off. Took half a minute that was done, and then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting. And so, of course she. Feeling it and found the very painful spot and that led to X-rays which showed there was a small broken bone and which led to my having to wear a boot for a month. And then come back. Or more X-rays. So I came back to Arizona. Then I turned around and month went back to Waukegan. More X-rays and the stupid thing is not healed yet. Which is? Usual for me cause this whole scenario happened once before. And she says another month with the boot and to do ultrasound treatments every day and I forgot to do it. No, I did it yesterday and. She also told me that when I came back when I would be coming back at the end of this month, she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else. And of course she's following him. And nice thing about the visit is I really like that put doctor as a person and she's pregnant and she's going to have her second child.

OK, Once Upon a time. There was a young girl. And she had to go live with her step sisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore. So he brought her to this house where these step sisters and stepmother lived, and they took the girl in and turned out they really didn't treat her like a regular family member, that this girl had to do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got everything they wanted. And she was sort of like they're made. And her name was then Cinderella, because she spent a lot of time among the Cinders. By the fireplace. And in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball, and all the eligible women in the Kingdom were invited to the ball. So when they got the announcement, Cinderella knew about it. But of course the the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball, but she was going to make sure her daughters could go to the ball. So in preparation for the ball is the step. Sisters were getting ready and preparing their thing. Cinderella was among her little companions, who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house. And then they saw how sad she was and they wanted to help her and help make her address and get ready for this ball and such. But Cinderella? I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball. So as the day became closer, the step sisters were getting ready to go and they had beautiful dresses and she had to help mend them and. Let's see what happened. Um? Um, she, I guess she went out in the garden and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad and she was crying and she really wanted to go to the ball. And her fairy godmother had said, you know, you may go to the ball, just. Chair. She changed her truck into a beautiful dress and she said, fetch me a pumpkin and turned it into a coach. And the three mice came and they became the coachman and the drivers of this pumpkin. And so she was able to go off to this ball And when she got there the ball was in full swing and the step sisters had already had their chance to dance with the the Prince. And unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people. And one had a tick and in a creaky knee and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just. Things that they just didn't know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the Prince in a proper way. And then when Cinderella came at all, eyes turned to her and she came down the stairs and danced with the Prince. And there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love. And they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting. And suddenly the the clock struck 12 and she realized she had to go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight. And with that, she ran away. And in doing so, her glass slipper remained behind. She made her way home. She was a little sad because I guess she thought she'd never see this Prince again. And then the Prince was found the slipper, and he was determined to find the girl in the Kingdom who fit the slipper. So he and his coachman, whoever they are, went around to all the fair maidens and the Kingdom and tried the slipper on. And they did come to the home of the where Cinderella lived. And they, the step sisters, tried to get that shoe. And their foot wasn't going to fit. And then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe and it fits. And they get married and live happily ever after. And that was not the best version of the story I've ever heard."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL5-1_723274_946995.wav", "azure_transcription": "One day.

Where? There he saw Elliot. Elliott had an embarrassed, embarrassed look on his face and his head hung low, and Ralph remembered the time when he was little and he had hit a baseball into his neighbor's yard. And how embarrassed he felt. So rather than going outside and yelling at Elliot, Ralph went outside and he said, you know what, I did the same thing one day, let's figure out how we can fix it together. And they did. So here is a series of pictures. Take a look at all of them and then I'm going to ask you to tell me the story with the beginning, middle and end again.

You need to take the umbrella. And he said no, I don't, I don't need an umbrella, she said. Ben, you need to take the umbrella. He said Nope, I'm going to go without it. Bye. So we started walking to school. And as he walked to school, it started raining a little bit, but it got to school. It was OK. But at the end of the day he was walking home. It had been raining all day long. It was still raining. So on his way home he was walking through puddles, getting poured on. By the time he got home, he was trenched. And his mother was very unhappy that he had not taken the umbrella. He said, I know you were right. So the next day when he went to school, he took the umbrella and arrived at school. Nice and dry. So this first picture, look at everything that's happening and then tell me a story about what you see. Tell me the story with the beginning, a middle and an end. OK, Once Upon a time there was a little girl who had a cat named Spotty and Spotty one day went outside and climbed the tree, which very much upset the little girl who had been riding her tricycle and so she called her father and her father got out the ladder. And climbed up to go get Spotty the cat. But the little girl in her father's dog, Barky, came along and Barkey knocked over the ladder. So then the father was trapped in the tree, trying to get Spotty. And so the dog was barking so loudly that the, I don't know mom was inside and she saw this happening from the window. So she called the fire department and the fire department.

He died or ran away and the stepmother started treating her bad. They treated her like like a servant.

I wish I could live in the palace, I guess. And the guy came in and he was.

So I guess Cinderella got invited too, because she started looking for a dress. And she got a pink dress and when she was on her way out, I guess. The sisters ripped her necklace off. I guess they were being mean or jealous because she was pretty or something. Um, but she went outside and was laying on a horse thinking, that was. And she met someone. Like she had a one.

But she kept running and got to the house and the little mice were there with the key. I guess the lettering before. Anyone noticed? Got in. Did she get you? I don't think she got you on that.

Let's assume that you have two slices of bread. You then have to make a decision as to whether or not you're going to put butter on it, or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the Jelly. Some people prefer that they put the peanut butter on the bread first because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth. So, trying to satisfy as many people as possible, we're going to take a knife and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread. One slice or two, depending upon how much you want to fill the bread, and then we'll put the Jelly on top of the peanut butter. Put the two pieces of bread together and you are finished after putting it on a plate and finding a napkin. Well, Jeannie came crying to her father who and she was a terribly upset.

There, the mother of one little boy had decided to have a birthday party for his 4th birthday and they took the book, the boy and his two friends and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day. And we're planning to come back home to celebrate later. In order to prepare for the party, the mother had baked the three layer cake and was really excited that the boy would like it. However, when they came home from the park, they found a bad surprise. The dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing on the crumbs all through the house. So when they got home, the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with the Bruin.

Ironically enough, the pain started to travel down my back. I could feel it moving. It wasn't a muscle. I couldn't. I'm. I'm much sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle, it wasn't a bone. Something was really weird and it was moving. They were kidney stones. Eventually I found out, but. I remember thinking I don't have yet insurance here and I've just moved back and I haven't been to a hospital here in 20 years. This is going to be really horrible. And and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where I had a fever of 101 or something and it just was doubled over and couldn't even really stand as this thing was making its way down. So we went to the hospital and the first thing I walked in is I said I'm sorry to bring you a bad news and the woman said why did my husband die? That's the receptionist. And I said that's a good joke, but anyway, I don't have insurance. And she said that's no problem, that's you're going to get it. Come on in. And I remember thinking, OK, this is going to be alright. Three hours later, after some medicine and vomiting, at least 40 times because of the intense pain, the most intense pain I've ever had in my life. Just imagine like stones going through that little opening, sorry and. Suddenly and I was having news all strainer thing and seeing them come out and ohh and then for about a day at the blood and everything else. But I was amazed. The body and how. And once.

And again, I'd never really had to have an any anesthesia or anything like that. So it was kind of a new experience. Of course it was an outpatient situation, but since a lot of my friends had had it done before, I kind of knew what to expect. I think it's probably good that there were not video cameras on your phones back then because I know now people have videotape people coming out of the anesthesia. But I do remember it was such a strange feeling since I had never had anesthesia before. So it was. Kind of interesting and I just remember being having the cotton all in my mouth when when I was trying to talk and it was rather painful. I remember that too. And then having just, it took a long time to recover from that as far as just cleaning and making sure that everything healed properly. So I guess there was like a minor surgery that I had. I know from last week that you do in fact have experience with people who have a difficult time communicating. So again. Just share what problems that you've experienced with people who have a hard time communicating and. Things that you've done about that to help? Well, I think now that we're starting to go more online with our research, it's been really interesting to me. Having to communicate with folks, it's a little bit more difficult when you're on a telephone call or a video conference call with someone who has aphasia. I'm, I'm really surprised at how well that they've been doing to kind of adjust to this. But I do have to remember that even more so than when you're in person to slow my rate, make sure that I ask questions, ask yes, no questions. I was talking with a woman. Who is actually in in Mexico? They went on a trip to Mexico before the quarantine and they actually kind of got stuck down there because they don't want to put her on a plane. In. So anyway, it was kind of a not very good connection. It was breaking up a little bit and we were talking about her possibly doing one of our studies. So it was, it was a challenge to help because she did have some some probably moderate aphasia. Her son was on the phone too, so I was on the speakerphone. So just that whole thing of really slowing everything down, asking your question several times and making sure that she had plenty of time for me to understand her as well. So that was definitely, definitely makes you think. About all of those strategies that we need to use with our patients or participants who have aphasia and I realize how challenging it must be for them right now when they don't have a lot of one-on-one communication with folks. Can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad from when you were a child or more recently. Again, you can tell the same story as last week, or you can choose a different story. Well, different story. I have lots of stories. I think all speech pathologists have lots of stories."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL20-2_644282_861680.wav", "azure_transcription": "And he is very surprised to see his sucker ball come.

But I think the little boy says, oh, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. And it was. We'll assume it's the home of a neighbor. I'm so sorry, Sir, that I broke your window. But I will work for you to try to replace it. And so that's what he did. So again, these panels are pictures. Tell a story. Take a second to look them over. They go left to right and then bottom and then left to right again. Whenever you are ready, tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle and an end. The little boy has his backpack on and he's getting ready to go to school and his mom says it's raining outside or it's going to rain and you better take an umbrella. And he says no, look, the sky is completely clear. I don't want to take an umbrella, but I think you better the weather weather report says it's going to rain. But he won't do it. And so she said, alright, but I have told you it's going to rain. So out goes the little boy on his way to school. And sure enough, pretty soon it starts raining. Drip, drip. And it's then he he keeps on. He he starts to continue, but then he turns around and it's raining even harder now and he's really upset and he. Runs back home drip, drip, drip on the kitchen floor and his mother says, I told you and he said, well you are right, I do need an umbrella. So this time he was willing to take the umbrella. He put it up and off he went in the rain on his way to school. All right, so this first picture tells a story. Take a second to look it over, and whenever you're ready, tell me the story you see with the beginning, a middle, and an end. Well, this is the story of a little girl who has a cat and one day. The dog began chasing the cat and chased the cat up the tree. And they're The cat sat and would not come down. And as you can see from the picture, the dog is still barking, so of course the cat isn't going to come down. And she probably cried and cried. And finally her father came out and what's the matter? Kitty cat is up in the tree and the dog is still barking. So the father said, all right, I'll go up into the tree and get the cat. And so he did, but the dog is still barking. It would have been nice if he had put the dog in the garage, but he didn't think to do that. So he is now up in the tree trying to get, but he can't get as far out as the cat is. If he did, he would surely break the limb and he would fall. So as you can see from his expression, he is stuck. Somebody, maybe the mother in the house, saw what was happening and she called the fire department and so here comes the fire department. They are going to put up a ladder against the tree and hopefully they will get the dog to go away. And rescue the man. And then after they do that, the cat is still up in the tree, but the dog is no longer barking so the cat jumps down.

I need that umbrella so that I don't ruin the school's tablet. So he went back and that's what he did.

But what I came to find out about her was that she was Jewish and Christian. She was in a concentration camp. In Germany. And. Thank goodness she she managed to make it through.

And in the process of all of this, of all the planning, we spent a lot of time together, and she told me much about her life in Germany and about the terrible, terrible times. Of the Holocaust. And one of the things that I remember vividly, the only reason that she really lasted, her mother was Gentile. Her father was Jewish.

This person was uncle was the was her mother's brother and he was of course Gentile and he was the police officer in the town where she lived. So he was able to keep her off the list of the children who were going off to the concentration camps. But finally at the end he couldn't do it anymore. And she told me one time, which just broke my heart. He sent her and her three siblings off to concentration camp. And but he would not look at them. And her mother, the mother and the father. Managed to stay. In Dresden. And they were both killed in the fire bombing in Dresden just before the war was over. But probably that was one of the most. And and it was second hand to me. It was all it was not something that happened to me, but it was something that I became very much involved in because. I listened to her stories and she didn't just tell me the story. It was things she just told me, little by little. And finally, in the village where she grew up, they were going to. They they asked her to come back. They wanted her to come back. They paid her, would pay her. You know, to get her to come, they they wanted. They wanted to closure for them too, because. It was a terrible time. And she wouldn't go. And she wouldn't go.

We have to be honest, they were very ugly. So there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father apparently died. She was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters, and they used to make her clean and they used to make her cook. And they were very mean to her and they made her live in the attic and they made her old ugly clothes. She was very, very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative. And she befriended all the animals in the house, the mice and the birds. And. When she looked out the window every day, she used to see this beautiful castle where the Prince lived with his mother and father, the King and Queen of.

And they knew how to sew, and they knew how to accessorize, and they knew how to design dresses, apparently. So they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella.

And the pain would only be gone as I lift my leg off in the ground. I had no idea what was causing this, but the pain was so severe I equated it to the pain you get when you hit your thumb with a hammer. But in this case, you know, you hit it with the hammer and it's gone. As long as I stood on that knee, that intense pain would be there. So I finally went to an orthopedic doctor and after taking X-rays and an MRI, they found that my medial meniscus had a hole in it. He called it a pot handle tear where the femur had actually gone through and the meniscus was still totally intact, but it looked like a teapot where you have that slender handle above the top of it. And he said, well, that's going to continue to do that to your femur. Unless we go in and take it out. So I set up for surgery and you know, you you, you planned these surgeries. And unfortunately, things don't always go real well. I had surgery planned at a particular time of the day. I think this day it was 1:00 PM. So I got there. You had to go there an hour or so ahead of time. I ended up having it done at Saint Joe's Hospital. Even though I was going to be in in outpatient and I went in there and they you know clean your bag up and everything and it turns out though that this particular set of. Surgeons had a lot of other emergencies that came up. So my appointment at 1:00 in the afternoon actually took place at 6:00 in the afternoon. And they finally wheeled me into the room. I'm not having any idea what they were going to do. I'm pulled into the room and they put me off of the the one bed onto the real bed. I I feel these doctors like grabbing my leg and slamming it up against this rubber mount to the left of my leg. And I knew that they were going to do arthroscopic surgery, but I hadn't not had any inkling on how this would all happen. In fact, I thought it might have been so simple, I had asked them to just numb the leg."}, {"segment_name": "wright42a_1138595_1344291.wav", "azure_transcription": "Then she turned the pumpkin into the coach.

It was either maybe his house or the neighbor's house. Um. The soccer ball went through the window and knocked over the lamp and it looks like the guy's face is very surprised. He takes the soccer ball and looks out the window and. Is probably going to go top to the boy. And OK, great. We do the same thing with these pictures. And then whenever you're ready, I'll have you tell me a story. What they're beginning a middle and an end. Um, so there's a little boy that is and his mom is trying to give him. Give him an umbrella before he goes outside. And the little boy shakes his hand and says no, I don't want the umbrella. Um, thing goes outside without the umbrella and it starts to rain. It rains on him and it gets him all wet and he's going through the puddles and it's raining really hard and he's trying to cover his head, probably wishing he had the umbrella. When he gets back home, Mom has a very stern look on her face and and the kid is soaking wet. And. Looks like he's probably learning a lesson to listen to what mom says, so the next time he goes out, he carries his umbrella and lunches lesson. OK, and same thing with this one. It's kind of an entire scene. So take a look at the whole thing and then you can tell me a story with the beginning and middle and end. OK. Well, it looks like first. Um. It looks like two things are happening at the beginning. It looks like a cat got stuck in a tree and a dog ran a man up the tree and they're both stuck. Uh, somebody called the fire department. Um, so the little girl can get her cat down and so they can maybe get that man down. It looks like they before they tried. Before they called the fireman, they tried to maybe use a ladder, but it looks like it was too short. And after they called the fireman, the fireman came in and they are going to get the cat down and get the the man down who was run up by the dog and. Everyone will go home and be happy and um. Maybe the cat May and the man will learn their lesson not to climb the trees."}, {"segment_name": "UNH1043_1487387_1684151.wav", "azure_transcription": "The bases are safe spots where they cannot be out. If they're caught between bases and someone has the ball in their possession and tags that person, they're out. So that's another way that an out can be generated. Um. Let's see. The way that a run is scored is if a batter successfully makes it all the way around from first, second, third and then touches back on to home plate. That's one point or one run. I just mentioned that there's a field beyond the diamond. There's usually a fence behind that. Those those players that are in the outfield, it's called the outfield if the batter hits the ball. Over that outer fence. Then it's a home run, and so he gets a free, unimpeded trip around from each base. And that's a point. If the batter hits a home run and there was someone ahead of him that was on first base, that person comes all the way around and he scores a point and then the batters gets a point. So it's a two run home run. So you you try to get more points or runs before you are, all of your 27 outs are exhausted. If you are taught if both teams have the same amount of runs at the end of the ninth inning, then it's a kind of a sudden death. Like whoever gets the most runs where both teams equally have a chance to score runs after that they win the game. So if you if you're tied in the ninth and then the visiting team comes up first because they start the game, they start batting, they score a run, they get, then they get 3 outs, the other team doesn't score, they get their chance, they get. With no runs, then, the visiting team has won the game. There's no time the the games can conceivably last forever. The the the only way to stop the game is to get all the outs and have more points. Some of the strategies that people employ are you want a really good picture to make it very difficult for the batter to be able to hit the ball. And there's different types of pitchers. There's some people that can throw really fast. There's some people that not throw as fast, but they are able to make the ball curve in the air somehow. And then you also want your defense every position to be very skilled at catching the ball and throwing the ball quickly. So because if you have a player that can catch the ball out in the field and has a very strong arm can throw the ball to first base and before that batter gets there then they're they're they're valuable for the offensive team. Some skills that you want is you want someone that is strong that has really good hand eye coordination and. That that can hit the ball far and hard. Some specialized players are there, they're skilled at speed. So if you have someone that is marginal hitting, but he's fast and they can hit the ball and then but they're fast the first base and can get there before the other team is is able to get the ball, then some, that's a valuable, valuable position as well.

So right away she put Cinderella to work, waiting on everybody and doing everything in the book that I knew. When I was a child, she cleaned out Cinders from the fireplace, but they don't do that anymore. But she waited on everybody. She was a servant, and the girls were top drawer. In the house. And.

She kind of passively aggressively started, you know, not participating in things or you know. Just kind of being rude, I guess. So it finally, you know, broke my last little straw and I yelled at her one day and kicked her out of the group. So. They did about it. OK, well, I'm afraid of heights. Even a little heights, even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder. So I decided. One year to get my boyfriend skydiving. You know. Thing you know, jump. I guess that's what you call a jump for his birthday. And then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too. And maybe it would get me over my fear of heights. So. We went skydiving and it was terrifying. And when I when we jumped out of the plane, you know you're attached to someone else.

Someone saw her, called the fire department, and now the the firemen are there and one of them has made his way out to the water with the life vest on and it's probably going to try and strap her to him.

So please look at everything that's happening in this picture and tell me a story about what you see. And we'd like the story to have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you may. OK, so. The little girl was. Sitting on the porch board and she heard a bird sing. And when I didn't see the bird that was singing, she didn't see it. So she walked toward a tree. Toward the sound of the bird singing. And. While she was there, she saw the cat. And even though the cat is just sleeping. She wanted. To bring the cat down from the tree. So. Ohh yeah, so the actually the dog chased the cat up the tree. So while the bird was singing and the girl was sitting on the porch, the dog had found the cat and chased the cat up the tree. That's why the dogs there. And. But she still followed. She didn't see any of that. She just wanted to see the bird and then saw the cat. And asked her. Oh. She wrote her tricycle. See the cat. Um. So she asked. She tried to rescue the cat but couldn't. She tried to stand up on her tricycle and didn't didn't work, couldn't reach it. So she went and got her dad and the ladder. Well, he got the letter. She wouldn't think about that. And they went and climbed up the tree. He went and he climbed up the tree with the ladder and then the ladder fell and the little girl's too young to pick up the ladder, so he's stuck and the cat stuck or there and.

And you can see that they tell stories, and I just want you to tell me a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, OK? Once Upon a time there was a little boy. He was getting ready to go to school and his mother came and said before you go to school, you need to. Take your umbrella because it's supposed to rain today. The weatherman said it was supposed to rain and the little boy said, I don't want to take umbrella to school. None of the other kids take their umbrellas to school. And so he finally talked her into I don't want to take the umbrella and she finally said OK, but if it rains, you're going to get wet. So I don't want to hear any complaints. So he makes it about halfway to school and guess what? It starts raining. And then it starts raining even harder and he has to run back through the puddles in the rain to his house. And he comes back and he has absolutely soaked from head to toe. And the mother says, well, he said I should have listened to you, I should have taken the umbrella. So she dries him off, She gives him the umbrella and he heads back to school. But this time he's he's dry all the way to school under the umbrella, even in the rainstorm. OK, great. Now we have two more short stories. So there's this sequence of pictures, and I just want you to again look at the pictures that they tell a story and tell me a story with the beginning, a middle and an end. So a young boy lived in the neighborhood and loved soccer and he was constantly kicking a soccer ball around his yard and down on the street and everywhere he went. And one day he was going down the sidewalk and he kicked the soccer ball and it bounced off the side of his foot right through the plate glass window of one of his neighbors home. So his neighbor was sitting watching TV at his house and crash. Here comes this soccer ball through the window. And so he was upset about it and he picks the ball up and he looks out the window and sees the boy. And the boy is just very apologetic and says that he'll mow the man's lawn or clean his garage or clean his attic to to make up for the cost of the broken window. And so the man said that he would just hold his ball until all that was done and the window was replaced and they made their deal. And that was that. OK, great. OK, now the last story that I want you to tell me. It's a little bit different. I just want you to tell me how to make a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.

And then the father got involved and he said I can climb up and get the cat for you. Buddy got up in the tree and the branch started to wiggle and wobble and he got scared.

They followed me as far as exams went and three years later I went to the radiologist and. In his examination, he said. My goodness, I feel a lump. It's just where the other one was. So he was in the same building as a surgeon. So I. Call. They called up and the surgeon could see me. So he looked at it and he said, Oh my goodness. So I guess within three or four days I had a mastectomy and that was outpatient. And what they decided to do after that was put me on, oh, it's a drug. They don't use any tamoxifen. So I was on tamoxifen for five years and I was glad to get off of that and since then I have had no signs of cancer and for a while they thought it was in my lungs and they.

Well, let's see. All right. Well, there was a period of time when I was approximately 4849 years old when I began having a series of lung collapses. And what a mysterious thing this was.

And it was never complete. It was only about 15 to 20% of white. There's always my right lung.

I found a study who reported 69 other women who have had a similar situation and the doctor said, well, you might be right. Will send you to a surgeon. So I went to the surgeon and I said this is what I think I have. And he said, well, we'll do surgery, I don't think that's it, but we'll do surgery and we will see what's going on with you since you've had five of them. And so I had pulmon ectomy, and the doctor did a procedure in which he did not look at my diaphragm, but instead he. And cemented the top part of my right lung to the cavity that holds it in place so that the next time I would have a bleed into this area, if that's what it was. In fact, my lung would not fall down. And create a partial collapse. So that's what happened. After that, I had two or three more periods in which I did have the initial burst of pain when I think this happened. But I did not have a lung collapse. So in the end the surgeon said, well, I guess that's that is what it was. I guess you probably did have a little bit of endometriosis but bled into the pleural cavity. So I went back to see my family doctor.

The children. Told me that there was a big animal. Looking out of this. Area. So I'm thinking, well, children, but nevertheless, I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out. And then we we went outside and we saw a. Raccoon or possum? I'm not sure the difference was its big claws. Looking out at us from the. Air vents, I guess you call those that are in the. Foundation of the House. And that really scared me. I thought, if that thing gets in the house or gets out, it can bite the kids and it might be rabid, Rabid. So I called the. Animal shelter I think it was and they told me that they everybody was on lunch. And so they wouldn't be there for an hour, which I blew my stack and told them that I wanted someone there now. Because if someone gets bit, I will sue the city. So somebody came out and the. Men. Were not happy to see this possum either, because he really looked mean and they took off the vent and somehow they caught him. And then they discovered. I believe this is they discovered.

Because the bread is frozen, it's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the Jelly after you've spread the peanut butter and the Jelly. Slap the two sides together. Turn them over like this. Cut them in half or quarters. You can cut on the diagonal. You can cut crosswise. You can cut vertical. You can cut them into as many pieces as you want.

And they've come, and they've got a ladder, and they're going to come over and set the ladder up, get dad out of the tree, and I'll probably get the cat out of the tree too.

It was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become sore and aggravated. So I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out. The best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better. But afterwards going home I had to take medication to help me sleep and make my throat. Little better, which gave me vivid dreams and I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a Buffalo. And when I woke up screaming at my mother had come in to take care of me. And it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake. And apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy. After about a week I got better and I was happy that I never had to do that again. Have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating?

I realized how important it is to have someone with you when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked. The towels were like sandpaper. You were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower. Uh, they didn't come. So I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel. I have veins that are very difficult to get blood, so I'd always say kiddingly to the people, are you really good at this? And one man named Joe L told me he was terrific. He he, I no problem. After about 20 pokes in my hand, I said could you find someone else to draw blood? Because we're not getting it done here. And um. It was, really. All I could do to get better so I could get out of the place because it's too bad that the staff is so overworked and probably underpaid. And that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need. I can also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night. Of course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things. And she couldn't find the bathroom, so she just used whatever facility she could find. And when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved, they just said, well, you'll probably have to go on with a cancer patient that's dying. So. I was so unaccustomed to hospitals and I'm probably unaccustomed to. The treatment there, because I'm going back to Iowa thinking I've never had that kind of situation before and I was sort of on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get out of there. So that was my experience. That's probably the worst experience I've ever had in the hospital because everything else has always been one done very well.

It was in July and it was just a normal day. I was a happy, carefree child playing with my friend down the street. And it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom. You you went out the door and came in for lunch, and then you went out the door and there really weren't very many parameters and there were lots of fun. Adventures to be had and came home to find out that he had had a They didn't use the word stroke, but that's what he had. That he had to go to the hospital from work. And so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home, he'll have these cookies. And then the next morning I remember waking up and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like. I have that feeling of what it felt like. To find out that, you know, he wasn't coming home and just as a child, an innocent child kind of coming to terms with life and death, saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing, having that be my first experience with death. And I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who was in the nursing home, she was around because she, she kind of lived with us for a while. And it was just she actually, I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard. Everyone went to all the adults. Went to the funeral at night. I just remembered that and I was hysterical crying. I was so, so sad and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me. And it worked. Ohh. She wasn't being mean, but I was beyond being consoled at that point and I I felt very alone in my grief for some reason, even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather. But anyway, that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future and I remember a time when I was in. 6th grade and we were having a sleepover in my friend's backyard. Happened to be with a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots. A girl who lost her young brother to leukemia. The other girl had lost her grandmother and I had lost my grandfather and we it was like they could make a movie about the bond. We were all in the tent and we were just talking and I can see us all sitting there and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life and we put it out there. It was probably the safest place to ever let it go and we all just. Just let it out. And I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this. And it's the good thing. So that's why I think this story is, is so important to me is because it was something that affected my life, you know, as I grew up. And also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didn't know about angels then, but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe and he can sort of watch over me, if you will."}, {"segment_name": "wright09a_1070027_1243501.wav", "azure_transcription": "One day family mouses.

Lists of things that she wanted done around the house. But we managed to work out a pretty good system of. You know, she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately. On a pad of paper, which he always kept with her and that seemed to help a lot because, you know, she could remember something short term. But now from now, forget it. But just by carrying that pad around with her all the time, she was able to make lists of things. So when I came home, I knew what she wanted done and we were able to, you know, bridge the gaps for a while until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home. I've had a stress free life. OK, OK, when I was in high school. Alright. Was out with some friends at Presque Isle. There's no death in this story. And we were walking along and it's all rocks along the edge of Lake Superior. It's not a beach at that particular spot. And it was a big rock Cliff on one side, and I looked over at it and I thought I could climb. And one of my friends said, I don't know, it's awful high. Ohh no I think I can climb it. Well, I managed to climb. Almost to the top. It was probably a 60 or 70 foot Cliff. And I got up. Within about 5-10 feet to the top and then ran out of handholds. I was looking down. Didn't want to look down anymore. It was way far down. But I was able to move off to one side and there was a tree that was actually hanging over the top of the Cliff. And I was able to reach up with one hand and get a hold of it. And then pull myself up. But at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was.

She always she had to do all the cleaning and all the cooking and all the washing and take care of them and didn't get treated nicely. And she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes and she wasn't given the best food to eat. And anyway, she was just treated horribly. Wendy, the stepmother and the two step sisters get an invitation from the palace to come to a ball. Cinderella, thinking she's a member of the family, thinks she can go along but she can't. So she helped has to help the two step sisters and stepmother get ready for the ball and then they go. After they leave. She's very disappointed because she really wanted to go to the ball and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears. And tells her that she can go to the ball, but she has to be home by midnight, so she gives her beautiful dress to wear. Lovely new shoes and turns a pumpkin into a carriage. Turns the mice into horsemen and horses and the only rule is be back by 12. So Cinderella went to the ball. She had a wonderful time. Nobody knew who she was there. Who was like, oh, who's that woman? Who's that woman? The Prince danced with her the whole evening, showed a lovely time. And then, as the clock was striking 12, she realized she had to leave. So she ran out. In running out, she lost one of her shoes, which was a glass slipper, made it to the carriage and got home just as the carriage turned into a pumpkin. Following that, the Prince found the missing slipper and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper. So he travelled all over the Kingdom trying the shoe on women's feet to see if it fit. It didn't fit anybody. Finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly step sisters and he tried it on their feet. It didn't fit any of them and he saw Cinderella and said why don't you try it? Or possibly, she said why don't I try it and. And tried to do it and it fit. And he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after having danced with her for a few hours. And she, of course, of course, being swept off her feet, agreed to marry him, not understanding what it would mean that she just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and cooking.

So mostly if she starts talking and she talks less than she used to. I'll redirect if she gets into something that is agitating to her or kind of super sad if she keeps repeating it, but that doesn't happen very often. Most of the time she's she kind of discovers a new that she's talking to people. Like you can see her look away and then she'll look at the screen and kind of, oh hi, delighted to see you. So she's getting a little better at at understanding that this or that. She seems to be able to remember that she's done something like this before and that she looks, if she looks in a certain place, we can see her and she can see us. And that her memory has been. Fading over the last decade, but looking back, I realized she had trouble even before then, but had better coping skills and it was manageable. She made a lot of lists.

Like, I didn't touch this bug. Like this book fell off the shelf. And you were called Spirit Junkie by this woman named Gabrielle Bernstein. And I opened up that book. And my whole life changed after that. She broke down. The gift of healing, of going into your past and going into your traumas through things like prayer that I'd never heard of and I went to a Catholic school and was kind of like religion is like politics. It's not for me. And she just opened up this door that you can heal through this. This way of praying with asking for help is something that was so foreign to me to just ask for help. And so I started doing her. Writing exercises. I started doing their meditations, like actually through myself, into this lifestyle. I started praying every night. I started praying every morning. And I started noticing that my life was getting lighter, that I was attracting things in my life that I couldn't have it before because I was blocking myself. And she was showing me this box, right.

Joe realized the cat was in the tree and loaded twice. Cycle out. To try to get the cat out of the train, but. She couldn't reach the cat and said she called her dad. And your dad put a ladder up, went part way up the tree and couldn't reach the cat, and ladder fell down. So then. Well, somebody called. 911 Fire Department came. And. With any. Luck, they will be able to put their ladder against the tree. And get that back off out of the tree and. I think the cat will be up there until it feels like coming down. Typical cat.

I'm going to describe as an acoustic neuroma and a craniotomy for acoustic neuroma. I discovered this when I was talking on the telephone. Working at the office had telephoned up like this on this ear so I can write like this. Take notes. That was a fairly long phone call I guess Steph net. So I switched the telephone around to the other side and volume sounded about twice as much as it was on the left side. I switched the phone back to this side and it was much quieter, so I figured there's something wrong with the ear on my left ear is not hearing the way it should. Anyway, went to ENT specialist and he diagnosed it. As an acoustic neuroma, but just a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull. We did some research, found the surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery went out, had the surgery performed for the surgery itself. First thing I do is shave this side of your head. I got a haircut before I went out so it would be short so I wouldn't look like I had real long hair on this side. I remember the prep. I remember the shaving for the for the surgery. Then you're under, you're totally out of it. I didn't wake up and have consciousness until what I think was the 2nd day following the surgery. They keep you out because they don't want you moving around. The surgery involves cutting a hole in the head so they can get into where the nerves are. Get the tumor taken off of it afterwards. It was a recovery that took. Ohh, a week or 10 days before we recovered enough to be able to come back home, I had a nice scar up the side of the head, kind of shaped like a light bulb. And they put a stereo tape on it to kind of hide it, keep it sterile. The nice part about heading back was we'd go to the airport and I'd sit in the chair and I'd, I'd sit so that that side of my head was toward the ticket counter. And my wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say my husband's had some brain surgery and he's not feeling very good. And is there any possibility that? We could move up to first class and everybody would take a look at me, slumped over, looking half dead, this big scar running up the side of my head. We got moved up the first class on every flight.

So you take the bread in your hands, dip it into the peanut butter and spread it over, and then you dip it into the Jelly on the other side and put it all over the other piece.

My favorite peanut butter can be a mini brand, but I'd like to chunky style because I eat a lot of peanuts. I eat a lot of almonds. I just eat them for the nutritional value. So I do eat considerable peanut butter. From a sandwich standpoint, it's a little bit different from me to even think of eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich, but I usually eat most of my peanut butter on saltine crackers. But in the case that I am really really hungry and I'm not just eating a snack, then I would, after locating my peanut butter, place it out on the counter. I will then go and find some bread. Sometimes they keep my bread in the refrigerator so it doesn't mold so. And if I had done that, I will usually toast the bread. Because I don't like it to be cold when I eat it. Otherwise I may have taken it off the counter for my peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches. I would like something like either a regular white bread or maybe even an Italian or French bread because it would give me the extra flavor of the crust. So once I've located my bread, I now have my peanut butter. I would go to my drawer where I keep my utensils and bring out a butter style knife or a dinner type knife and begin spreading the. Peanut butter onto their bread. What I'd like to do in in in here, this is where the jelling messes you up is that when I make I usually do straight peanut butter sandwiches where I would put plenty of peanut butter on each side of the well, on one side of, but on both sides of bread. In this case I have to go and alter my plan and have them put the peanut butter only on the one piece of bread. And I would use the Jelly on the other now since I don't have a whole lot of Jelly in. At my house, I do keep at least one. Bought over jar, whatever you call it, in my refrigerator, and it'll usually always be strawberry. Just like strawberry. And it's just like a it's a good default Jelly. So after I got that out of the refrigerator, I would do the same with that, spreading it onto one slice of bread and then smashing them together and eating it and enjoy."}, {"segment_name": "NEURAL6-2_952469_1110056.wav", "azure_transcription": "My dad learned a lot of German, but I just barely learned some.

Start OK, so I have a good friend and we started way back. We lived. We've lived all over the country and our lives have kind of paralleled each other. Until when I was in Massachusetts and she was in Virginia. So anyway, we would meet once a year. We both now, well, we were always married when we knew each other and now we have kids and kids. They were middle school age. We started these girls weekends and it became an annual thing and typically we went to Philadelphia. We would drive or fly into Philadelphia. We met there, or sometimes Baltimore, and they would always start. The first night would be like up late, which every time we say we're not going to do it because it always killed our first full day together. But we'd be up late and we would just drag the hotel chairs in front of a window and wine, and we packed cheese and crackers and grapes. Whoever drove, brought, you know, packed whatever they could. The other person would pick up a bottle of wine from the liquor store on the way. And anyway, we would sit the evening and catch up and then the next day. We would get up and have a delicious breakfast out or just a cup of coffee and then we would go and and Philadelphia, there was this. First time, which then became a tradition. We stumbled upon the store we couldn't figure out. The lighting was a little weird, the flooring was a little off. Anyway, it turned out to be a great consignment shop. And unbelievable clothes. I mean like just unbelievable clothes. We would spend hours in there, we would try on and we'd go home bags and then we'd bring those back to the hotel and then we go out for our happy hour somewhere and then we go out for dinner is no kids, no cooking. And then sometimes on some of the weekends we would do typically the weekend enough was too expensive, so we would just do like a treatment like. A facial somewhere. The older we got and the more entitled and more disgruntled we became. So we'd go for like a facial or something. And then on Sunday we would always go out for breakfast again, and then whoever had the car would drive the other one to the airport. And that was it. It was always our it was a great girl's weekend.

Two weeks or more and they either pull their act together or they got shipped off to Capital District Psychiatric Center. So that was a huge motivation for them to be earnest in their in their endeavors. So it was a mental health population. So depending on the diagnosis and where they were, that day depended on how communicative, communicative they could be or chose to be. We we had. All sorts, all sorts.

And like cats are known to do, the cat wasn't coming down and it looks like the dog actually possibly chased the dog, the cat up the tree. In the meantime, we have a little girl with her tricycle and she. Has called her daddy to come help get the cat out of the tree. Daddy took a ladder to the tree and somehow I'm going to guess also again, the dog. Knocked the ladder down so dad is up the tree. He hasn't got the cat. There's a bird singing that.

So I would just, I would, you know, in between that time, I would just stare. I had to stare at his lips and his eyebrows, you know the expression, it just like he was.

But it didn't. He just didn't really want to use it. So now. We have lived together for about 2 1/2 years without hardly any. You know. Vocal communication from Ted other than what I told you.

Are you cold? Do you want a jacket? And he can tell me yes or no. Recently we have tried something else called, well, it's our Scrabble tiles. We got Scrabble tiles and I put them into letterboxes for him. To see if that might work, if he could make some words to show me what he wanted, and we have had a very limited success with that. But I would not say it's the magic bullet. Ted can make a simple word if I ask him to. Such as cheese. What kind of sandwich do you want? Cheese or bacon? Or. What do you want to drink? And he can write. He will sometimes write juice. With the letter tiles. Only on 2 occasions have though has he been able to take the letter tiles and tell me what it is that he wants when I can't figure it out. So. I don't know if we can make that work or not. We'll continue working at it. Maybe we just haven't tried it 10,000 times. But mostly it's just. Ted can indicate that he wants something.

To get the speed up and then they were able to barely able to pull it out. And everybody's looking at me and I'm the Flash doesn't have the smile and. My crew is normally they're allowed to make 2 attempts and they said that's it, we're done. We're going back to Denver. We're not even we're done for the day.

It said my birthday was May the 15th, 19 and 83. It said to this woman had been born seven other children, all of which are dead. Now the midwife has signed it June the 15th. And she signed it the right year. She signed it in 1938, but June the 15th. She either signed it on the day I was born and nobody remembered or. She signed it a month later. So I had to get an attorney. To get the year. And they wouldn't change the date they said you need to. Notify your Social Security and your insurance companies that your you had used the wrong birth date. And the only way I had to find an attorney that knew me, that would certify that I definitely had not been born in 1983.

Doesn't matter what kind of bread, it's any bread. And then you get peanut butter. You get Jelly. And I guess there's lots of ways to do it. But the simplest way is just give us a knife. You know, get some peanut butter on there and then spread it over one piece. And then take the knife and then dip it in Jelly spread over the other piece. It's going to be harder with the peanut butter because peanut butter is real sticky and if your bread is really soft it's going to tears would be really careful. And the thing about the Jelly is that it's really clumpy, so it might take a while to like smooth out everywhere and so. Then you just put the two pieces of bread together so that the peanut butter and Jelly stick to each other, and then you eat it and that's how you make peanut butter."}, {"segment_name": "capilouto55a_1038140_1160300.wav", "azure_transcription": "Used a lot of poisonous stuff.

It's not your problem, it's mine, and after several times of asking them to repeat what they said, I've explained that. I have a hearing problem. I don't understand what you just said.
